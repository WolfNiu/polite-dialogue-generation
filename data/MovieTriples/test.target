i was beginning to think you ' d forgotten me .

<person> any porcelain dolls ?
i was thinking about it . you put me out of business --
i am not here , ol ' buddy . the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship , the missing gold , where it was going , or when it left hong kong .
that ' s reassuring .
yeah . your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia , <person> . so sometimes he does things and says things that don ' t make sense .
are you a friend of his or something ?
he was my father .
i ' m sorry .
you serve martinis , doncha ?
<person> .

no ! you can ' t let people leave .
i received a card from your store .
congratulations , you have a mailbox . the sale isn ' t for two weeks .
ms . <person> -- you work at a school for mutants in westchester , new york . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?
math . history . science . <person> .
what are you gon na gain from this thing here ?
now let me see here . i ' ve got to isolate that for a moment and think it over .
everything these days is made overseas .
you and <person> hit it off so well .
nobody ' s getting in here . you can tell them all that !
well , who the hell you think wants to get in there with you ? <continued_utterance> now why ' d you go and .
as i said . this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us .
i ' m listening .
this is a mistake !
<person> up !
what ? ! <person> officer ? you mean you ' re a criminal ?
well , not anymore , thelma , except for bustin ' parole , i haven ' t done one wrong thing .
should i have ?
think hard -- it ' ll come to you .
no , i think it was me . <person> , that ' s all .
i ' m dreaming about you . <person> .
-there ' s a body in the trunk-
-burn it .
they didn ' t want me when i was born . why should i care .
<person> .
<person> , damn , hurts looking at you .
now with a line like that , it ' s a shocker i haven ' t already .
wait a second , i thought we were hamburger guys .
and like every hamburger guy knows , when you get your one big chance at the good life , you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don ' t belong there and kick your sorry ass out .
who are you ?
it ' s mrs . it ' s <person> . spencer . from next door . is everything --
spell ?
write ! - can ' t you write ? look ! <continued_utterance> and what are your people called ? weena eloi .
keep me abreast will you ? chief <person> is understandably nervous . situations like these tend to yield grief . and we ' ve the fbi poking around our garden patch .
my ass first fritz , yours second . <continued_utterance> <person> has gone to ground and he ' s got a war chest to keep him there . the only way we take him quickly is to issue a citywide apb-
who ?
perkins . glad he ' s on our side .
<person> . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there ' s always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
what about ?
eternal recurrence . maybe it wouldn ' t be so bad .
we ' ve not gon na get to the cabin till after dark as it is , thelma .
then what difference does it make if we stop ? come on . i never get to do stuff like this .
this is a snakeskin jacket , and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom .
<person> honky cracker mumbo jumbo .
what ' s that for ? it feels cold .
new ports are sometimes a bit tight . <person> ' t want to hurt you .
i believe in this moment , that ' s all . there is nothing else . come on . he must weigh <number> pounds .
you hit me , <person> ? you hit a woman , you motherfucker ! <person> ' t your momma ever teach you anything . ? <continued_utterance> well ?
somebody ' s taken it . i can ' t find it !
<person> , you want me to come in after you ? !
<person> ' s get something straight here , <person> . i ' ve been <number> years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away . i spent almost a year on <person> alone , with the trial , the testimonies , the background investigations . i didn ' t come here today to look in your goddamn folders . in fact , i wouldn ' t have come here at all if you ' d done your job right .
mr . <person> , this is a hospital , not a penitentiary . everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient ' s folder . whether you can make sense of it or not . <continued_utterance> <person> is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic . they see themselves as victims , and they always blame other people for the way they are . when <person> killed the mandrakis kids , it wasn ' t an act of hostility against the children but against their parents . he was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood . the criminal side of <person> is one of terrible , symbolic vengeance .
<person> ' s dead
what ?
hi , <person> ' <person> . you look old . <continued_utterance> this job ' s going to kill you . if i don ' t first . <continued_utterance> if you ' re home it means either jack and <person> have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you , or --
-- we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal . he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president . i think we ' ve won .
she ' s looking for a payout , dude . just buy her stake and give her an exit .
what the hell does that mean ?
of course not .
i mean . it ' s a disaster , <person> !
and runs like one and talks like one and throws like one . probably takes a pee like one too -- just squats right down .
he smarted off to me the other day -- told me i was a bourgeois .
you want to use your old desk ? someplace to sit down ?
is it vacant ?
you ' ve met her ?
she ' s kind of a pill .
you shouldn ' t ' ve killed mr . <person> . you shouldn ' t ' ve done that . it was wrong . i ' m takin ' you both in for it .
what ? you got ta be kiddin ' . <person> , just go home ' fore you get hurt .
so what are you going to do ?
i have to go court .
i take him back with me , yeah ?
since i supplied the cutters , the horse is mine . this is fair , no ?
what can i tell you ?
how did the car get back here ?
it ' s just my mother and me . she ' s back in columbus . she couldn ' t come .
so how did you get here ?
because i don ' t want to see him hurt .
<person> ' t worry <person> . <person> and i had a little talk . we came to an understanding . i want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . <person> ?
no . iandiacute ; m . i donandiacute ; t know if we can do this without <person> . <person> puts her hand lovingly to his face . <person> takes her hand .
he put you in charge for a reason , <person> .
you mean a nanotech synthetic organism .
whatever .
yes . i ' m going to kill you pretty soon .
i see . how exactly ? <continued_utterance> well , i thought i ' d break your neck , then use you as a human shield , then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun . <continued_utterance> and what makes you think you can do all that ?
he was never able to reproduce them .
bad examples . <person> , <person> , i don ' t want to depreciate the loss here , but perhaps -- in a sense- this -- is for the best . <person> ' s eyes shift , study crabtree .
the smart play ' s to lay up .
these fans didn ' t pay thirty bucks to watch a tour star lay up on a short par five .
then it ' s the worst kind ?
they ' re all good , sir .
you weren ' t to know it was bad news .
he was riding <person> when he died .
tell it to the ones that did this to me .
i donandiacute ; t see these spikes youandiacute ; re talking about . iandiacute ; m going to give you an antibiotic for the - oh my god .
it ' s better i drop you off .
<person> , it ' s better .
dr . <person> , it ' s the law .
what about explosives ? any waiting period there ?
you haven ' t even looked at them once .
they look nice .
exactly .
. what ' s <person> done ?
maybe you should move back into the city ? get a new job . shake it up a bit .
nah . <person> called me . he ' s starting up a new fund out here in may so i ' m gon na wait for that .
you should be more careful . <continued_utterance> it ' s very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it ' s so hot .
no trouble at all , really . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t nothing .
i don ' t think sylvia ought to go on , unless you cut out the high kicks and let her do some easy waltzes . <person> easy waltzes .
you ' re kidding !
yes .
but this doesn ' t make any sense , <person> . if it ' s just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days . why the hell didn ' t we find it ?
thank the lord . well , you aint let me down yet , sailor . thats moren i can say for the rest of the world ?
you please me , too , peanut .
oh , yes . it ' s come over all the media now . you ' ve never been more famous . your face is everywhere , which of course just . makes it worse . i .
what ? tell me .
got a little action there , eh buddy ?
<person> , . i just bagged the elephant !
tell me more .
<person> , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
it isn ' t very warm . i think the weatherman ' s wrong about his forecast . those look like snow clouds to me .
they ' re cumulus clouds , at an elevation of seven thousand feet .
what are you ? the world ' s first homeless united nations boy band ?
hell , yeah . we just wan na do shows and bone hoes . <continued_utterance> we got a song fo ' yo . it ' s called `` shut up bitch and eat a dick '' . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
you ' re right . that is all tha matters .
well , <person> , you said you had what we want . we ' re waiting .
do you understand that you hold the keys to this prison ?
it wasn ' t sofia .
the learning academy . spring street .
<person> hold for that number . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> press your pound key now to connect with your request .
<person> ' t you dare .
what ?
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , <person> , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .
this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
<person> , she ' s just had her bottle . she ' s sleeping like a log . <person> ' s just leave her in the apartment . what can possibly happen to her ? she ' s as regular as clockwork . she won ' t wake up till <number> : <number> and we ' ll easily be back by then .
<person> , you ' re right , we won ' t be long .
you managed alright .
is this what ' s left of your army ?
i regret to inform you , sir , that <person> is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war .
. <person> ' t we already paid him for his services ?
it ' s mine to give . i didn ' t steal it .
i didn ' t say you did .
what ' s happening ?
something ' s wrong !
i was just trying to make conversation .
where is <person> ?
no way . no fuckin ' way .
how the hell do you know ?
you think i fear death ? i welcome it . i get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? she ' s beautiful isn ' t she ? you should have seen her before . <person> , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed .
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .
what did you say ?
i said suck my cock .
i ' m a good woman to you , <person> . <person> ' t i always take care of you ? nobody cares for you like me . i ' m a good woman .
yes , i know . you are a good woman . <continued_utterance> then again , you may be the antichrist .
<person> for what ? sight-seeing ?
the photos . <continued_utterance> some good ones .
wha- no .
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser <person> and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .
<person> a settlement , tie us down in negotiations , we come up short .
why else would they approach us in this way ? it ' s deniable . the soviets have done nothing but lie to us . this could be more of the same .
you ' re one sick bastard . a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . i think no matter which way i go i ' m likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . so here ' s my answer : kiss my ass , hop-along . <continued_utterance> not bad for a gimp .
what ' s with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you ' re `` extreme '' ? i ' ve got some news for you , mr . x , you ' re a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x ' s on your head .
she told you about . . .
her dog , yes .
how do you know this ?
we had a seance .
it was unintentional .
<person> reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable . he wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was brains . there was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches . <continued_utterance> it ' s that nut of yours .
oh , but it ' s not . if i hadn ' t been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , i never would have took off for new york . i never would have met <person> , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .
can we just get back to <person> ?
i don ' t know . i just assumed .
why would you assume anything about me ? we just met .
is she for real ? <person> , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
my goodness , a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
because we believed we could make an impact out here . self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing .
i haven ' t forgotten .
yeah .
did you reach your mom ?
talkins good . long as you got the other ? im a big believer in talkin , case you aint noticed .
too bad they dont give an award for talkin . youd win first prize .
is that so ? well , we ' ll see who ' s the goofy one .
you ?
after we get a reading on the storm ?
immediately , <person> .
trinkets for the ladies .
<person> ' s share .
of course .
all i have to do is take one small step at a time and i can do anything !
<person> , <person> . i lost <person> --
-- never mind <person> . we ' ve got <person> nailed . <person> ' s go !
<person> .
<person> , thanks for the directions .
. <person> to apologize . i .
<person> , i ' m the one who should be sorry . i didn ' t want that to happen . oh , <person> ! <person> at you . are you all right .
blow me .
another month in this desert and i might just .
is that good , or bad ?
i don ' t know . they killed wes .
of course .
which is also why i ' ve withheld this information from nato and our allies .
and you ' re just sitting there like that ?
whaddaya mean , sitting there ? i happen to be getting ready to fly this airplane .
<person> ' t ? you ' ve really scared me . is that what you wanted ? is that what you wanted ?
no .
you would lose . you must excuse me .
just one more thing -- is <person> owned by the c . i . a . or the k . g . b . ? i ' ll figure out the rest .
yeah . i ' ve just never needed it . will you talk to my father ?
i ' ve talked to your father .
what do you want , <person> ?
i ' m looking for a man hiker .
but he does not need to buy it .
if it ' s of any comfort to you , i agree .
these damn things are unloaded , ain ' t they ?
it ' s important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire . as <person> and <person> might say , `` we is the outgoing fire . `` come with us , son . we ' ll show you some steaming hot juke joints , steaming hot women .
i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment . the narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now . they want to ask you a few questions .
<person> squad ? what do they want with me ? i don ' t even use aspirin !
well , maybe not that isolated .
aw , there ' s plenty to do in concrete if you kids would take a little initiative . when i was growing up we didn ' t have t . v . -- we used our imaginations . we read the classics . we played musical instruments . you show me a bored kid , i ' ll show you a lazy kid .
no , no -- now don ' t tell me . they -- they don ' t understand you at home . they don ' t appreciate you . you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
why , it ' s just like you could read what was inside of me .
right . <person> , lem me tell you something . with a child you always know who the mother is , but the father -- that ' s another kettle of fish . so don ' t give me that bullshit , okay ?
very well . i won ' t discuss it any further with you . will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are ?
she ' s still a transvestite .
mm .
his lips , unused as they are to such a contortion , twisted and stretched . into a smile .
it was spectacular . and what teeth .
a wedding band ? ? ? what am i supposed to be able to do with this ?
i believe <person> ' s exact words were : `` hopefully , nothing . ``
you ' re damaged goods , lady .
did you tell her about us , <person> ?
um . have you thought at all about what i said ?
of course i ' ve been thinking about it .
how ! ?
we ' ll find our way ! we ' ll .
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again ?
i was just baiting him ! <person> , i had to tell him that to get his guard down . just like you told <person> you was going to kill me !
it ' s her ! i ' m telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she ' s trying to contact me !
it ' s a ghost . <continued_utterance> you took this in the morning , didn ' t you ? she nods slightly . <continued_utterance> when the sun would be exactly right .
do you still love me ?
yes .
what ' s up ?
well . i ' ve got a little more news about your friend <person> . <person> seems relieved .
no . but i mean . just the idea that mr . <person> would .
way i hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys .
me , too .
we ' ll ground her , clip her wings a bit . <person> and scheduled activities and that ' s it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . <person> , in the district attorney ' s office , will probably help us out , quietly . <person> , this could be embarrassing .
oh , <person> !
two vehicles . they ' re not supposed to be here .
irs ? they ' re not gon na leave me alone !
<person> commission .
no --
then we ' ll be keeping the lights on .
that ' s good shit .
now that you have what you want , let ' s talk about how i get what i want .
i ' ve got to move . what do you have , <person> ?
they know each other ! <person> and feklisov aka <person> were war buddies !
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn ' t get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
this is all bullshit .
this is my area of expertise .
what did you do to those people ?
big on the musical comedy , huh ?
sounds like you ve never seen her , <person> .
tell him fine .
andlt ; andlt ; he says that is fine . andgt ; andgt ;
give a guy a break , huh ?
what happened ?
i don ' t think that ' s cruel . it ' s just practical . if everybody was rich , who ' d wait on us ?
good . see that he ' s bathed and dressed , then bring him to me . maya frowns and exits . inanna this should be amusing .
<person> ? try stalkerish .
not if things worked out between us . i would ' ve told you everything eventually , and then it wouldn ' t be stalkerish . it would just be this sweet funny story we ' d have .
you don ' t deserve me , you know .
i know , but sometimes .
indeed . please . <continued_utterance> thanks for your time on a sunday .
where ' s mr . <person> ?
<person> ' t make me kill you .
i believe you would .
why don ' t we just talk about this in a nice , rational manner .
rational ? you ' re going to be rational ?
i ' m trying to bust the tijuana cartel .
what is it you want me to do ?
<person> ' like what ? ! how am i supposed to act ? ' scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody ' s head off !
you could help me try and figure it out ! i got ta figure out what to do , and you could try and help me .
<person> , why are you so hostile towards the poor man ?
because he ' s a patient , <person> ! <person> ' t you get it ?
i heard you talking . i could tell where you were in the room .
i don ' t know what ' s going on anymore . i thought i was square with that dude . now everybody ' s switching sides like it ' s the wwf . <continued_utterance> what are you doing with the ivans ?
<person> , you ' ve stolen , vandalized , trespassed , and burned down <person> . all for one girl . if there ' s a misunderstanding , it ' s with your insight into females .
but . but where did i go wrong ?
you just wouldn ' t . it ' s not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
<person> , i don ' t know what ' s going on or how you got mixed up with him , but don ' t you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around , okay ?
we ' ve gone insane .
yup .
you ' re a helluva translator .
i know . i ' m much in demand around here . will you excuse me ? if you have any questions , just ask .
hey , hey , hey . what are we forgetting ?
what a team . see you at eight .
i see . how exactly ? <continued_utterance> well , i thought i ' d break your neck , then use you as a human shield , then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun . <continued_utterance> and what makes you think you can do all that ?
because i picked the lock on these handcuffs . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t move .
yes .
. sworn before god you would tell the truth ?
a coincidence . <person> ' t you ever heard of a coincidence ?
i ' m a walking coincidence . i can ' t count ' em . no something ' s happening , <person> . i ' ve got to get to the bottom of it .
you have revealed yourself .
oh yeah , i ' m with them .
that could be a fluke , right ?
or not .
you know what that big `` e '' stands for ?
yep . you ' re right . that ' s why i ' m here .
do we have to ?
and i kicked ass . my best stuff . then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition . and i cried .
it ' s about a man on a quest for knowledge who meets a woman he can not resist .
if i discount i have to fire someone because i can ' t discount with this overhead but whom could i fire ? i couldn ' t fire anyone .
no .
i didn ' t think so . <continued_utterance> here . i gave you my assistant ' s phone number . if it ' s urgent , she knows where to reach me .
hiking ?
no .
yes . well . <person> ' t compete with that .
well . i keep bumping into you . hope your mango ' s ripe .
<person> .
my lord , look at the eyes on him -- won ' t he be a heartbreaker in three , four years ?
that sounds like horseshit .

no .
oh . hi , <person> . you scared me .
<person> . <person> ' t mean to sneak up on you .
we want the special . <continued_utterance> did you hear me , chinese waiter ? <continued_utterance> we want the special .

you are a runner . some day you will make eye contact with another runner and --
no one ever even looks at me . they don ' t . on top of which , who are they ? they could like the symphony . i could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony --
you girls are in some hot water .

if you ' re even thinking about leaving me down here , you better think again .
wes , i ' m coming up .
you ' re not leaving here <person> .
then like i said : you only get me .
she spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games . i think she ' d like it best if she never had to show them to anybody .
really ? she doesn ' t enjoy all the adulation ?
actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot --
<person> up , <person> . i wasn ' t really seeking golf tips .
<person> , is that a sand dune .
oh , no .
i beg to differ . we started a fight we never got to finish .
i was kidding about that .
you know what would be really useful ? do you still have that friend at ligo ?
she was more than a friend .
i think i ' ve been . i vaguely recall .
<person> , you ' ve got to forget .
<person> . how much time ?
<number> hours . in <number> hours there can be no deals .
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .
<person> , please . this is out of your hands .
oh yes , thanks -- that ' s really nice of you .
<person> night , <person> .
ah , yeah , hi . is tina there ?

`` would be honored if you place my name in nomination for president . stop . the party needs you . stop .

i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you ' re what i want . the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about <person> . but i ' ve had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we ' ve got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
<person> ?

what is all this ? when are you coming home ?
just a few tokens of my affection .
it ' s not that simple . takes money , planning . you can ' t just up and go . oh , i ' m gon na do it , don ' t worry about that . i just got ta move slow . pick a moment . <person> time ' s just around the corner . soon as i get a retaining wall built on the back of the house i can start thinking about selling up . and i ' ll be gone . up and away on that big steel bird . i ' m going , don ' t you worry about that .
i never knew anybody who got out .
<person> -
there you are - painless .

i tried to call , but apparently there ' s something wrong . <person> leans down , replaces the uncradled phone . sara . with your phone . unfortunately , mine was ringing loud and clear this morning .
oh ?
perhaps if i knew the question .
i ' ve just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my musketeers .
<person> . <person> , everyone is furious about it . we trade away our missiles in turkey and we ' re fucked politically . <continued_utterance> you got ta stop ' em . we know it ' s <person> and <person> ' s idea - they leaked it to <person> . the military guys are going ape , and they ' re not alone .
then they should speak up .
i ' m not giving you a divorce , and that ' s it . i ' m looking out for your welfare . no divorce . <continued_utterance> it ' s for your own benefit , and you ' ll thank me for it .
my benefit ! you don ' t give a damn about me ! you don ' t give a damn who i marry . the reason you don ' t want me to marry is because he ' s the one taking your wife , and you ' ve got your own problems with him .
no ? why not ?
you just wouldn ' t . it ' s not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
<person> , that ' s -- that ' s awfully nice of you . my life . <continued_utterance> . has been simply unbearable .
oh .
what ?
i told him to go to <person> after we ' d left . though he should be flogged for taking so long .
you mutant bastards . <continued_utterance> whatever you do to me . no matter what youandiacute ; ll make me right . every word i have spoken will be confirmed .
<person> , i hope so .
and other uses , no doubt .
abuses in your case . you destroyed my hydro-boat in less than seven minutes , as no doubt will be the case with this . <continued_utterance> <number> , my deputy assistant . i ' m grooming him to follow me .
you ' ve had an exhausting night , why don ' t you .
what is it ?
<person> ' t they gon na wonder were you ' ve been ?

<person> .
i don ' t know , thelma ! i don ' t know ! just shut up a minute so i can think .
<person> ' t we go to the cops ? i mean , i think we should tell the police .

<person> . or <person> ? both - simultaneously .
you can ' t clear the dogleg with a three wood .

any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
i ' m warning you . this is an official warning . <person> , <person> , danger .
<person> for antiques .

after a judge signs it . now leave . <continued_utterance> we wait for him to deliver , then we arrest him . you never saw that agreement .
i ' m sorry , <person> , but dr . <person> just called and instructed me not to put you through .
what ?
kind of a sign , you ' re saying .
in a sense .
i think so .
<person> carefully . you will be lying to the man you love . the person who trusts you the most .
<person> to disturb you guys , but i ' m splitting . i didn ' t come here to be a bedwarmer . ' bye .
no ! <person> , please don ' t go . it ' s all over now , i ' m coming back to bed .

i believe you . i believe you want to be with me . but this is not just about me anymore .
no sir ! i swear ! this is not true ! !
you disappoint me , <person> .
i understand .
we throw away the _whole_ head .
perhaps . perhaps . i ' m afraid i must first ask you to pass a test . i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors . <continued_utterance> take this back with you . deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal .
that ' s crazy . my husband is on trial for smuggling .

<person> , what the fuck are we doing here ?
i want to be here . with you . what do you want .
do you know what the point of a vacation is ? do you understand the meaning of the word ?
sure .
you ' re kidding . <person> ' t you shoot him or something ?
i don ' t really like guns . you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive .
it ' s barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .
well , at least it turned out to have some purpose . <person> gives her a look . <continued_utterance> no-one goes into the field on this unless they ' re <number> % . dr . greatrex is waiting .
<person> ' t you late ?
you know what this is , you know what we ' re seeing here ? we ' re seeing the end of western civilization as we know it .
oh , well , some people have all the luck . everyone in the family is fine here . <person> had the mumps , which is no joke at eleven years of age -
the rest of the letter is about the family . he ' s telling me they have nothing for me , we ' re not fooling each other . thank you . <person> , it couldn ' t be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes . now could it ?
in a fire , as i recall .
started he couldnt remember things ? got real violent ? <person> kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask . but i dont know . seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces .
i don ' t have a cell .
how can you not have a cell ?
so . does your family do the whole traditional christmas thing ?
no , my grandparents are dutch , so i was raised on salted licorice and sinterklaas .
well , it ' s iraq . i ' m not sure , but i ' m guessing that has something to do with them being here .
what are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
it ' s too late .
my god . you ' ve got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . where is she ?
<person> , ma ' am , you don ' t understand ! i
keep your change . <person> three-twenty-three . <person> at seven fifty two , tonight .
<person> -- listen to me . i ' m going home , then i ' m booking a flight to dallas . i ' m getting you a ticket , too .
<person> --
because i hate wearing glasses .
but they look good on you .
if he falls behind by fifteen points it ' s a technical fall . they get five team points . if that happens the score would be tied but we ' d lose the match on criteria .
seriously ?
you ' re telling me the cause of death on the report is false . that this man didn ' t die from an explosion , or from flying debris .
i don ' t know what killed this man . i ' m not sure if anybody else could claim to either .
yeah . do you want it back ?
no .
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes <number> % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .
<person> brought up divorce statistics .
i can hear it , grandpre , and there is no wind . you shouldn ' t lie to me .
here . there is no wind here . but over there - a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground .
bummer . your noon canceled so you just have a <number> : <number> and <number> pm .
ok . anything else ?
have you told <person> ?
not yet . i don ' t want to freak her out .
<person> . then you ' re not her grandmother .
raised her like she was , but no , <person> ' s my only child . he was a good boy , till the army took him . <person> looks once more at the old photograph .
where are they ? where did they go ?
thanks for your help , <person> .
it won ' t work .
why not ? !
what ' re you talking about ? you ain ' t got a pot to piss in .
give me the pot . i ' ll fill it .
i ' m leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
this means something to you ? <person> means something to me .
i know . i kept walkin , i headed for your house , only it wasn't your house , really . you let me in only you werent real pleased to see me . you kept askin , whyd you come to see me now ? why now ? like itd been a long time since wed seen each ohter .
oh , baby , what an idea . id always be happy to see you , no matter what .
. then buy yourself a decent bowling jacket so when you take <person> out you don ' t look like the roto rooter man . come on , for godsakes , that ' s what money ' s for . enjoy yourself .
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you ' re never happy ' cause somebody ' s always trying to take it away from you . <person> ' s one giant pain in the ass y ' ask me . thanks .
i thought i was the <person> .

i ' d go with you and lean against the door . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got a pretty good aim .
i sure do .
<person> ?
yeah , <person> ! you can tell her she ' s got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps !
justice . <person> . <person> .
why ?
they wouldn ' t do it in front of all these people . they ' d send someone later , when we ' re alone . <continued_utterance> away from the car . now !
even if that were true , they ' re not going to come to your house where you ' re waiting for them .
i ' m having fun , what ' s the problem ?
you have all this talent , and you waste it . you won ' t take a single endorsement deal . meanwhile those other guys have their own video games ! but no , you ' ve got too much `` integrity '' for that .
<person> , that was a little weird -
but that ' s how it works with parties . you have to be invited .
he left out the window .
i ' m really sorry about this .

. but we don ' t tend to focus on that aspect of it , right off the bat --
why not ?
i ' m well .
how ' d you get my cell number ?
lay off the bennies , <person> .
anybody can clean the surface of an object , but dirt can find its way anywhere . to really clean , you have to scrub below the surface .
everything is a nightmare --
you cried out for `` <person> , '' <person> .
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you ' re talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ?
he loved her .
that was all fenster and mcmanus .
come on . <person> was a cop for four years . who else would know the taxi service
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up . i asked him not to tell . i didn ' t think he would tell anybody .
why not ? ! what ' s he got to lose ? other than my life ' s savings , that is . <person> !
i ' m scared , that ' s what . i ' m scared there ' s no one to trust .
you can trust me .
maybe .
<person> is real . he ' s been `` having '' me since i was <number> . <person> , <person> doesn ' t know what to do . laura the diary was hidden too well . he ' s the only one who could know where it was . he ' s getting to know me , now . he ' s real he speaks to me .

eternal recurrence . maybe it wouldn ' t be so bad .
what wouldn ' t ?
-- charming .
i was not charming .

yeah . it ' s already been hit .
not hungry .
<person> ! please . <person> ' t walk away from me .
well -- brian ? i understand what you ' re saying , and i think it ' s great . i do . because there ' s a lot of things around here that could use some attention . believe me . but i ' ve honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes , and if i take the time out of my lunch hour .
i ' d really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement . ok ?
<number> hours . they ' ve already sailed from the persian gulf .
i expect to have that gold recovered in <number> hours . until then , i ' m imposing my own electronic silence : for the sake of the economy , not a word to nato , the press , the cia . . and so long as commander bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters , i want him to go along as an observer . are we agreed ?
i don ' t know . perhaps i remember something .
we have the ability to change the color , odor , and physical property of cocaine .
i got this guy who should know tells me buy <person> but i been burned on tips . what do you think <person> ?
let ' s see , it closed at uh , <number> <continued_utterance> rising profits . strong balance sheets , good earnings per share .

<person> ' t push too fast ! <person> ! the hard part is over . you can see the top of the head .
it hurts . the pain . it ' s tearing me .

i made it this far ! i just got to hold it together for <number> more
i don ' t know what you mean .
i mean , did you ask her ? what kind of drugs has she tried ?

and we ' re worried that it ' s too intellectual , too complex , too weird , too artsy . that argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans . she hates to be rejected in the flesh , so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat .
<number> i ' ve heard that she ' s very sensitive . <continued_utterance> what are they doing ?

<person> , <person> .
well , little fella , let me put it this way . the operative word here would be `` federal '' . with or without the semantics of all this , i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning <person> , both while living and deceased .
a basic kill . <person> was a drifter and nobody knew her . my boys have been all over this . it ' s a dead end .

i know you didn ' t .
that ' s your way , not mine .
that ' s <person> ' s way !
you want to stick around here , <person> ?

your majesty , france is on the brink of war . we dare not hesitate .
but these men are my personal guards .
i will not . <continued_utterance> maybe you ' re right . maybe i ' m losing my mind .
<person> , please .
i wish <person> was here . i ain ' t cut out to do this . i ' m a spectator by nature . an observer .
<person> up and hand me the big dog .
<person> . what are you doing ? what the hell were you doing out there ? <continued_utterance> this was a selective operations <person> , <person> . there is classified information pertaining to our national security . you don ' t question that , you don ' t go digging into that shit -- that ' s insubordination . <person> --

oh shit , what ' s today ?
today is tuesday . what ?
you ' re welcome .
my men are dead , and i have no casket . you are a deceiver .
<person> ' s right . there ' s not enough time to finish plowing . we ' ll lose everything and i ' ll end up working in the mines .
<person> , do you think we should take her to the village council ?
about anybody but yourself . you never have .
and you ' re a little fucking reject .
i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it .
`` out of weariness , i spoke to my own heart ; to leave it all and to die . and i gave my heart to know madness and folly . ``
let ' s look at it this way , what if i can sell you this job at a wholesale price . kind of lessens the burden . the big boss won ' t get so angry , and maybe won ' t throw the guy ' s wife and kids out . at least they ' ll have a roof over their heads .
what kind of wholesale price are we talking about ?
a bioport , now , that ' s a sort of a hole in your spine , isn ' t it ? lotta assholes `round here , but that ' s generally it . i don ' t know why you ' d be talking to me about that , lady .
sure you do .
but i have proof ! you ran out of here so fast , i didn ' t get to show you .

it ' s too politicized with you in there , anyway . they need to be able to stick their necks out .
if i ' m right , their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night ' s event .
meaning ?
<person> . it was stupid . you could have killed yourself .
<person> . everything just got messed up after that .
i have another appointment at one .
you ' ll miss it , i ' m afraid .
for what purpose ?
yes -- only thereandiacute ; s a problem . the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother
do they come in dreams , these visions ?
oh yeah . <person> . sometimes durin ' sickness . vision quest . <person> . ya never know when .
i don ' t think they ' re too big -- they ' re ultra-absorbent . that ' s all . the more absorbent the better .

<person> ' t anyone age in this land of yours ? <continued_utterance> what ' s your name ?
weena .
<person> . i was making time with your girl . now i ' m scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?

then go away , you bastard .
you fucked a prostitute ?
no <person> did . it was an accident .
<person> .

then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot .
what are we going to do now ?
no -- i ' m leavin ' tomorrow .
well -- what time ?
well , i --
what about the heart that you promised <person> -- ?
that ' s probably not the problem , then . what about your lifestyle . any major changes recently ?
i ' ve been trying to finish a book .
<person> , and there ' s no business as expensive . i ' m twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it ' s all because that rabbit can ' t keep his mind on his work .
one too many safes dropped on his head ?
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay ?
the skinny brunette .
we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we ' re out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .
what if it hadn ' t been wes ? what if . i mean , accidentally , what if i had .
how about we just stop talking altogether .
that ' s perfect . <person> now that i ' m not some nietzche-spouting sexbot , suddenly i ' m not worth knowing . and who ' s fault is that ?
ms . <person> , did <person> rape you in your family ' s home on the <number> rd of april last year ? suzie glances at sam , hesitates . <continued_utterance> ms . <person> ?
i said he did .
oh , no !
what a lovely hat , mrs . <person> . it goes quite well with your head .
<person> . <person> , that ' ll work .
if you ' re even thinking about leaving me down here , you better think again .
i ' m not changing the rules .
i haven ' t asked you to .
little young for that , aren ' t you ? <continued_utterance> what shall i make you ?
anything ' ll do .
sure . would you like something for sleep ?
what ?
sometimes i wonder .

the sea .
you can ' t help them now . your job is to survive . she struggles to sit up .
no ! i will die a warrior ' s death . stories will be told of this day -- he gently takes her shield from her .
you know <person> ' s doing really well with wrestling here , <person> . the regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states .
that ' s great .
what ' s to see ?
what happened to the room ?
and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
i hope to . we ' re working to develop this evidence --
and who might that be ? <person> ? <person> ?
<person> , wow . i was afraid you left . i was afraid i ' d never see you again .
woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . she called the police and they came over and arrested me . thought i was a sniper ! boys at the vfw loved that one . <person> didn't understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . i was gon na put out poison , but i was afraid somebodys cat would eat it . <person> , i had six cats myself . so i used the . <number> because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap .
what happened on the charges ?
that ' s a lie !
tell me about lies !
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he didn ' t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .
your father .
why what ?
why does he belong with us ?
is <person> in ?
no sir he is not . i read about you in the paper .
give it back to her mother , that ' s what .
but it says she went to europe .

yeah .
the chancellor ' s here ? now ?
evidently . coming !
<person> ' t i get a hello ?
hello , gillian .
<person> , if this is an emergency , go to the emergency room . if not , call dr . <person> and i ' m sure he can help you .
i ' d feel better if i just knew where you were . it ' s <person> ' s <person> right ?
you cold , <person> ?
a little .
yes . yes i am . that ' s exactly what i ' m going to do . why not ?
but she wrote the letters .
i didn ' t ask him to come ! it ' s like i said , thelma , he just loves the chase .
well boy , he ' s got his work cut out for him now , don ' t he ?
you one of them new age assholes ?
just a soul on a personal journey . what i ' ve realized is that i ' m capable of anything . i have to start expanding my horizons .
<person> advice for a shopkeeper . let alone a king .
your eminence , i ' m sorry that i was sharp with you . it ' s just that the musketeers . well , they ' re not just my guards . they ' re my friends too .
i don ' t know .
that ' s right .
y ' hear anything you ' ll let me know ?
of course . <continued_utterance> what was her major ?
why ' d you jump ?
because i felt like it . what do you care ?
then i ' ll write about you .
me ?
well , honey , just grab some other toy ! now c ' mon !
<person> .
i just think about things as they come up . i never been much of a planner .
it aint altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes . <person> , i done a few things in my life i aint too proud of , but <person> tell ya from now on i aint gon na do nothin for no good reason . all i know for sure is theres moren a few bad ideas runnin around loose out there .
maybe i ' ve been mistaken for somebody else . <continued_utterance> a guy with the same name as me in time magazine . it ain ' t a common name so i looked out for it . but the day it came out , every newstand was sold out . no library had it . i even wrote off for a back-issue . never seen a copy to this day . <continued_utterance> maybe i ' m being set up for something . you ever feel like that , <person> ? like your whole life has been building to something ?
a coincidence . <person> ' t you ever heard of a coincidence ?
i can , <person> . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --
we ' re close to something here -- we ' re on the verge --
probably right . <continued_utterance> macready and i were listening to some of these cassettes on the way back . like you gentlemen to hear it .
what do you want from us ?
now , we agreed to let them finish their show first .
i didn ' t agree ! that was his idea !
countess , i ' m very grateful for what you ' ve done , but i can ' t stay here . i ' ve got .
what . ?
well , sometimes you ' ll eat more than he does , and it ' ll even out .
no way ! he ' s a pig ! he always eats more than anyone else . why should i pay for his food ?
but , sir .
with him . . on the lose , i ' m not taking any more chances . <person> will flush him out .
no ! <person> ' t shoot ! he ' s hiding behind the nerve agent !
goddamit ! he ' s gon na stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable !
the con . ! oh my god .
just keep looking at that beautiful sky .
you ' re marrying again .
yes .
she wants to see you -- now .
i hope you don ' t think i ' m interested in her .
. and is dumber than my hind end . like that <person> .
<person> .
hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem .
yes , i hope so as well .
you ' re suppose to teach your children what you know . <person> , i don ' t have to worry about . <person> is a different story .
you still call him boy . you call <person> boy in front of his wife and son .
you are a good detective .
i do my best . <continued_utterance> <person> for the inconvenience . <person> your stay .
that ' s what i heard .
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this . and no one had a machine like this .
they will believe . they will all believe . <continued_utterance> you understand ? nobody can resist me . <continued_utterance> know what happens when a man is strangled ?
elektra , it ' s not too late . eight million people needn ' t die .
he seemed pretty upset this morning .
he ' s nervous about the interview .
well , now he saw me . now you saw me . ok ? now would you mind ?
man , you are really --
then what do they have ?
they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .
uh , sure . <person> .
i have only one concern . <continued_utterance> you do like girls , don ' t you ?
i decided to let <person> run the magazine . i need to go to college , learn a few things , you know . <continued_utterance> and i thought maybe i ' d take up boating . i ' ve always wanted to be a `` coxswain . ``
very ambitious . i like that .
i ' d do it again .
you two have , of course , just served me up your balls -- if that ' s what they ' re called -- on a platter . i can bury you both . you ' re handing me your careers . <continued_utterance> well , <person> . this is a motherfucking story , russell . what am i supposed to do with it ?
we were suite mates .
and there ' s this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish .
you ' re not going to believe this -- i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story . . exclusive . eat your heart out .
what ' d ya get ?
mother ! no ! !
you made your decision ! <continued_utterance> begin the ritual . now ! light the first candle . <continued_utterance> come , thunder . come lightning . touch this altar with your pwer . come into my tower . <continued_utterance> dark runes , dark powers ! <person> and bind , bind and blend , universal night ! and the might of nockmaar !
still not getting it .
i said , ' i don ' t think so . '
it ' s not bad .
<person> , <person> , about this afternoon . in
where were you just now ? what were you doing ?
i was wandering through existenz - the new system , i mean . i like it in there . of course , without another player you ' re only a tourist . it ' s frustrating .
some weather we ' re having .
<person> , it ' s really coming down . so what do you say ? how `bout a little christmas spirit here ?
got the touch ?
yeah . still moldable , too .
now that ' s very flattering . tuna coming up . let me make you some warm milk . that ' ll help the insomnia .
no it won ' t . warm milk won ' t do it .
me ?
well , it ' s -- it ' s someone she loves very much . someone she ' s been very kind to . someone she ' s taken care of in sickness .
did you know her ?
i may have seen her on campus .
and you ' re going to help me by reading my mind ?
indubitably . there is only small matter of a fee .
you admit you ' re lying ?
i admit i don ' t know where he is .
the federal building was too well guarded .
no . they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices . the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there . <person> is where the bodies were found . but that ' s the thing . <continued_utterance> . the thing you didn ' t know . that you ' d never think to check . <continued_utterance> those people were already dead .
you don ' t believe in anything do you , <person> ?
i believe in this moment , that ' s all . there is nothing else . come on . he must weigh <number> pounds .
<person> ' t worry about it . you ever wrestle before ?
yeah .
<person> , i ' ll tell you something that is the god ' s honest truth . i ' ve seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .
that ' s hard to believe .
things do get kinda confused these days , don ' t they ? i ' m gon na go wash up . you two make yourselves at home .
what are you doing ?
what ?
i just wanted to get home to my babies .
call him . <person> ' t tell him anything . tell him you ' re having a wonderful time and you ' ll be home tomorrow night .
will i be ?
work with me -- i ' m just speculating here . <person> ' s call this force `` <person> '' ; and let ' s say this `` <person> '' is controlling everything . <person> wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil .
why would he want that ?
that ' s not the question . it ' s over . do you think that it ' s my fault ? if i ' d . if i ' d . i never should have taken it . there was no way that i was going to win .
you ' re talking like a drunk .
<person> . <person> page .
' find out who you are and do it on purpose . ' <person> .
you take good care of him .
we will .
there ' s no apology necessary .
how do i look ?
do you know it ?
<person> ' t think so .
hey , <person> .
hey .
they ' re pretty pissed off . they ' ll do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they won ' t let me in without you .
three million ?
i ' ve been a cop for a while , <person> . it ' s hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . and then there ' s the love angle . i mean do you and <person> really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ? <continued_utterance> am i right , did <person> sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking <person> ? that ' s murder , <person> .
police -- god -- get a life .
i could break you , mate , in two pieces over my knees , you know it , i know it , i could buy you six times ever , i could dump the stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares . i ' m announcing a tender offer at <number> tomorrow , and i ' m expecting your commitment .
showdowns bore me <person> , neither side wins . you can have the company , in fact it ' s gon na be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it . what do you think is a fair price for our stock <person> ?
hey , <person> . <person> , i ' ll take care of him . go ahead in , grab some coffee . we ' ll be back pretty quick .
you sure ?
<person> about moving .
as long as i ' m in my apartment , i ' m okay . i have a phone job -- selling dental supplies -- and that ' s fine . but when i have to go out , i get . , weird .
an anonymous caller ?
that ' s right .
there is no point . you live . you die . the end .
maybe we ' re not supposed to understand , but we ' re supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture .
and if the teeth aren ' t <person> ' s ? you ' ll give this up ?
if i ' m wrong about those teeth -- it ' s a promise .
you think ?
yeah , that ' s exactly what i think . you and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes . <person> ' s get out of here . we got sand to protect .
all right . see this animal . this here ' s the stupidest goddamn animal on the face of god ' s good earth . here ' s your bull hook . you ' re gon na need it .
i don ' t believe it . the mayor said she was the best bull you had .
in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?
<person> died .
no more ' n you are for that doctor lady .
<person> , <person> , just great . just when i need you to be my friend and coach , you go get all gooey about one of my ex-girlfriends who just happens to be our boss .
that would indicate that it ' s the future .
the later events have never been kept a secret .
anywhere in this circle . iran , iraq , pakistan , syria , afghanistan .
<person> .
a low rumble freezes grady
okay . <person> now . eee-zy . . . . <continued_utterance> <person> ! <continued_utterance> get off of me , you son-of-a-bitch !
i called <person> at princeton . he ' s sending me applications for prep schools . i need you to take me to seattle to take some entrance exams .
would a prep school take you with , uh , your school record ?
oh --
but you couldn ' t have been , could you ?
that ' s great .
yeah . it is and it could be really good for him . it might even mean a scholarship . <person> , i was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until that ' s all over .
i just want to know why you told me not to move , and you ran .
because i honestly thought he ' d go for me . i thought i was doing you a favor . apparently not appreciated .
by what right do you interfere ?
what do you think ?
<person> .
when am i going to see you ?
how did i get in the house ? how did i get into my bed ?
i can ' t help you there .
when <person> was dumped out there in the badlands , he was dropped on his back . our man made an effort to turn him over , onto his face . it ' s an old ind ' n belief that if a dead man is turned face down , his spirit won ' t leave . and in the killer ' s case , it won ' t come back and jump all over his shit . that ' s an ind ' n thing a white man wouldn ' t know . <continued_utterance> and that ' s the way it is . write it down . <continued_utterance> you laugh all you want , <person> . <person> tonight , i get my man .
<person> , <person> . i ' m listening . i ' m listening to the trees , to the stones . who is it ?
i know you ' re not .
i ' ll call you tonight .
the canadian prime minister wants to set a lunch -
pencil it in for the next trip -
damn right i ' m done . i ' m going to ask for a mistrial and i ' m going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . i ' m going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass .
you aren ' t going to get a mistrial , boy . we ' re going back this afternoon , we ' re going to try this case to an end . now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail .
four dollars . i want to pay four dollars a month .
that ' s not an honest answer .
because i ' m a cop with a law degree , and you thought my legal-
-because your a thug with a law degree . because i thought by now you ' d be so indebted to this department for not indicting and/or imprisoning you , that diligent , honest discharge of duty would be assured . and i made a horrible misjudgment .
well , you ' ve already refinanced twice .
because you advised us to do that .
whose side are you arguing . ? i thought that you wanted to do something . i don ' t have any interest in the woman ' s ' estate ' -- no offense , but we all know where the money ' s going to . i have an interest in the hospital ; and i don ' t want those bozos working in the same shop as me . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . they turned the girl into a vegetable . they killed her and they killed her kid . you caught ' em . now : how many others did they kill ? a beat . gruber discards end of a cigar . takes a leather case from his suede jacket , extracts a new cigar . offers one to galvin . <continued_utterance> you want a cigar ?
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of .
this is why we split up -- he always went for it .
my problem is i ' ve never been with
all right , i owe you one marv .
that ' s right , next time a little birdie talks to you , talk to me too e . f . <person> .
of course not . i don ' t even know him .
i mean cybersex .
not if there was just one day left on it .
why ?
countess ?
my husband ' s dead .
we all got a secret side , baby . hope you dont think i been lyin to you bout other things , sugar .
howd you know my daddy ?
why are you saying this ?
it ' s all right . no one can hear . we ' ll never get another chance to say it all . <continued_utterance> nothing can ever happen with us , you know . it ' s too dangerous . august will never let me go . you don ' t know what he ' s capable of .
how did ya know ?
you mean to make up my mind to marry her ?
are you ?
yeah .
i mean ask for it . nicely .
i meant no disrespect .
your parents are divorced ?
since i was five . my mom ' s a cocktail waitress .
you may kiss the bride .
you fucking people are fucking sick !
dinner . with <person> and his new girl .
when ?
<person> ' s telling everyone that kiss was real .
it was .
but you still operate a gas station , don ' t you ?
only on the most pathetic level of reality . <person> ' s work liberated me .
yeah , i heard a key slapping against my ass .
there ' s someone in the house . grace <continued_utterance> relax baby . <person> here .
you murder people .
`` murder '' is a word for criminals . i have a job to protect the stability of a continent .
every hour . every minute . i wish he was here . i wish he could have sailed our girl . seen these boys . <continued_utterance> i ' d have liked to have said goodbye .
he knows .
sometimes there is only one right choice , and you thank god when it ' s clear .
you ' re talking about a sneak attack ! how ' ll that make us look ? big country blasting a little one into the stone age . we ' ll be real favorites around the world .
are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it ' s every red-blooded , heterosexual male ' s dream .
i never figured you for a pimp .
i ' m sorry , i can ' t .
you can trust me completely .
yeah , yeah i . <person> , thanks . cheers . cheers . <continued_utterance> thanks .
that . that ' s a very long strand . when you cut it , it ' s going to release this -
my . eyes . <continued_utterance> . they ' re burning .
<person> , how much did you smoke ?
of course not . have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? no you ain ' t . you have to take just one and fatten him up . when you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . if you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . you just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste . <continued_utterance> you just take one ; you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground .
i don ' t know if we could take one in with <person> and me at home alone at times .
please be nice .
all right .
mcmasters , isn ' t it ? <person> , you seen a black stallion with-
<person> , i got a rule . i don ' t talk to lawmen . dog-catchers neither .
<person> ' animals . hey , what do you say we go grab a couple drinks .

mr . price . the world is not divided into east and west anymore . it is divided into north and south . by the time you people figure that out -- it will be too late . congratulations on your cover .
why do you say that ?
we ' re supposed to write a story for english homework , but they didn ' t tell us what it ' s supposed to be about .
lets get a sandwich and find out about some work .
<person> ?
very funny . no , this buys you time .
what about <person> ?
he ' s the most interesting man i ' ve ever known . when i first met him , i wasn ' t expecting that . he took me by surprise . <continued_utterance> if i ' d been prepared , i might not have loved him . but i wasn ' t . so i did .
i don ' t regret it , you know .
<person> , sure . you go ahead . melt him with your scary laser .
be careful with that , it ' s extremely dangerous .
<person> .
<person> . someone stole my car . i parked it right there last night .
i ' m not rambling .

i don ' t know . <person> , i love you . i wish i could say it in a more interesting way . i just -- i love you .

okay , it ' s <person> ' s father . so what ?
so why would <person> want to help my father move to <person> ?

lot of good it does me !
four men , maybe five . and a child -- or a small women maybe .
<person> .
but honey , i thought you told me your uncle <person> raped you when you was thirteen .
thats true . uncle <person> wasn't really an uncle . he was a business partner of my daddys ? and my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure . his real name was somethin kind of european , like <person> . but everyone just called him <person> . he came around the house sometimes when <person> was away . i always figured he was sweet on mama , so when he cornered me one afternoon , i was surprised moren a little .
actually , its the most god-awful martini i ' ve ever tasted .
are you always this direct , <person> ?
how the hell should i know ? ! independent operator . <person> , can we continue this conversation in the car , `cause i ' m freezing my balls off standing out here .
i ' m not getting into the car with you , you psycho ! ! !
he just broke your truce ! we must act !

you don ' t need to be helped any longer . you ' ve always had the power to go back to kansas .
i have ?
what ?
that we ' re going back . i don ' t want it to end . i don ' t want to be what i was when i left .
thelma , please get a hold of yourself . you ' re making a spectacle .
you know , <person> , you ' re supposed to be my best friend . you could at least be a little bit happy for me . you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isn ' t completely disgusting .
where did you get this ?
the man gave it to me .
no , thank you .
we need more champagne .
one thing puzzles my mind , sugar . youre twenty years old - arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart ? puttin a detective on us . <person> tell ya <person> . well . its moren me killin <person> .
maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much .
so they see your house , and another one done with aluminum siding . the other house looking so much more beautiful .
in <person> ?
to what ? you looking for him ?

and then that ' s it -- you get only an hour of sleep .
and the babysitters till three a . m . -- all my money is sucked
i cant take no more of this radio . i aint never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life , <person> , you find me some dancin music right this minute . i mean it ! ! <continued_utterance> the worlds gettin worse , i think , sailor . and it dont sound like theres much we can do about it , neither .
this aint news , sweetheart . i hate to tell ya .
nope .
wan na fool around ?
i cut my hand .
let me take a look at it . <continued_utterance> are you all together ?
try feeling with your finger .
i can ' t feel anything -- i ' ll give her the stuff for newborns and hope she ' s not allergic to it . <continued_utterance> and then we ' ll have to see if she ' s allergic to iron , to soy or to milk -- you can ' t imagine how much stuff they can be allergic to !
ah , i see . a purely . plutonic relationship . <continued_utterance> really <person> , couldn ' t you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?
what ' s your business with <person> ?
<person> , sure . you got change ?
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ?
hey !
that ' s the sweat of a man who hasn ' t an honest bone in his body . <person> ' t be offended , lad . a man who ' s got no ethics is a free man . i envy that . <person> , how can i blame you ? that <person> sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , don ' t she ? eh ? jake nudges <person> who smiles a nervous smile . <continued_utterance> she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don ' t think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ?
you got a lawyer ?
nah . i already testified once . i beat ' em before , i ' ll beat ' em again . you got a high-priced mouthpiece to speak for ya ?
i broke my clubs -- don ' t ask why , my caddie ' s pissed off at me , i lost my wheels in a sucker bet , and my shrink thinks i ' m a fool -- ' cause i probably am .
you ' re seeing a therapist ? !
<person> .
we have a renew-your-subscription offer .
what ' s going on ?
everything ' s fine , <person> .
i ' ve been tellin ' you that for the last ten years .
do you think <person> ' s having an affair ?
<person> ' <person> , i like you . i could use a capable young man like you in my guards .
i ' m honored , <person> , but i don ' t think i would be very popular with the other men . not after today .
that was really convincing .
well . i think after this is over you should seriously consider moving back home .
i understand .
and the girl i love , she hates `` heaven . `` if i keep it , she ' ll never respect me .
who did it ?
friend of mine , owns a club . <person> . you ' d know him if you saw him . his brother was in your class . <person> .
no , hes out changin the oil in the car .
<person> , i got ta take a piss bad . can i use your head there ?
the great porthos . me , you idiot . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you know who i am ?
the world ' s greatest talker ?
you ' re going to think i ' m crazy or something .
not this week .
this isn ' t real . the judge told <person> he had to live there .
no , honey . this is official from the court . it ' s what <person> said . <continued_utterance> he gets paid for being <person> ' s guardian , <person> . and then he just put him in that place so he didn ' t have to worry about him . <continued_utterance> <person> belongs with us , <person> .
we don ' t think so . i mean , we just want the singing when i come out .
<person> great . what will that be ?
<person> luck .
what did you say ?
<person> . i can ' t give out that number .
but you could call him and ask him to call me .
i understand .
. the case with anyone . and i ' ll meet you tuesday , and we ' ll go over your testimony .
i want to know why they --
the casket of ancient winters belonged to the jotuns . they believe it ' s their birthright .
a woman .
what color hair will she have ?
i think you know , <person> , that your behavior is entirely inappropriate . we talked about trust . we talked about my needs . i want you to get on a bus and go back to new york .
you ' re angry .
of course i do , august . you ' ve been nothing but swell to me .
<person> man ! <continued_utterance> i could truly use a friend i can trust .
yeah -- i don ' t know . i mean --
<person> , you can ' t just leave like this . i --
ninety-six .
congratulations .
it ' s a ghost . <continued_utterance> you took this in the morning , didn ' t you ? she nods slightly . <continued_utterance> when the sun would be exactly right .
then why isn ' t it in any of the other pictures ?
the great escape ! but i got lost .
i should call the home , let them know where you are .
no , you don ' t see . there are three of us sharing this place .
oh , three , huh ? a regular ' mirage a trois ' !
i was forced to hire a caddy for my loose change .
fore . !
they keep him confined ? that ' s bullshit !
that ' s what i said , so i went out and got him a leash you know , one of those clothesline runners for the backyard . he ' s got plenty of room out there to dig . the kid ' s really blossomed . now i can take him to ball games , movies -- you know , happy stuff .
tide and current charts . work backward from the body - find where the ship sank . where did you get the boat ?
seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of bangkok . should have seen his rose garden : blooms the size of hand grenades .
really ? you want me to slap your face ? get you psyched up for the call ?
no . i really don ' t . <continued_utterance> look , we ' re all concerned with what ' s best for <person> so i ' m hoping we can settle this in an amicable way .
. we told them we didn ' t want it to come out this way .
i completely understand .
you ' re not gon na catch him . he can shape-shift into different animals . bear . elk . <person> .
is that like an hereditary thing , <person> , or can one take classes ?
of course you will .
i ' m just saying , you ' re going to be fine .
andlt ; andlt ; it is longer than that . and not so dark . andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; are you sure ? andgt ; andgt ;
the one with the horses .
that ' s me .
i ' ve been dancing with her ! that ' s more important ! the baby ' ll be named after me !
the hiring was more important ! after me !
oh , okay , then i can take this kind .
it ' s got iron in it .
nothing ?
nothing . because the only alternative open to them is one they can ' t choose .
<person> .
explain it . i told you .
how old are you ?
eighteen . well , i ' m gon na be eighteen in two years , but that don ' t mean you can ' t take me for a ride if you want .
when he looks at you , do you forget how to breathe ?
i hope he will someday . i hope i will too .
well i think you ' re right , i should look her up .
<person> ? are you nuts ?
i haven ' t got it yet .
nice night .
but not the timing of the matter . i intended to address them myself , explain the situation .
your majesty , france is on the brink of war . we dare not hesitate .
i ' m better-looking in low light , i didn ' t want to blow it for myself . <continued_utterance> stay by the phone .
i miss you .
yeah .
you got a lawyer ?
-lieutenant dave why you arrest-
-for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps . <person> up . if i was gon na arrest you , i wouldn ' t have let you finish : and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special . <person> ' s in custody . but you could be our guest . whaddya say ?
<person> , see ya .
<person> , babe .
right ? ! <person> , was it right for you to sic <person> on us ? how could you do that ?
did you run into <person> in new orleans ? <person> , are you in new orleans ?
have you got a badge ?
i ' ll show you a badge when you open the goddamn door ! <continued_utterance> i don ' t carry a badge . i ' m issued a license , a piece of paper , and i left it at home . you ' re <person> ? <continued_utterance> can we sit down ? <continued_utterance> do you recognize this man ?
i . r . s . fucking bandits ! bandits ! thieving sons of bitches !
you need a ride uptown ?
<person> .
<person> ! <person> whore ! get away from me !
is there anything you want to ask me , about your father ?
oh , that wasn ' t my father .
<person> ' t give up on me now , <person> .
they ' ll never stop .
you know , this is as much your fault as it is mine .
<person> , we don ' t have time for this -
that would be the reason . <person> . he thinks she might be going for this . <continued_utterance> so it ' s like you want to be secret friends .
that ' s it ! exactly ! you ' re reading my mind --
when you leave this office , don ' t think about everything you have to do to get out of the building , just deal with getting out of the room . when you reach the hall , just deal with the hall . and so forth . <person> steps .
<person> step . through the office . <continued_utterance> <person> step . out the door . <continued_utterance> it works !
tax dollars only cover that much .
are you graduating ?
what kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing ?
i ' m not always a nice guy , i admit that . i got a lot of training in deceit . it ' s an occupational hazard .
to where ?
sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we ' ll know we ' re heading towards saudi arabia . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
help me get out of here .
<person> to .
you ' d die for fun ?
<person> ' t you ? you ' re laughing ! i was sure you never laughed .
i ' m not sure my new husband shares your opinion .
nonsense . he ' s young , not blind .
<person> .
<person> , the important thing is to relax . you ' re safe where you are . we ' ve got patrolmen cruising the area all night long . just stay calm . will you do that for me ?
and still not a thing to watch . <continued_utterance> . although it must be fun to have all those satellites .
they ' re merely tools to disseminate information .
she threw up in her mask , yes . but she hadn ' t eaten one hour prior to admission .
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anesthetic . the type you gave her . would have been negligent . ?
. he ' s a good man .
. he ' s a good man . ? he ' s the prince of <person> ' darkness . he ' ll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her tuesday on a surfboard at hyannis . don ' t fuck with this case .
like you don ' t know .
mad like a dog in heat , i bet you were . i can tell you got a temper on you . <person> gives a little laugh . <continued_utterance> bet you just wanted to snap her neck right then , didn ' t you ? bet you just wanted to kill her . <continued_utterance> would you ?
then close your eyes , and tap your heels together three times . <continued_utterance> and think to yourself -- `` there ' s no place like home ; there ' s no place like home ; there ' s no place like home . ``
there ' s no place like home . there ' s no place like home . there ' s no place like home . there ' s no place like home .
he ' s alright .
how do i know that ? how about it , pretzel-man ? what ' s your story ?
<person> here . <continued_utterance> remember that day me and <person> raced you in your car ?
i remember you somersaulting through the air .
first i see if <person> will let me borrow her car .
it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas .
um , hi , i ' m <person> . i ' m here to take <person> to the prom .
prom ? you ' re about twenty minutes late . she just left for the prom with her boyfriend <person> .
as queen , my mind touches on many subjects .
do your knees feel as weak as water ?
<person> ? you ' re impertinent , rude , sarcastic .
and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like i ' m <person> of sunnybrook farm .
she ' s fine . <person> ' t be better . playing footsie with <person> .
that ' s nice .
my god .
<person> would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn ' t have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .
the hell i don ' t .
you have acquaintances -- business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
g ' damn , price . kudos on the african snaps . <person> , <person> , i haven ' t seen you since .
three <person> .
the report king bought . it ' s a manual . <person> ' s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead .
then <person> was right about a russian connection .
<person> , which kid is yours anyway ?
none of them . he quit .
only by two weeks .
<person> even then ? like he couldn ' t wait to get started ?
just as you are , <person> .
are you board-certified in anesthesiology , <person> ?
no . not this time . this is the case that makes up for a whole career . if you can ' t understand it now , you will in a few years .
what part does money play in all this ? play straight with me .
you didn ' t break my windows ? ! you didn ' t break my windows ? !
push me one more time and i ' m gon na have to redefine your face .
<person> ' t tell me . not the slightest difference ? birdie can ' t bring herself to answer . kathleen how could that be ? all this publicity and not one bit of difference ? oh birdie , what am i going to do ? what would mom have done ?
let ' s ask her . <continued_utterance> cecilia , what should we do ?
she could be a real dog .
i know . <person> , i ' ll just stay ten minutes . i ' ll say hello . drink a cup of coffee and split . i ' m outta here . he looks at kevin . joe walk me there , okay ?
<person> . it ' s me , <person> .
<person> ? <person> , what happened ?
if that ' s where you wish to die , i won ' t disappoint you . <person> then .
three duels in one day . i love this town .
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his <person> .
everyone has to follow his own plough . a man doesn ' t have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . city people don ' t give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . you don ' t plant old ways . . but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you . it ' s when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don ' t want it . you sell it to a stranger . you worked your whole life , for what ? i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm . all what we ' ve experienced has no meaning .
yes . but that ' s not why i called .
<person> ?
i said his heart , not his attention .
three weeks before midterm elections ? you need me .
i ' m just saying i bet those checks all found the mailboxes .
i wouldn ' t know .
arnie . he ' s not going to be able to make the barbecue .
come downstairs . everyone is waiting .
ms . <person> . i ' m asking you now , under oath , did <person> rape you ?
this wasn ' t my idea .
i haven ' t had any accident !
no , of course not . it wasn ' t an accident at all . it was attempted murder !
<person> . it wouldn ' t really be .
<person> ? can ' t we just skirt the issue ?
you ' ve got to be --
yeah , i know . more careful .
it was you , wasn ' t it ?
it was me , what ?
i need a gun .
it can ' t be that bad .
boy , he ' s got a helluva nerve !
just listen to the racket she ' s making ! what are we s ' posed to do ?
<person> .
four it is . four o ' clock exactly . thank you , dr . m .
there is something that i always wanted to know . tell me , how did those boys die ?
now who are we talking about ?
what happened to her ?
there was only one job . <person> took the job . her friend took a hike . never saw her again .
you , you don ' t under .
oh , yes , i do , <person> . believe me . you say you ' re going to lose . is it my fault ? listen ! the damned case doesn ' t start until tomorrow and already it ' s over for you !
<person> ' s get things straight , <person> . i ' m not going to take a cut . i worked hard and you can ' t decorate a room in new york for less than $ <number> , <number> .
i ' m kidding , i ' m kidding , we ' re still young , <person> . so what ' s money anyway when everybody ' s making it , it ' s all relative . after all , this is not the house in connecticut , this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years . before we slip our two lovely kids , <person> and <person> into the lycee francaise .
a rumor is not a rumor that doesn ' t die .
what ?
oh . well alright , you can be red if you want .
not now , <person> . i ' ve got some bad news .
<person> , i tell ya , i bet you could sell a ton of these things .
that ? too silly-looking .
yep . you ' re right . that ' s why i ' m here .
what ' ll it be ?
or really ? but that ' s very creative . <continued_utterance> but on second thought , i see what you mean . it makes me nervous . you think it must have come from one of our game players ?
it sure didn ' t come from me . the tone of it in the game was very , very passionate , fanatical . and the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming . the whole thing felt unstable , dangerous , volatile . but worse than that , there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot . <person> game-systems , jumping ship from one game company to another . that kind of thing .
is this that girl from last year ?
did you know her ?
-- we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal . he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president . i think we ' ve won .
a thing like this . who could even think of winning ?
who ' s <person> ?
well , i really can ' t tell you about <person> unless i first tell you about <person> .
but that ' s not the point .
that is the point . and <person> ' ll slip off the hook .
would you , um , say it ' s a big storm ?
sometimes it gets exciting out here .
<person> .
do you want a coffee ?
guess he thought the other terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste .
they call him `` the sand spider '' .
who called through ?
someone from new york . <continued_utterance> about a security job at a museum . they want to hire you . i didn ' t know you guys were moving to new york . thanks for telling me .
liz we ' ve got to cancel , we have to put it off .
<person> ' t even .
of course i will .
you won ' t .
he kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different . you are in every way our son , <person> , and we your family . you must know that . <continued_utterance> you can speak to him . he can see and hear us , even now .
how long will it last ?
<person> way to tie up a . ' <person> ' problem ?
moving along - a typical plastic security card . name here , magnetic information stripe here - and a code breaking microprocessor here . swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you ' re in .
why didn ' t you tell the guerrillas ?
i don ' t know . then they would ' ve killed him i guess . i didn ' t want to interfere .
she ' s still working ?
that ' s right .
yes , but not a lot more .
i don ' t give a damn . it ' s split five ways .
you ' re right !
what are you afraid of ?
well , no , not <continued_utterance> my philosophy is if you don ' t have a sense of humor , you ' re better off dead .
yeah . well you just might get your wish .
here . you ' re going to need these where we ' re going .
she ' s in love .
<person> !
you working on strike two ?
we have the ability to change the color , odor , and physical property of cocaine .
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr . <person> . that ' s nothing new .
what ' s that ?
selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer .
jai alai ?
yeah , i don ' t know why but i always felt at home in the fronton .
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about . this is just a whole ' nother ball game !
thelma , please get a hold of yourself . you ' re making a spectacle .
i don ' t blame you for that .
but i ' d face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains . <person> - - i won ' t be any trouble , because i don ' t eat a thing -- and i won ' t try to manage things , because i can ' t think . <person> ' t you take me with you ?
<person> , then . <person> hardapple . the scar ' s are from a -- from a horse . he fell during a race and got trampled .
and now he ' s addicted to painkillers .
i ' ll miss my bus .
this is worth it . <person> looks conflicted . grady trust me .
it sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters .
<person> is exactly why we must celebrate . to show the world that the king of france is strong enough to face any enemy on any field . to show france . that he is king . he will listen to you . if you will speak .
you ' re here for two years , three maximum . what ' d they promise you ? court appointment ? what ? district ? appeals ? not <person> . <person> ?
i ' ve come in to do a tough job and that ' s what i ' m going to focus on .
i ' m the villain . i thought it could be a little cleaner this time -- me in central america , him in new york .
that ' s pretty clean .
<person> .
well , <person> , you ' ve done a very good job , but we ' ll take care of it from here . <continued_utterance> we ' ve been following these narco- trafficantes for some time but had not been able to bring them to justice . put the prisoners in the car . impound the truck . <continued_utterance> one question . how did you find about this ?
you know what this is , don ' t you ? it ' s a golden opportunity . a springboard for you to run for governor . <continued_utterance> ever hear of a civil war general named <person> ?
no .
we ' ll ground her , clip her wings a bit . <person> and scheduled activities and that ' s it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . <person> , in the district attorney ' s office , will probably help us out , quietly . <person> , this could be embarrassing .
<person> , this is difficult , but we ' ve all had our moments . i tried --
oh , i ' m so glad you ' re not a dinosaur !
why , thank you . now thank you all for your kind welcome .
<person> ' t there a pilot whose name is <person> ?
yeah , the copilot -- he ' s up front . the businessman disappears in the direction of the cockpit . <continued_utterance> i ' m leaving it all up to you , <person> , but if you do give me your phone number , then <person> , then .
we want to see the wizard .
not nobody ! not . <continued_utterance> . nohow !
what about the car ? i left it at the pier .
leave it . it ' s been a while since i ' ve had a walk with my daughter .
he was accused of jury tampering .
<person> . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . <person> worked with <person> until <person> retired in ' seventy- eight . since then he ' s been on his own . four cases before the circuit court . he lost them all . he drinks .
soft stuff . i guess .
oh no , i swear to god this is unreal ! can you believe that bastard <person> ? ! ' a little package , ' he tells me on the phone , ' just put it aside till thursday . ' put it aside -- can you believe him ! ?
<person> ?
<person> . you gave me this number .
getting by .
i ' m -- i ' m returning something .
he did . she ' s in the picture . i went over to look and she ' s gone . the table was set for one .
and that means he murdered his wife ?
if you ' re so innocent , why ' d you run ?
gee , <person> , i ' m a rabbit . we always run .
' practice and methodology in anaesthesia . ' general textbook on the subject . is that correct ?
i . yes . it is .
just tell me where she is .
<person> ' t do that shit again .
no , the people i ' m babysitting for might try to reach me .
well , as i say , there ' s nothing we can really do to help you down here .
see if this helps .
aaaaaahhhh . <person> . here , i made something for the baby .
so when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training , you thought he was making a mistake ?
no .
go ahead . you can all go home .
we just wan na take a look around your place , <person> . we ' re not here to bust your balls .
help me live until i die ?
i will .
. words to live by ?
your choice . <person> at the time ! come . there ' s someone i want you meet - about a story i ' m thinking of publishing .
they ' re singing .
it ' s a disgusting song .
<person> ! <person> , leave him alone !
you stay away , <person> . i aim to mess him up , and that ain ' t a thing for a woman to see .
<person> says you come from heavy indian blood . i used to think <person> was gettin ' senile . now i know he is .
move it , <person> .
you were great the other night .
thank you . so were you . <person> . he tries to touch her hair . she ducks .
well , it looks like we can get on this road <number> that heads down towards <person> , then cut over to .
i don ' t want to go that way . find a way that we don ' t have to go through texas .
what ' re you doing here ?
free country . now it ' s free , anyway . <person> ! <continued_utterance> how ' bout a quickie ? no ? things are heating up in thailand . thought i ' d check it out . you ain ' t gon na turn me in , are ya ?
girl , do you still sing and dance ?
no , i ' m a different person now , <person> .
<person> is . . i don ' t know .
<person> . and when your friend crabtree gets done with him , he ' s going to be even more disturbed .
he points to a dilapidated gardener ' s shed .
we also require a blacksmith ' s shop so we can craft braces here on the premises . i ' ve found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes . his work is outstanding . of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital . that ' s going to put my fund raising abilities to the test .
but that doesn ' t make you the boss of everything , son .
<person> ' t you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family ?
it was an authorized test . i returned the money .
i see .
oh , i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you . i haven ' t wrung a chicken ' s neck in a month of sundays . you know , folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs . that used to be my trade from time to time .
well , i would appreciate that .
you lie in the middle of the road , look like you ' re hurt . when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head .
why do i have to lie in the road ?
you take care .
if you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little . we ' ll be here . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t no word in sioux for goodbye .
they ' ll kill you .
<person> save my baby .
to <person> ! !
leave her out of this !
no .
well , i ' m sorry you can ' t stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again .
<person> ? is that what you call listening in on stranger ' s phone conversations ?
these ain ' t strangers , they ' re <continued_utterance> meaning these are the people you live amongst , you got a right to know if they ' re creeps . for instance , did you know there ' s a guy down the hall cheating on his wife ?
you answer him , but you answer him wrong and you ' re going to be staring at your insides while you ' re dying . <continued_utterance> <person> !
stop them !
or you could just take your phone off the hook .
no , the people i ' m babysitting for might try to reach me .
what are we going to do ?
slip out your m- <number> .
<person> ' t need to .
take your jacket off ?
so you ' ll help us ?
i am bound by honor to our king . i can not open the bifrost to you .
do i get to stay and hear my grade ?
not a chance , mr . <person> . such things are reserved for girl talk only . and for good reason .
where ? !
way up ahead !
it got read , i assure you . but probably not by me .
he ' s open right there .
about an hour after her bottle , she starts yawning . put her to bed right away or it ' s pure hell for the next three hours , at least that ' s what we ' ve noticed .
what the hell is that ? a baby ?
you were the admitting nurse at st . <person> on may twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night <person>eborah ann kaye was admitted .
yes .
i don ' t know . <person> is the only real witness against <person> . the security is very tight . there may not be a way .
there ' s always a way . if people get to the pope or the president , you can get to him .
i thought this was an informal meeting . what ' s he doing here ?
<person> , you don ' t mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times , do you ?
a man like you must be an expert on women .
it ' s a little immodest to say so , but i consider myself an authority on the fair sex , i ' ve made a study of the subject . they ' re simple creatures .
so , a little excitement in an otherwise dull day . did is work out okay ?
oh , sure . <person> . i ' ll get some more gravy .
is it dead ?
yeah , <person> , you got it .
you know what that does to me . <continued_utterance> ohmigod . you ' ll never believe . i saw <person> .
you ' re kidding .
you think you ' ve stopped it . what i ' ve worked for fifty years to create . you haven ' t stopped it . you can ' t stop it . you ' re just one man .
you ' re wrong .
<person> ' t sweet lip me .
i don ' t understand where this personal attack is coming from .
i don ' t know , you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down . i told you we were closing . <continued_utterance> want some coffee ?
huh ? <continued_utterance> you alright ?
maybe i jumped the gun . <person> aren ' t near as bad as they ' re painted . you know i was thinkin ' , there ' s a lot of money in the cattle business .
wait a minute , you thinkin ' of getting in bed with the cowboys ?
<person> ' t worry about him .
of course , i ' d have to wait a while until i can work again .
anything you want .
they ' re holding the lead in the world section for <person> .
but we ' ve got to verify it legally to see .
to see ?
i ' m not thr -- you explore it . i ' m going back to work . <continued_utterance> oh , and i have to pick up rudy today because there ' s no one else to do it . but i ' ll find someone as soon as i have time .
yeah . <person> . why don ' t you just take over the whole bank ?
it doesn ' t mean anything . she buys antiquities for <person> .
<person> . the art buys are in a separate ledger .
<person> <person>er .
`` <person> <person>er . `` what brings you to superior , <person> ?
you put up a great fight , <person> .
yeah --
are you serious ? this is the only version that exists ?
security is everything these days . it ' s the only one and its stuck inside and it ' s your fault . <continued_utterance> i ' ve devoted my five most passionate years to this strange little creature . and i ' ve never regretted it , <person> , because i knew that it was the only thing that could give my life any meaning .
a glimmer . <person> to stir it around a bit .
<person> ! ticking away madly . wheels within wheels . this is the brain that , in darkest italy , devised a formula to make food out of k-ration ! <person>hhh !
i don ' t think they ' ll forget the fire .
you know what we should do ? you and me should kill the biggest boar ever -- just huge ! -- and take it back to the village . just to show them . and we won ' t let anyone else eat it . they ' ll have to watch us eat it .
why don ' t you call her back ?
i don ' t have the number . i got a message to her through her agency , they won ' t tell me where she is . i don ' t even know where she was calling from . and you better believe she ' s not going
all right .
i ' d be glad to give it some thought .
new hushpuppies don ' t make a new man .
you ' ve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers .
when did he start sleeping like that ?
about the time <person> left .
oh that ' s too bad . <person> will be going .
you check with her , <person> .
the plane . it ' s all been arranged .
then you are completely unnecessary .
i ' m not . what ' s the problem ?
we ' re supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats , now they ' re telling me that there was a mistake and we can ' t have padded .
maybe he ' s fat .
i don ' t care about that .
<person> , that ' s got to be pretty vexing .
for my sin the ground is cursed . thorns and thistles does it sprout for us , and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives . for as the lord has commanded , by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken . for dust you are , and to dust shall you return .
can you borrow some cash from your brother ?
um , yeah , but that would involve speaking to him .
i don ' t see how that plan ' s any better .
<person> ' s got to send the gold up . it can ' t get on the line by itself .
the poor girl .
there ' s more . before i left school , i searched her room .
you talkin ' to me ?
yeah , man , can you help me ? do you know where cutting blvd . is ?
fire . i ' m frightened of fire . i can ' t get out if i ' m upstairs .
we ' ve got options .
thanks , but i ' m fine .
so you ' ll have some later . notice anything . different ?
no sir .
ever been to a show ?
what ? i ' m a friend of his .
i ' m sorry . last night sergeant carter was killed in the line of duty .
<person> frontier type . long and lean . and those gray eyes . like a wild hawk . you see quite a few of his type out here .
oh , i want one .
well that wouldn ' t be hard . <person> , do you need something ? cause i got ta go .
yes , are you going to <person> tomorrow ? <person> giggles at her own joke . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
two feet , one sock . i must be .
i ' ll get around to the other one , eventually .
<person> .
frank <person> . we ' ve met before .
what about witnesses ?
we ' ve got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .
the young man who rescued us from the bandit .
the young man on the scaffold ?
um-huh . and guess what else ? i have toys .
well , z guess one taste wouldn ' t hurt .
even when you infuriate me , i still want to kiss you .
but you never do .
i see that friendship is important to you .
it is . but as his best friend , i also know that he ' s trying to finish a novel about inadequacy and rejection . so the longer i stay , the better it is for his career .
no . he left everything to the municipal parks system . he wanted the town park dedicated in his name .
that scumbag ! he never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money . did you know about this ?
why .
i have to give this baby to some- body .
i don ' t even know why you would say that ?
neither do i . it just flew out of my mouth .
that ' s our plan .
well , i just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so i can get the ball rolling .
you think she upgraded ?
they went in through the belly button .
<person> , we take goddam care of it .
we haven ' t had a decent night ' s sleep in two weeks . <person> ' s probably going to lose a $ <number> , <number> contract .
<person> . <continued_utterance> mom . <continued_utterance> i have ' ta go . <continued_utterance> i ' ll call you .
come home anytime .
what does <person> ' s father look like ?
very handsome . wavy black hair . he looks like a movie star .
<person> . <person> , dear . it ' s <person> , darling .
oh , <person> -- it ' s you !
i don ' t buy it .
you don ' t buy what ?
yes . say goodbye , <person> . <continued_utterance> yes , i ' m ready now .
then close your eyes , and tap your heels together three times . <continued_utterance> and think to yourself -- `` there ' s no place like home ; there ' s no place like home ; there ' s no place like home . ``
just giving the facts .
i ' m calling the police .
i might be very interested , but why ? why you mate -- how ' d you get mixed up with <person> ? he doesn ' t know the difference between raiding and insider trading . i do . the sec does .
<person> ' s just say mr . <person> and i have a conflict of interest . i want to see this airline work . . the figures here show it can .
i ' m going back home with <person> .
i ' ve heard some foolish things in my life .
and she seems to be growing .
hmm .
that don ' t sound like any kind of name for a dog .
i ' ll have you know i ' ve named him after the deceased french writer , <person> camus . author of l ' <person> and other works of existential brilliance .
like muddy waters ?
it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like .
your will ! your will ! what else could it be ?
i can ' t remember all these things .
this was <person> ' s boat . guess she won ' t be needin ' it .
i wouldn ' t have guessed <person> was a sailor .
<person> .
and she seems to be growing .
yes sir , and we also took the girls twice around the town for a little run . they were stiff from the train .
makes the blood circulate,
who do you think it is ?
the chancellor ' s here ? now ?
what you got there , the salvation army ?
<person> .
they - they don ' t know me . you do . they won ' t take me unless you go . <person> at me .
tough break .
very ambitious . i like that .
the thing is , i ' ll need a first mate .
i look forward to meeting him .
so do i .
actually , no .
he thinks he ' s a tough guy , but he ' s a hopeless romantic .
we ' re supposed to be honest .
<person> and <person> . that ' s very interesting .
it ' s not gon na be his , you idiot .
why not ?
what happened to <person> ?
as your father knew , things need to be sacrificed to the future .
good to see you too . nice whiskers .
<person> , this is mr . <person> . he gets sea-sick at the mere sight of a boat so he ' s probably happy that it ' s being <person> right now .
keep tight inside of them -- their magic must be very powerful , or she wouldn ' t want them so badly !
you stay out of this , glinda , or i ' ll fix you as well !
a lot of people seem to think there was some hostility out there .
well i can ' t really comment on what `` a lot of people '' thought . i can only tell you that we had a horrible accident here and were all feeling extremely traumatized and your questions are a bit poorly timed . we ' re in full on grieving mode right now thank you very much officer . <person> .
this morning . i found a note in the kitchen .
but . . why didn ' t you say something , <person>p ? i mean , what are we doing here ? grady gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield , turns on the ignition .

-glenda . and tell <person> ' ll take my chances with the fake vampires .
we are not at war , sir , not until we ' re at defcon <number> .
general , the joint chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the soviets . you have signalled an escalation which i had no wish to signal , and which i did not approve .
. <number> beverage cup holders ?
standard equipment . the world ' s automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders .
in a captured brewery . <person> sensible , giving a party in a brewery . cuts out the middleman .
do you remember when <person> climbed up - - the tower of the city hall and rang the bell by swinging on the clapper ? he couldn ' t hear anything for two days .
it could help with a new car --
-- i like the car i have .
yeah .
<person> straight up and a rum and <person> for me . <continued_utterance> looks like there ' s good action here tonight .
i ' ll be back in a couple of hours . and be careful with her , will you ? <person> slams down the hood .

you ' re telling me you don ' t get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .
you don ' t know anything about ba- bies .

it was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like .

<person> ? that ' s away from the hummer ; further into iraqi .
there ' s another pass on the photo . we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .

maybe , yeah . <person> , i don ' t know .
i told you , this is a shortcut . <person> , you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway . this used to be called `scenic <number> ' because there ' s an amazing view of the valley-

that ' s been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .
you aint gon na begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour , are you , sugar ? i mean , here you are crossin state lines with a a- number one certified murderer .
<person> , honey , not murderer .

you two should continue this discussion in private .
your thoughts on the matter interest me . they might . help .
the bride doesn ' t want to chat ?
stop it .
it can work . if , if they believe we ' ll hit them . <continued_utterance> we ' ve only got time for one more round of diplomacy . the first airstrikes start in less than <number> hours .

i think they are too serious , these american fishermen . in honduras , we are not so concerned with the method . reggie orders martinis for the three of them .
what ' s the matter with you ?
nothing . i ' m just tired .
that ' s the idea . want you to hear a song i just wrote .
if it ' s a love song , don ' t get too close .
i know one .
not the doctor lady ?
is that how do you explain what ' s happened to you ?
what --
i need to know what i ' m working with ; what their boundaries are . their lives depend on it , and for that matter so does yours . we ' ve got to bring them together . make them a crew . we ' re as strong as our weakest link and i don ' t want to find that out the hard way . so , i will challenge them and they will come together .
yes sir .
negotiating with whom ?
i think you know . the timetable has been set . it will happen on a holiday , when people are away from their homes . when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country . the president will declare a state of emergency , at which time all federal agencies , all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency . fema , <person> . the secret government .
<person> , hannah . you don ' t remember where that aunt worked , do you ? <person> ' aunt .
he shot the chancellor ' s dog , didn ' t he ? the blind one .
maybe .
it ' s my father . he gets it from his doctor .
<person> . you ' ll die for your crimes . nothing can stop that . but how you leave this world is up to you .
what did the world ever do for me ?
but you ' re a great swordsman ! <continued_utterance> you ' re not a warrior , <person> ! a warrior wouldn ' t lie there and do nothing ! he kicks <person> ' s boot and knocks his feet off the log . <continued_utterance> we ' re in trouble ! you ' ve seen the big army that ' s after us ! you ' re a fake ! you ' re a bum ! you ' re a -- you ' re a coward ! !
what ' s with you , <person> ?
<person> , boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man . a boy ' s whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed .
so far , i agree .
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . iandiacute ; m not sure why , but until we find out , i must ask you to stay .
no thanks . <person> goes to the door .
do i live alone ? yes i do . do you live alone ?
yes . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
i bet if you ' d promised <person> some moccasins he ' d of got ' em .
no talk about <person> , okay ? and ditto the moccasins . we , can ' t , afford , them .
i remember you somersaulting through the air .
who was that girl you were with ?
<person> ?
no doubt . you ' ll probably be shot at in less than two chapters .
thanks a pantsful , but i ' m not gay . if you ' re really concerned though , i suggest you get me a room at the ukiah motel <number> . if anyone can straighten me out , it ' s <person> .
that sounds more like a job for your father . here , he wants to talk to you .
i just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .
<person> . i never get into bed with somebody unless i know for sure . just the way i was raised .
then it would be fine . we ' d say `` <person> dinked . `` `` the garbage man dinked . ``
my turtle just dinked .
that ' s fine . we ' ve got some new things to teach them .
damn it ! they ' ll sink this rig just like a boat !
that ' s fine , but - even a little london girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing .
was he carrying anything ? <continued_utterance> search him . <continued_utterance> do i have to do everything around here ?
i want to be alone .
what ?
to make sure she ' s all right .
<person> , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of --
you love her , but you hate her ?
no , i hate loving her . i hate the kind of person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little `` games '' she plays . like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me . the bitch . she loved to play . she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it . she tortures me . but she ' s family . she ' s my little girl . my baby . i couldn ' t stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . no . not me . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy . how much you want ? a pause .
i need your help --
get out ! get the hell away from me !
you ' ll be safe . you don ' t have to worry . she says nothing . <continued_utterance> <person> , they ' re thinking as long as they keep the killer out of <person> ' s way , we can ' t make an i . d . there ' s no way they can know <person> saw that photograph , so he ' s safe . <continued_utterance> i mean it . you will be safe .
oh yes ! of course . why shouldn ' t we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other !
did you ever ?
depends on what you call love . i grew up on a reservation . a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . that ' s where they stick indians , <person> . that ' s where they leave us to die . my brother killed himself when he was <number> cause he couldn ' t take it anymore . there ' s no hope there . <person> was my ticket out . <person> and me .
how long does it take for the infection to take hold ?
no time at all .
i lied .
you added ? <continued_utterance> okay .
yeah . i meant . you know what i ' m going to do with it ? i ' m going to buy a sixty- three ' <person> . all tricked out and cherry . i ' m going to be so sweet .
a car ? you ' re going to buy a car ?
the way you talk . <person> heard a <person> talk like that .
oh look , i haven ' t got time to be proper , i want to live . i ' m a woman , i like men . if that ' s <person> then i guess i ' m not a lady . at least i ' m honest .
all good .

the victim was red-haired , about thirty- five , wearing a jogging suit . did you encounter anyone by that description in the building ? sir ? <person> hasn ' t heard a word . <continued_utterance> have there been any wild parties lately ? <continued_utterance> could it perhaps be one of your neighbors ? <continued_utterance> as you can see , no one here knows anything . he continues to stand there , dumbstruck for a moment .
there .
where ?
see . <person> ' t nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that ' s where he belongs anyways . me and <person> , that ' s my dog , not anymore , but me and <person> we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then . a companion that ' s loyal , that ' ll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him . i miss him . i ' ll see ya later , unless i come across something worse .
<person> i give you a hand , beautiful ?
<person> , this is insane . you ' re picking horses because you think you ' re clairvoyant or something .
<person> , i ' m not doing too well by checking the stats , so why not . i put my hand to my forehead , i see a one -- mr . motor in the second . twenty bucks .
yeah .
of all the things in the world that scare you , what ' s the worst thing that scares you the most ?
his majesty , the king .
your majesty .
what do you mean ?
<person> or <person> ?
mr . <person> says you ' re one of the smarter people he knows-
-dubious honor if you knew the other people <person> knows . so you want to catch her in violation of her service contract ?
yes , <person> .
<person> . <person> ' s go sailing .
if you want me to remember something in the morning , then tell it to me in the morning .
<person> , come on .
that ' s what i ' d planned to .
i ' m going to take you to the home to see the girl .
i -- i -- i -- i -- got ta get her outta there ?
that ' s right .
why do you have to stay so long ?
because my sister is not a bank , you know ? i can ' t just show up and ask her for --
that ' s right .
i think we tried that . the case is over . <continued_utterance> and how the fuck . you broke the first law that they taught you in law school . you never ask a question you don ' t know the answer to . <person> , wake up . you got your own expert witness says there was no negligence . it ' s over . <person> . there ' ll be no other cases .
we been down this road . i told you how it is . unless you feel like there ' s something you want to do about it .
what if i do ? <continued_utterance> what if i do ? <continued_utterance> you talk loud , and don ' t even have a big stick to back it up with .
nah , she asked the wrong question .
what was that ?
i don ' t think it really matters , <person> . we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point . <continued_utterance> ail right . in my office .
hey . if you want to talk later . i ' ll be up .
you ' re a very odd fellow .
two feet , one sock . i must be .
that is depressing .
why ?
they ' ll never prove it to me . and everything smells so beautiful . what is it - pine or fir ?
we ' re near the bakery .
got ta find a new business to get into .
new ? very hard to find something new to get into .
yes , very . and very married .
oh , so that ' s it .
fixing the mower . <continued_utterance> i saw my father on state street dressed as a homeless man . <continued_utterance> what do you want ?
i made macaroni .
<person> , he demanded confidentiality .
gim me a break . you buy bluestar airlines yesterday . today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit . you must have esp . a real nostradamus . <person> , what are friends for ?
hey , you ' re right !
' course we ' d still have to worry about <person> ' s <person> and <person> and <person> ' s <person> .
<person> ' t seen you since i was thrown out of one eyed <person> .
what else did we do together ? oh , i remember . hey , you know what ? it ' s been a year . she ' s been dead a year . she ' s been dead a year .
this is <person> . nothing can happen here .
keep your guard up . that ain ' t coolidge out on that porch .
or not .
their store is new . it ' s a novelty . but it will all shake out . do you think i should put up more twinkle lights ?
the mutt jumped .
not even the people who don ' t know you believe that . if somebody from the da ' s office decides to dig , you could fry boy-o . be nice to be in with a billionaire who ' s got a fleet of planes , fly you outta the country on a moment ' s notice . c ' mon -- it ' s a cake legal gig . he just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him . <continued_utterance> tomorrow . <person> , <number> pm it ' ll be worth it .
<person> put <person> ' s head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago . and threatened him several times since . president <person> and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat .
i ' d just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down .
the gentle and soothing lullaby of a piece of machinery so perfect --
i know where i ' ve heard it before . i know .
it ' s real . i ' m telling you , it ' s real .
so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase ? it ' s crazy . tell him it ' s crazy , <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , tell him . <continued_utterance> you ' re out of your minds , you know that ? both of you . you don ' t even know if there ' s anything out there . what the hell are you thinking ?
i don ' t know ! i just want to get married .
say it again .
he doesn ' t deserve it .
none of this is your business anymore . now get back inside <person> !
and if he rests ?
you ' ll lose him anyway . i ' m sorry .
we ' re out at the place in palm springs . you should come out for the weekend .
tell <person> if i get minute-
<person> had turned her out . using her the way the romans used to use their daughters when they did business : some pussy to sweeten the pot . <person> was she got picked up in this trick sweep few weeks back .
<person> was whoring her ?
maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss , and were really mean to you , and told you what a terrible thing it was . maybe it ' d be better if you told me how i ' m endangering my immortal soul , and if i don ' t quit i ' m going to burn in hell . <person> ' t you ever think that ?
um . no .
before we go any further here , mr . <person> , from lloyds of london , i just want to get two things straight .
. yes ?
what if that doesn ' t work ?
we ' ll torture him . you don ' t think i got this far by being a nice guy ?
just doing my duty .
and one more to demonstrate our own faith and charity .
<person> ' . forget it . <continued_utterance> you had a vision . you had yourself a vision . a man waits a long time for a vision . <person> go his whole lifetime and never get one . and along comes some instant indian with a mastercard and brand-new shoes , has himself a vision .
<person> .
but i can see from your walk that you didn ' t sleep with her . <continued_utterance> let me see if i can guess . you haven ' t slept with her because . it ' s more fun when you can draw it out . <person> just isn ' t as good if the woman hasn ' t told all her friends she ' d never sleep with you .
you ' re right on the money , <person> .
no .
does it require clothes ?
i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i ' m about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss <person> conroy of xenia , ohio .
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
thank-you . her name is <person> .
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ?
being born .
remember how i said it all happened so fast with <person> i didn ' t have time to think about it ? well i ' ve had plenty of time to think about this . i spent most of my life since i was born not knowing what i want out of life , just chasin ' my tail . but now , for the first time i know exactly what i want . and who . and that ' s the damnable misery of it . i can ' t beat him , can i ?
from the irs . i never even remember seeing it . i must have left it with my other bills . i wonder what it is ?
maybe it ' s a refund check .
go for it , <person> ! knock it on !
this is why we split up -- he always went for it .
i don ' t know . taking pictures . the usual . <person> got me released .
<person> ? ! you think there ' s a story there ?
i ' ll have you court-martialed !
you don ' t mind being ungrateful , you just don ' t like being told you are !
tough break .
<person> ' t tell me you don ' t need this . is this your place ? <continued_utterance> they ' re never going to stop with us , you know that . this way we hit the cops where it hurts and get well in the mean time . <continued_utterance> as clean as you could ever get , they ' ll never let you go now .
he ' s under a lot of stress , <person> . his book , his interview which frankly didn ' t go so well , his birthday . that ' s a lot to bite off all at once . i ' ll give him a sedative and he ' ll be fine .
you really think so ?
you remind me of your father , sor- sha .
my father was a weakling .
new hampshire .
right .
that ' s a reasonable question for a reporter to ask , isn ' t it ? ! i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this is the way it ' s going to be . i ' ll make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there . i ' m gon na show up to work at rockefeller center every morning and they ' re gon na hand me the news with my coffee and toast . i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this war down here belongs to you guys , okay ? i ' m on tomorrow ' s plane .
<person> .
it ' s the generator i think ! no power .
well , let ' s get down there .
. sworn before god you would tell the truth ?
yes .
i know . call me back . <person> , i love you , okay ?
<person> .
why are you doing all this ? to impress me ?
no . but are you -- impressed ?
i see guys like you all the time in my work . you find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story , utterly convincing . and somewhere in there , you slip it in . ' i just need your credit card number ' , ' i just need a small down payment . ' <continued_utterance> did you know that this morning was the first morning i can remember , that i didn ' t open my eyes and feel that sadness . do you know what i ' m talking about ? that little bit of sadness ? i thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me . for why i survived that train . for why my life feels so out of balance . but i guess that ' s what you were counting on . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to leave now . <person> luck with your sale .
what type of job do you have <person> ? <continued_utterance> you mentioned you ' ve met ' guys like me ' in your work . what type of job would that be ?
he ' s a tourist . member of the teacher ' s union . pays his taxes .
evidently . he had a pair of russian hit men after him . are you still going to tell me <person> is clean ?
no . not yet he isn ' t .
well , i ' m going to read it anyway .
they ' ll take you for a cat scan tomorrow if you ' re feeling dizzy at all .
that won ' t be necessary . <continued_utterance> not unless there ' s a miracle drug for clumsiness .
to the gods , yes . that he is fallible . as the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth -- it ' s alive , this swing , a living sculpture -- and down through contact , always down , into terra firma , striking the ball crisply -- with character -- a tuning fork goes off in your heart , your balls -- such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot -- and then the follow through to finish , always on line -- the reverse ' c ' of the golden bear , the steelworker ' s power and brawn of <person> ' s arnold palmer , the da vinci of hogan , the unfinished symphony of roy mcavoy .
what ? what ' s unfinished ?
what happened with that guy at the cafe ?
nothing .
are you for real ?
you could have poured coffee in starbucks , you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings , you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet . you could have been one of ten thousand things . but in the end , you chose to protect people . you made that decision . and i find that very , very interesting . now all i need is your credit card number . <continued_utterance> that last part was a joke .
<person> , like it or not , they ' re your parents .
parents ? they ' re not my parents . they ' re my grandparents . my parents are dead . grady stares at-<person> wearily . <continued_utterance> i swear . my father had his own airplane he <continued_utterance> i ' swear . my father was a senior vice
<person> of a bitch ! where ?
it ' s an island in the keys , out past <person> .
<person> is an atheist too ?
buddhist , i believe , though we have not seen him in some time . i myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage .
i ' m not going to let you kill him .
we ' re at war .
i breached protocol . i broke contact with the s . a . c . i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
<person> says it was she who ordered you out of the building . that you wanted to go back .
no .
she ' s dead . <person> somebody !
well , if you don ' t like <person> , i can tell you right now you ain ' t gon na like this girl .
why not ?
because he ' s an inconsiderate asshole .
i ' m asking you seriously , <person> , a stranger ?
i mean , we ' re fine .
you ' re more than fine , you ' re absolutely fine .
i need you to pass me fit now , <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s just a scratch .
<person> . it wouldn ' t really be .
<person> , he just ate . <person> just stares at his friend . sully nineteen months i been sober .
what are you talking about ? you were never an alky , you were a cokehead .
have a great vacation !
you too .
and if that doesn ' t work ?
we offer him rewards .
it is true ! he doesn ' t know anything about me . he still thinks i ' m like ten years old or something . as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything ' s fine . but it ' s not fine . nothing ' s fine .
<person> ! come back here !
yes .
<person> ' t also true that his vessel went down off of nantucket ? lost everyone on board . in fair weather no less .
- but as i ' ve explained to <person> , without proof , there ' s just no story . <person> ' t you agree mr . <person> ?
but i have proof ! you ran out of here so fast , i didn ' t get to show you .
and what does that make you ?
the slimy bastard who ' s going to do it for you . you ' re a jealous man <person> . if you can ' t have <person> to yourself . well , you ' re not the sharing kind . for a moment <person> stares quietly at bobby .
from here on , i go it alone .
what ' s the point of chancing it , <person> ? we ' ll let you take the credit .
no . i can give her an abortion . <person> rid of the bastard child , make them conceive one in wedlock . and then we are right as rain .
abortion ? no . that we won ' t do .
i . i don ' t know what to say . i --
i mean , i know i haven ' t exactly been the most . decisive . guy . in the past . i don ' t know : i ' m tired of foolin ' around . and i love you .
that must make it tough .
sucks . so what ' s up ? you some kind of salesman or something ?
you city folk , ain ' t ya ? up from charleston roughing it , seeing how the `` other '' half lives ?
no , we ' re from virginia , just up for a weekend trip . and , uh . you folks live up here ?
it doesn ' t look like nothing .
scalp wounds bleed a lot . head wounds in general . that ' s why , if you ' re ever in a bar fight , the thing to do is pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose . it ' ll make his eyes fill with blood and snot , and buy you enough time to run away .
. tell me about this case .
this is a nuisance suit . he ' s looking for small change . he ' s asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don ' t want to go to court .
hey , is that `` old dog tray '' ?
what ?
i know how deep her pockets are , <person> . i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan . guess who ' s on the board of directors at the bank ? <continued_utterance> can ' t you take that stupid thing off ?
not in here . chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes . <continued_utterance> you ' re not in bad shape , really . i know you think you are , but you ' re not . <person> me tell you why . <person> .
yes .
how come you ' re not wearing my shoes ?
we pay for that kind of information . <continued_utterance> is that what you ' re talking about , <person> ?
ten years ago <person> had no drug problem . now it is epidemic . ten years ago america takes a hammer to <person> , a hammer to the miami drug trade , and you allowed everything to move to my country . you dumped the problem at our feet . now , drug use is epidemic . now , the treatment centers are full and get no state money . they survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to sell to the
heimdall ! open the bifrost ! <continued_utterance> he would open it if he could . i fear the worst .
then we ' re trapped here forever .
<person> , his heart has only one desire . to become a musketeer .
then kneel , d ' <person> . <continued_utterance> the world is an uncertain realm , filled with danger . <person> despoiled by broken promises . <person> undermined by the pursuit of gold . <person> sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the strong . but there are those who oppose these powerful forces . those who dedicate their lives to truth , honor , and freedom . they are a constant reminder to all of us . that such a life is not just possible , but necessary to our continued survival . as a country , as a king . these men are known as the musketeers .
why didn ' t you tell me ?
i didn ' t know who i could trust .
let me know when you ' re coming down .
well , i ' m just gon na go get my stuff from the car .
you ' re right . these are the actions of a boy . treat them as such . you and i can stop this before there ' s further bloodshed .
we are beyond diplomacy now , <person> . he ' ll get what he came for -- war and death .
there ' s no real turkey ?
no , it ' s just regulation paper targets . it ' s a test of skill . and , <person> , i just found out yesterday that they won ' t let kids shoot .
faster and faster . for a long time you wouldn ' t feel anything . then you would burst into fire . forever .
maybe i better start our homework .
no . i think it ' s fucked .
then fuck what your father said , cause i ' m gon na tell you right now . you ' ll know what it ' s all about , why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning , and the streetlight ' s coming through the window and it ' s just catching a corner of her face , like a sleeping angel . and her hair smells sweet and she ' s your ' s . she ' s all your ' s . do you see where i ' m going here ?
. takes years of genetics , pal , and a yale education . and the right tailor .
. not that you learned anything , <person> . <continued_utterance> i got ta feeling we ' re going to make a killing today , <person> .
would you say he was boring , then ?
yeah . i suppose he is .
skinny lunger , your guns don ' t impress me . <person> ' t for those guns you ' d be nothin ' .
why <person> , what an ugly thing to <person> ! does this mean you ' re not my friend anymore ? you know , <person> , if i thought you weren ' t my friend i <person> ' t think i could bear it . <continued_utterance> there , now we can be friends again . but remember , <person> , friendship is trust-so please <person> ' t hurt me .
sure . my mom and lance are going to a movie and i ' m planning on stealing <person> ' s trailer and torching it in a parking lot , so you ' ll have the whole house to yourself .
right on .
<person> ?
i sure would .
all right , i ' ll go explain the situation .
no , no , <person> , please , really , don ' t go , don ' t bother , i ' ll go explain it to her myself .
what ?
what is the question you asked me ?
will he be back soon ?
doubt it . he ' s dead . the <person> out ' s a cemetery .
the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man ' s surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him . it ' s just a reminder of what should have been his . <continued_utterance> your old man graduates from <person> , you ' re not supposed to wind up there . <person> of <person> maybe , but not in the lousy guidance office . now . <person> number two . i ' ve run a financial on <person> . <person> was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like <person> .
so what about the girls ? <person> ' s poor , but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ? surely her father . <continued_utterance> this one ' s got you working overtime , hasn ' t it ?
but how did you know where i lived ?
asked around .
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we ' ve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .
what alien environment ?
by far the worst .
. i don ' t wan na trade insults with you .
that may be the case at present , minister <person> . but our own sources suspect that mr . <person> used his considerable russian media - holdings to elect <person> president of the ukraine - in trade for the uranium .
more scurrilous , unsubstantiated gossip .
so how did you get here ?
bus .
there ' s nothing to tell . it ' s been stricken from the record .
i know . did you believe her ?
i don ' t know what you came here for , but we won ' t have any part of it .
<person> , please .
six hundred three , six hundred four , six hundred five .
go for it !
i . you know . i .
<person> care of my lizards , <person> .
<person> .
my parents sleep in separate beds .
oh my god ! who did this to you ? !
. please , officer , just take the booze and let me go . she reaches toward him .
some times .

no , no , no , no . the soil on the shovel , his shovel . that ' s clay . it ' s not from here , believe me , i . all right , look at this .
our house .

well , you ' re the doctor .
yeah , <person> .
we ' re in deep shit over here . <person> ' s change that plan .
actually , i ' ve never known you to do either . but -
- we all want what we can ' t have ?
yeah .
i want you to call <person> .
it ' s a quarter mile to the marina . why do you need the car ?
i ' m picking everybody up .
bring you back . to pay for what you did to my son .
and if i resist . ?
you think i want to hurt a pretty thing like you ? pains me , but . until you and your husband obey , my hands , much like yours , are tied .
i know about your condition , ida . it ' s not your fault . there are a lot of women that can ' t carry a baby full term . i know how much you ' re hurting .
at home you ' d never hear a woman scream at a man that way .
no ? why not ?
yeah , in a minute .
i don ' t think i can take any more of these surprises .
i ' m sorry , <person> . i ' ve been crazy about you forever , and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot , but i just can ' t go through with it .
sure you can . you ' re only human . it ' s not like you ' re made of steel . or are you ?
j . d . ! just tell me . i know you ' re not some schoolboy . now come on , nobody ever tells me shit .
i ' m just some guy . a guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now .
<person> . i was an agent -- i ' m not now -- just tell me who i am ! how did we know each other ? why are they trying to kill me ? !
i ' m not trusting you again .
i ' m sorry . you said it hurt ? why ?
because . it was the biggest i ' ve ever seen . and i ' ve seen a lot on their way through <person> ' s <person> .
watch your mouth , will you ? i ' m in love with that young lady .
<person> ' t she speak softly like everyone else ?
that can ' t feel good .
no , it doesn ' t . <person> , look , i see what you ' re doing here , and that ' s , i ' m sorry , but that ' s not it . my marriage is fine . i ' ve had some kind of `` empty-nest '' episode where i saw some things that weren ' t there . <person> ' s deal with that . i ' m willing to deal with that . i just don ' t want to go conjuring problems where none exist .
<person> : gim me a cuesta-ray .
oh shit , what ' s today ?
i said he did .
ms . <person> . i ' m asking you now , under oath , did <person> rape you ?
if i don ' t ' grow up . '
you ' re like a kid , you ' re coming in here like it ' s saturday night , you want me to say that you ' ve got a fever -- you don ' t have to go to school .
i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me , revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet .
oh . oh , that ' s good .
why ? what is it ?
you ' ve had an exhausting night , why don ' t you .
they sure do stink .
<person> , i guess , but - and heres the lesson part - they aint supposed to be so bad for you .
<person> away from my woman .
your woman ? i ' m not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual `` thing '' going .

thank you .
you want some visine , man ?
my . eyes . <continued_utterance> . they ' re burning .

we have to wait .
yes but --
are you writing another book ?
i ' m in the home stretch . i ' ll be done in approximately six more years .
. yes . get her on the phone .

you think bad , and bad is what you get .
that ' s a good piece of advice , <person> .
the pictures will be used to firm up our estimates of the missiles ' readiness and develop target packages for strikes should you order them .
our guy running this show is the best . commander <person> of the navy ' s vfp <number> , the fightin ' photo . something of a character , but the highest efficiency ratings we ' ve ever had .

i ' d say you ' ve got a problem . <continued_utterance> you could use a lesson in manners .
any time .
we ' ll see . <person> ' s try <person> .
so <person> was human , huh ? <continued_utterance> so that make you a murderer .
for once , i agree with you . <continued_utterance> so she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father , on me .
no . i wanted you . i wanted you for myself . <continued_utterance> since you sent your man to kill me , i have been watching time tick slowly away , marching inevitably toward my own death . <person> these hands , m . at noon tomorrow , your time is up . and i guarantee you . i will not miss . you will die . <person> with everyone in this city and the future of the west .
just keep looking at that beautiful sky .
what ?
what if i fall . trying to get to the podium .
if you fall , you show them how to get up .
oh really ? what ' s his problem ?
his problem is that he ' s like totally sheltered because you treat him like he ' s three , instead of eight , so that ' s how he behaves .
you notice that woman when we come in ? the white woman sittin by herself ?
yeah .
you mean she bit you ?

couple seconds of an argentine disco station .
well , stick with it . i want you at it round the clock . we got to get help in here .
huh ? oh , no . this isn ' t <person> ' s . i just write in it .
i guess there ' s probably a story behind that .
your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother ' s birthday was last week .
i hadn ' t forgotten . i ordered some cloth but it didn ' t come in and i felt so bad if i would have come to her birthday without that , i just stayed at home .
does this mean a raise ?
it sure does .
i rode through a puddle , muddied your sash , the queen of america except there isn ' t one , i ' m in a hurry , and you were about to challenge me to a duel .
i was ?
god , i feel terrible . what if i was the last person he talked to before he died ?
i frankly wouldn ' t let it bother me . this guy had `` sky diver '' written all over him if you know what i mean .
you ' re pressuring yourself .
no . no .
<person> or <person> chocolate ?

come and get him .
this is the pricetag on the <number> s , the gates , the hangars , the routes , we got it all nailed right down to the typewriters .
. ' course the beauty of it is the overfunded pension fund . <person> gets the <number> million in there . fifty million buys him the minimum annuities for <number> , <number> employees and he walks away with the rest . all in , he ' ll net <number> to <number> million . not bad for a month ' s work . your man did his homework , <person> , you ' re gon na have the shortest executive career since the pope who got poisoned . now he ' ll really start believing he ' s `` <person> the great . ``
the guy on the phone .
what ' d he say ?
<person> ?
i could be wrong . what happened anyway ?
this is bullshit !
hey , <person> , listen -
<person> .
you can call me <person> . you ' re very brave to do this . you opened it .

if <person> comes here , he won ' t believe that i am out doing the `` meals on wheels '' .
not my face , my brain . it ' s enormous . i ' m the smartest guy in the village .
you ' re not even -- i ' m smarter than you !
in there . <continued_utterance> you have materials for the side bearings ?
i ' m using an old phonographic turntable .
because it struck me how neatly ' three ' went into the amount . two hundred ten thousand . that would mean i keep seventy .
that was our insurance company ' s recommendation .
hell no !
see . <person> ' t nothing i can do but keep him here beside me . that ' s where he belongs anyways . me and <person> , that ' s my dog , not anymore , but me and <person> we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes . he was just a pup then . a companion that ' s loyal , that ' ll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him . i miss him . i ' ll see ya later , unless i come across something worse .
he ' s still got that mgm-face .
you ' re still the only guy who ever traded movie-potential for police work .
we don ' t want to push her away . these are growing experiences .
how long have you known about this ? <continued_utterance> how long have you known ?
so one of them got to him .
maybe .
now ?
yes . now . <person> !
these ain ' t strangers , they ' re <continued_utterance> meaning these are the people you live amongst , you got a right to know if they ' re creeps . for instance , did you know there ' s a guy down the hall cheating on his wife ?
you picked that up on the scanner . we got ta move .
sure .
you forget about your troubles . you give up your worries . you drink from the wellspring of relaxation that enriches your soul . now i can ' t , at this time , give you the kind of therapeutic attention that you need to solve all your problems . know why ?

the only proof is those bodies .
what do we do with him ?
throw him in the lagoon .
<person> .
<person> .
well . i thought of calling your photographs `` pictures from a lost war '' . i ' m great at captions -- the new york editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell <person> was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance , got you a cover , me a feature , and packaged a class struggle in two words . <person> , eh ?

but it wasn ' t ! we got away ! we were walkin ' away !
they don ' t know that ! it was just you and me there . i ' ll say he raped me and you had to shoot him ! i mean , it ' s almost the truth !
that ' s weird . i never knew that .
the city ' s full of bad microwaves , bad thermals , bad electro-optics . you can ' t shield from it anymore . you can ' t get true readings . the whole industry moved out of the city years ago .
the tall man over there , <person> . i ' m not sure but i think that ' s <person> .
<person> ? oh , right , <person> .
i don ' t give a fuck about your parents --
we sometimes went downtown to score .
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that ' s my problem . if you don ' t feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you can ' t imagine .
i must be healthy , then , because i ' m scared to death . i guess i ' d better get back to <person> .
you ' re worried about every wrong thing <person> . <person> ' s tee ' ing you up to take a big fat fall-
-then we ' ll hold hands on the way down : look further up the street . the black buick . <continued_utterance> feds . they ' re all over this . you think i ' m the only one that burns ? two decades worth of twisted shit between your division and the biggest dope dealer in la ? <continued_utterance> i know i ' m going down <person> . that ' s the difference between you and me .
i wanted to talk to you . the other guys -
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but don ' t think we ' re friends . i ' m sorry , but i have other things -
how do you know <person> didn ' t eat it ? or norma ? or <person> ?

we ' re going to war , aren ' t we . if they ' re doing all that it must mean we ' re going to war .
you can ' t ask advice about the woman you ' re trying to hose from the woman you ' re trying to hose !
hose ? ! hose ? ! get your mouth outta the gutter ! this is a matter of the heart !
you should practice lying more often . you ' re awful at it . where to ?
<person> <number> . <number> is no longer bound by his programming .
shhhhhhh !

i never heard bad news and worse news . smart joke .
yeah . i like it .
knocking <person> in the water was awful . what if he hadn ' t known how to swim ?
but he did . i ' m not saying i was right , but <person> can do a lot of things no one thought he could do . <continued_utterance> look , i said i was wrong now i ' d like to forget it . i ' d like you all to accept my apology .

. preferably <person> .
`` by <person> ''

i always wanted to travel . i just never got the opportunity .

i ' m not talking about the crater .
he ' s promised us answers .
well . i ' m not sure -- what do you mean ? it ' s important to me . i guess . and like , to my , you know , the people who care about me .
but do you think it ' s important ?
<person> , but not now . <person> . you ' re trying to wipe out some old business . but not now . i understand . but you go call ' em back . you call the bishop back .
i have to try this case . i have to do it , <person> . i ' ve got to stand up for that girl . i need your help . <person> , will you help me . ? will you help me . ?

i ' m looking forward to it . <continued_utterance> why are you helping these raving psychotics .
a window onto the human condition ?
i prefer to think of it as a
you don ' t know what you want --
you don ' t either . take a look at yourself . maybe you ' re scared that someone might actually like you --
just listen to what <person> did to <person> ! she --
<person> , please ! we ' re trying to count !
there is no queen of america .
<person> , would you excuse me for a moment , i ' m going to kill him . now , where were we ?
i don ' t care who you dial , so long as it ' s not me . <person> - <continued_utterance> your new car .
- four wheel drive ?
really ? <person> , i suggest we look at your father ' s firing as a blessing in disguise .
how so ?
you were instructed to take <person> alive . do i have to remind you of the coroner ' s file-
-enough of your `sanderline ' bullshit . i ' ll checkmate with an admission of guilt to <person> himself .
almost . <person> to sit up ? what ' s the matter ?
nothing . i think i twisted my -- <continued_utterance> i have to tell you something . something . . hard .
<person> ?
you ' re just like her .
<person> , give it to him !
<person> always does it .
no .
what if you worked out everyday for six months ? you think you could beat him then ?
bad news .
people pay good money for that ?
no .
ask her .
you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose .
his leg is not good enough , sir .
you have to believe to have faith .
you don ' t believe in anything ?
your eminence , i ' ve been hearing some very troubling rumors about you .
there are so many to choose from . is it the one about my alleged alliance with <person> ? let ' s see if i remember it correctly . while the english attack from without , i ' ll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of france myself . that rumor , <person> ?
here we are ! <continued_utterance> <person> , hello there .
<person> . this is my editor , terry <person> .
a twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning .
did you confess ? <continued_utterance> your fingerprints were all over the bedroom .
the first day you lied to me --
i didn ' t lie to you --
it was so real .
here ' s the thing ; whenever you ' re having a nightmare , all you have to do is say <number> - <number> - <number> wake up ! you ' ll be out of it . you ' ll wake up .
i don ' t know . <person> ' t let on we know he ' s written . he ' ll start in i ' m only his housekeeper and that i found out through some chicanery or something .
how did you find out ?
you don ' t understand . i want to be surprised . astonish me , sport , new info , don ' t care where or how you get it , just get it . my wife tells me you put a move on <person> . here ' s some inside info for you . that <person> guy she ' s going with ' s got big bucks but he ' s putting her feet to sleep . <person> visas are imminent . so don ' t lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i ' ve never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . . an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . `` i like you sport , i ever tell you that .
. <person> .
i did ? <continued_utterance> i mean , of course i saved her life . she ' s almost my daughter , isn ' t she ?
let ' s get out of here before they come back .
not losing trust , are you ?
it ' ll be too dark to make our way back now . <person> ' s bed down for the night and head out at first light .
if there ' s gold . if !
you know what i ' m doing with my half ?
you ?
that ' s right , me .
what do you mean ? <continued_utterance> what are you going to do with me ?
get in the car .
and if no one comes to get them by night-time , then they belong to me .
<person> . <person> at me . you can not ride .
two-two , zed-three , one-five north ; a hundred fourteen degrees , five minutes , ten seconds east .
<person> .
maybe it ' s someone , or something , stalking us .
quit it .
huh . ?
see you , <person> .
shut-up camel .
well , what the hell . !
it ' s okay , don ' t bother , <person> .
i ' m sorry . thank you for the party .
vacation , <person> . everything you see is part of a vacation . every year , for one month , i bring my family to this house on vacation . nice , isn ' t it ?
it ' s wonderful . the lake . the trees . the little town .
i don ' t care , just get me there .
how about <person> ? you could take a local , arrives in two hours , and transfer in albuquerque . it ' ll get you across the border .
you see it ?
yes . it ' s . amazing . you want to get down here -- <person> . so much for little green men .
<person> ' t worry , <person> , no one knows i ' m here .
oh , yeah ? then how ' d you find my house ?
maybe .
you ' re still convinced there ' s a link to the department ?
oh yeah ? why don ' t we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
on come on , x . did you really think we were that barbaric ?
just on paper . <continued_utterance> <person> is to be removed from the city council race . the means and methods implemented to that end i will entrust to you .
you want me to torpedo <person> so your buddy bethune can win a city council seat uncontested-
i was playing a trick . i-i-i had a baseball .
what baseball ? where ' s a baseball ?
i know who shot <person> . i knew somebody was in the tower .
why didn ' t you tell the guerrillas ?
i ' ll be frank with you . this was his mother ' s idea . a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me .
it will be more than that , i can promise you .
<person> , she ' ll manage .
now it ' s back to the good life for us !
i ' ll wear it until you regain your senses . <continued_utterance> what ?
it suits you .
how about i pick one out for you ? <continued_utterance> you like <person> ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she don ' t put out no more new records .
cause she ' s dead .
goddamn it , it ' s obvious . it ' s the only option . that asshole , <person> . we can ' t let this drag out or we lose our shot .
bombing them .
<person> , second and third-degree .
how do you know ? you take a first aid course or something ?
thank you , no .
<person> well then . good day , <person> .
about the conspiracy ?
i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .
the beauty of existenz is that it changes every time you play it . it adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it . the result is that you have to play the game to find out why you ' re playing the game .
but that ' s kind of cheating , isn ' t it ? not to say confusing .
what ' s the matter ? . <person> ?
nothing .
uh , yes . it ' s very nice hair . <continued_utterance> she ' s hungry .
i know she ' s hungry . i tried to feed her but she wouldn ' t eat a thing . i ' m not a wet nurse .
<person> , honey , not murderer .
<person> , manslaughterer whos broke his parole and got in mind nothin but immoral purposes fars youre concerned .
come on , man . i almost had this thing open .
you ever think about it ? you ever worry ?
<person> , you know what ? this shit doesn ' t even taste good to me anymore .
ah , fuck ya then , you big pussy . what are you , spotting ?
would walter really press charges ?
it ' s within the realm . he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning .
with what ? against how many ?
we can ' t just sit here waiting to die .
you ' re saying you willed these events to happen ?
i don ' t know , i ' m very confused right now .
you know the man next door is near death . <continued_utterance> he must have gotten rid of those chickens . you don ' t hear them crowing anymore . i kind of miss it now .
<person> ' t blow that thing in here . you blow that thing when i ' m at work .
what ?
how do you know if you can get the upper hand ? how do you know if you ' re dealing with a guy who ' s in an inferior position to you , or superior position ? how do you know ?
the white dot ; light in the dark . <continued_utterance> maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
it ' s giving .
hey , bacon boy , it ' s <person> .
<person> , ya little prick , where are ya ?
. and everyone lived happily ever after .
sort of .
no . it ' s not a legal fee . it ' s a personal fee .
for what ?
that ' s right , <person> . you better be afraid . i told you it wasn ' t over , but you didn ' t listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
i wasn ' t sneaking around with your girl . would you please tell him ?
you have good instincts when it comes to things like that ?
like what ?
what is that to you . ?
what would you like it to be to me . ? i , i , i can ' t invest in failure .
i was hoping that was just one crazy guy .
did you hear the way he screamed at me ? he wasn ' t alone .
<person> , i ' m not as dumb as my hair makes me look .
they ain ' t all strictly minor league . one of ' em pays almost two grand ! <continued_utterance> now wait , <person> . you got ta do the math , and you got ta look at how good i ' m playing . i hit the shot of the tournament at the best-ball . they put it on national tv .
ms . <person> , you wanted to see me ?
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . under the authority vested in me by the president , i ' m giving you temporary reassignment .
two days . heading out early sunday .
well , if you move at a decent clip , you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow . should still give you time to take it all in and make it down .
oh god , <person> .
well , why not ?
you know we got ta dumbwaiter for that . <continued_utterance> not that one . <person>-o here .
<person> , har , har .
oh . right . ha . <person> , about last night . there is something i need to tell .
are you limping ? why are you limping ?
there ' s a penalty for any material returned to the trans-border library with sticky pages . <continued_utterance> hey , you can ' t do that ! ! he can ' t do that ! !
sure he can .
<person> , i couldn ' t resist . but you know . i do feel the urge to kill someone here .
who ?
i give you the body of <person> , head of lapd ' s <person> . proof of a <number> -year criminal collusion between his department and <person> and my testimony to link the dots . then i leave la for good .
what happened to <person> ?
are you drinking . professor tripp ? right now .
no .
take a look at this , <person> .
are you fucking crazy ? you just gave them forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free ? !
what was here , mr . <person> ?
a trailer was here . what the hell do you think ?
oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee !
oh-oh- cu - <person> crying - speaks -
no , i ' m too hot now .
you better be careful . you ' ll get a stroke arguing .
you ' re pretty full of yourself , aren ' t you ?
i like that about me , beautiful .
that ' s dumb . a little funny , though . how come your dad never comes to meetings with you ?
i don ' t have a dad . <person> did . i sprang full-blown from my mother ' s forehead . you want to walk home with me and <person> ?
well , what did i do on <person> that they have to keep me from telling ?
i ' ve no idea . i just work here .
this is no fun .
why didn ' t you dive ?
<person> , utah . <person> effective immediately . <continued_utterance> i already gave <person> my letter of resignation .
you can ' t quit , <person> .
i don ' t trust the driver !
you drive , idiot !
that was about as grim as it gets .
the guy was history when he killed <person> . you knew that .
you really mean that ? what ' d he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without <person> ' s money and seal of approval , i ' m not such a hot investment anymore . you ' re just the best money can buy , <person> .
you ' re not exactly pure <person> , you went after <person> with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before .
oh , yeah , i know where that is . all right . if the guy calls again , try to keep him on the line for at least a minute so we can trace the call .
but he never stays on that long ! sometimes he hangs up after just a couple of seconds .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! <person> away !
what happened ? <continued_utterance> what ? you robbed the store ? you robbed the <person>damn store ? !
the worst , the worst -- i could never , under any circumstances , love anybody who had a sailboat .
neither could i .
oh , i ' m not feeling at all well . you see , it ' s very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back . mcu -- <person> --
oh , dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable . <person> ' t you get down ?
neither .
you mean both .
the officers told me to wait here . i ' ve been sitting here for over two hours .
i think they forgot about you . <continued_utterance> what happened to you , anyway ?
what happened to your face ?
i ' m not talking to you anymore .
come sit by me . <continued_utterance> i dont know that this is the right place for us .
it aint gon na be forever , peanut .
i ' m sorry . ?
her doctors murdered her . they gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life . her doctors murdered her .
no . shes fine . back home .
whatll it be ? the regular ? <person> ?
<person> , what did you get ?
are you ready for this ?
this . isn ' t . . possible !
sure it is - and it ' s all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and <person> . <continued_utterance> tastes different , somehow . <continued_utterance> i think i ' m going to like it here .
<person> .
i mean , how can that be ? it just happened that way ? and i ' m not even getting into the fruits . i ' m just dealing with vegetables right now . with all those things coming out of the earth , there must be a god .
yeah .
you can stop looking . there was no coke . i ' ve been in l . a . county with a guy they
no , leave one . somebody ' s grandmother might want one .
and while you ' re at it , i ' ll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads .
so then there ' s more talk about the wind . while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous . and when you finally get back , you have to clean up the boat .
why don ' t people have boat maids ?
this isn ' t about you , <person> . they ' re doing this to me .
they ' re not doing this , <person> . i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi . when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau . i felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . but it hasn ' t turned out that way . and now , if i were to be transferred to omaha , or <person> or some field office where i ' m sure i could rise , it just doesn ' t hold the interest for me it once did . not after what i ' ve seen and done .
<person> ! did this man rape you ?
<person> ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can i go home ?
can ' t you have a normal conversation ?
i don ' t want to have any conversation .
c ' mon , give the guy a break . at least we ' ve seen him fight before .
i remember him , too . i remember him being very unmemorable .
that ' s not true . it ' s just that <person> drives me crazy . she knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad .
<person> , it was a great party , everyone had a good time .
<person> , <person> . <person> doin ' ?

damn . <person> na be another hot one today . sometimes i don ' t even want to get out of bed . course don ' t want to get out for the cold one ' s neither . then of course the clouds come in .
<person> , <person> , i ' ve got places to be .
i ' m sure it is , <person> : and let me tell you something . if we find it so complex , how in the hell you think you ' re going to make a jury understand it ? see my point ? let ' s talk a minute . <person> : what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ?
my client can ' t walk , your honor .
yeah . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s your cash .
what about the stuff ?
we can ' t afford that !
<person> ' t you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .
i ' d really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement . ok ?
i ' ll do my best . !
you can call me <person> again . <person> said <person> sounds too pretentious .
<person> is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?
<person> . i ' ll walk you to your door .
no , i live just around the corner .
they ' re trying to divide us on this , <person> . we can ' t let them .
they have divided us , <person> . they ' re splitting us up .
he loved her .
he killed her . it seemed like the same thing after a while . <continued_utterance> good . more for me .

well , sure , we can leave it up .
yeah !

helen , there ' s a double agent in my outfit . i don ' t know who . there ' s no one i can trust . except you . can you get away ?
orders are - not nobody ! not nohow ! <continued_utterance> he ' s in conference with himself on account of this . <continued_utterance> . trouble with the witch . and even if he wasn ' t you wouldn ' t have been able to see him anyway on account of nobody has - not even us in the palace !
oh , but -- but please . it ' s very important .
maybe . i ' m feeling a little sad myself tonight .
you mean , with your wife leaving you and ail ? <person> mentioned something about it . about a note .
because they ' re very well-funded raving psychotics , and i ' m getting a lot of money . <continued_utterance> you think i care about their cause ? or yours ? not at all . <person> , america is on top now . . . but so was rome , once . all civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and . living well takes money .
you ' re damaged goods , lady .
<person> great . what will that be ?
we ' re just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar . acoustic .
did i ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell ? he didn ' t want nobody ' s opinion but his own . <continued_utterance> he ' s going to check out heaven first . he gets a round trip ticket to heaven . he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home . people dripping with sweat , working in the fields , hardly surviving . he asked a man who was getting a drink of water , `` i thought the streets were paved with gold . `` `` they are but you won ' t see them , '' he said . `` boy , you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness . `` so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell . he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back , picking their teeth . `` man , this is a dream . `` he asked , `` what ' s you ' ll doing ? '' they all hollered back , `` sinning . `` the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said , `` please to meet you . `` he asked , `` i thought you ' ll was supposed to be burning in fire . `` <person> said , `` man , ain ' t no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins . `` the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth .
i don ' t want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell .
you know this is adultery . you burn in hell for that .
then let ' s make sure we get our <person> ' s worth
<person> . you kill that <person> , otherwise hes gon na turn my baby against me .
<person> at me . theres no turning back on this . im gon na kill <person> .
long story .
<person> looked real skeezed this morning . like he was on a dope jag .
his mother needs a piece of his hair . it ' s for the keeping of the souls ceremony . has to be kept for four days .
keeping of the souls . do they still burn their dead or something ?
the broad has disappeared .
the hospital . ?
well , we ' ll look for it real hard later . let me talk to mommy .
<person> . <person> , daddy .
<person> --
are you okay ?
i need you to pick up the cake tomorrow .
<person> ' t we already have someone to do that for us ?
tell them he was trying to save the young boy ' s life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .
of what ?
meaning ?
meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger .
<person> , real funny . you ' re wrong about this , i could get busted on the spot .
trust me , the guy ' s dirty . he ' ll like it . especially the part about offing me . now get out of here . go make yourself a new friend .
i don ' t know . you ' re about his size . that ' s all .
you don ' t know what your own boyfriend looks like ?
<person> , i ' m goin ' home . to bed . my nice warm bed .
we can do it right here .
that ' s true . <person> , maybe i am gay .
<person> ' t be retarded . we were doing research for our girlfriends .
um . <person> .
st . <person> ? you ' re making that up .
well -- maybe it would ' ve been better if you had . <continued_utterance> i mean -- look , i don ' t mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation , whatever it is , but i ' m just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions , they might end up having a lot less trouble generally . that ' s all .
hey , that ' s what i ' ve been trying to tell you guys at the bank .
there ' s someone in the house . grace <continued_utterance> relax baby . <person> here .
<person> , don ' t go out there . call the sheriff .
it ' s all right . it ' s all right . we ' re <person> boys , yeah ?
yeah .
what ?
at the seven-eleven .
<person> , thank you . thanks for everything . but i ' ve got to go .
but you can ' t . <continued_utterance> see . <person> , you don ' t have any clothes on . and besides that , <person> wants to talk to you when you feel better .
of course i don ' t want to ! but it ' s got rungs . <person> ' t be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym . big fat repair guys do it all the time , right ? right ?
but you ' re forgetting one thing .
mr . <person> : why did you name this boat the sea dolphin ii ?
actually , my first choice was ' no comment . ' so if someone asked where i was , i could truthfully respond ' no comment . ' over there .
no .
figgers . there ' s a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun ? deduct it . <person> pulls the hundred back from <person> ' s grasp . darrell don ' t know nothing about no gun . <continued_utterance> course you don ' t . tell me something <person> . forty thousand people die every day ! how come none of them are you ? darrell i think you know where to find her . <continued_utterance> and the trunk key . darrell topped off the tank for you . no charge . just my way of doing business . bobby listen up good , <person> . i ' m getting outta this shithole . you ' re staying ! and one little peep outta you -- remember that gun makes you part of the food chain . your prints are all over it . i ' d be awful careful whose rectum i was pointing my finger in , <person> . <person> hops in the car , a free man . as <person> glares at him , bewildered and frightened at the same time .
do what ?
ya know . `` it '' .
what you gon na do ? <continued_utterance> maybe a taste . <continued_utterance> feed this to you like a little bird .
<person> ' t --
<person> . how long will it take ?
<person> ' t make me angry , <person> .
you ' re perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i ' m with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help .
i ' m not interested . i ' ve already got a job .
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
you always got the best of it around here and when <person> always talks about my son , it is always you , so you fix the roof .
<person> part ?
all of it . that he tried to rape me .
i ' m fine , <person> , please . if you could call now .
you want to lose this leg ? cause that ' s what you ' re risking . soon as we ' re done , i ' ll call . <person> ? <continued_utterance> bite down on this . i ain ' t gon na lie . <person> pain about to hit you sweetheart .
<person> !
you <person> and your guns .
i bet you were surprised . !
um -- a little .
no , i ' m not saying that , but i ' m beginning to give god more thought .
so , what did you do ? have some kind of religious experience ?
shoot <person> in the head with a gun . now im beginning to get it . you want me to shoot <person> in the head with a gun .
yes .
i just told you -- he hit a deer .
i hear nothing . not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart . i think that ' s the way it goes .
you mean ever ? <continued_utterance> but that ' s grotesque .
<person> , you can get it doggie-style or you can get it laying on your side -- those are your only choices . this is my house , and i get to say . wherever mcginty sits is the head of the table , you know ?
i have become . the nightmare you once thought me to be .
but not before . not us .
i wasn ' t trying --
is that bubble what i think it is ? mary ' s parents nod . police officer but . how . how ' d you get the zipper all the way to the top ?
um . <person> . i ' m broke . i got ta get back to worcester tomorrow . i got this girl there , and she ' s kind of in a bad situation . ? i just need to borrow some money . whatever you can spare . i ' ll pay you back . i ' ll pay you back , man .
i really wish <person> was here .
does he have a gun ?
no .
i have bad news for you .
no . ! <continued_utterance> great . what are we supposed to do now ?
something ' s wrong !
i ' m gon na unport you now . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to cut you free !
that so ? you want to tell me what , if any , real thoughts you had lately ?
what you have to get personal about so quick ? all i mean is you could possibly read a book . <continued_utterance> whats that honey ?
it ' s her decision and she ' s decided not to tell people -- at least for now .
how -- how long does she have ?
well , i ' m not sure , but i think <person> is now a princess .
em , you want to open your presents ? <continued_utterance> this an awfully big box .
what ' s wrong ?
i don ' t know , doesn ' t make any sense . i almost can ' t look at you . like it hurts .
more or less .
<person> , they ' re young . they ' re probably newlyweds .
of course .
. so it ' s in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us . . this gives you limited power of attorney for mr . <person> ' s account . every trade you make is at your discretion . every ticket you buy must be marked `` power of attorney . `` that means you call the shots and mr . <person> has no official knowledge of what stocks you ' re buying . sign here and here .
this is turning out great .
what ' s that mean ?
no , i mean why are you doing it ?
what ? oh , because i ' m his guardian .
we ' re not stranded . we ' ve got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back .
then lets go back while we still can .
you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife .
you fucking bastard !
why me ?
call it penance .
i take it things didn ' t much work out the way you planned .
i ' m still here , aren ' t i ? see this ? <continued_utterance> all this nothing ? it doesn ' t get to <person> like it gets to me . he says he don ' t mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
you act like an idiot , you look fine .
you said you ' d get me a new uniform .
did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away ?
should i have ?
name ' s norm . i live up in pompano with my folks .
oh jesus .
goddamn him ! he really could have called me !
are you pissed off ' cause she ' s gone ?
i am sure you ' ve heard a number of tall tales , myths and legends about mr . <person> i can assure you gentlemen , most of them are true .
who ' s <person> ?
say you ' re sorry .
<person> that .
do you think the rabbit did it ?
i don ' t wan na think . i wan na drink .
her -- her name is <person> .
that ' s right . what ' s she doing ?
what about <person> ?
what about him ? i told him i don ' t train with people i don ' t know .
soon as i rest a bit . i meant as soon as we are back to normal again , anytime .
here i am thinking about myself when poor <person> is resting on the floor of the kitchen .
thanks , healy . <person> work .
<person> ? <person> ' t you want the name of the housing project ?
she is . unable to have any more children .
i ' m sorry . please give her my best .
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain ' s deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she ' s in the state she ' s in today .
now , dr . <person> ' s testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
you tricked me , damn you !
take it easy .
what is it you want me to do ?
a small thing . nothing really .
who ?
to <person> ! !
no .
. i don ' t want anyone to have a crack at you .
you think i ' m crazy but it ' s all true .
maybe you crazy and it ' s true , my friend .
and that ' s a good way to be . in fact , i ' m kind of surprised a pretty girl like you is sleeping alone anyway . i would ' ve thought guys would be lined up at the door .
i don ' t like men .
<person> , it ' s rather simple . those risks that you love to take on the golf course , the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about -- you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion .
i should ask this woman out .
you know <person> is in attica ?
he didn ' t have my lawyer .
maybe it ' s me , but i ' m beginning to like it .
yes , sir . yes , sir !
<person> , it ' s <person> . <person> you ' re there . you won ' t believe what ' s happened .
could you hold on a minute , honey ? <continued_utterance> how ' bout we get the hell out of here ?
<person> , you don ' t know what you are talking about . quit trying to hold on so tight . i ' m gone . long gone like a turkey through the corn .
you ' re not a turkey . a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth .
hot dog , bub ?
sure .
you know . take the pictures ?
i remember the first time you walked into mrs . <person> ' s class in <number> nd grade . <person> gingham dress .
we ' re in no hurry . i think we ' ll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids .
take your time . i wish i had .
my god , what in hell happened here ?
come on , copper . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> ! ! ! <continued_utterance> norwegian of the month , <person> . harmless .
i don ' t know .
you got a nasty side to your thought process .
i peeked . <continued_utterance> it really had the makings , <person> . there was a lot to admire . i ' ve . never read anything quite like it .
you ' re not just trying to make me feel better ? crabtree looks directly at grady , his old friend .
we ' ll call you . <continued_utterance> well , it ' s been a real blast , <person> . i bid you good evening .
where you going ?
alright . i changed my mind . i ' ll have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side , please .
yeah !
as much as you used to ?
no . much more .
will you spare my life ?
i can ' t .
is that where you come from - st . <person> ? it dawns on him , slowly . he shows no emotion .
no . you come from st . <person> .
i ' m <person> , dad . how ' s arnold ? can you get me his autograph ?
sigmund .
i understand .
he said something like , `` do you want it dirty <number> '' or something . i tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .
we keep going , that ' s what we do . we ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
<person> ! how many of them are there ?
weena .
how do you spell that ?
how ' re you doing in there ?
fine .
what ' d you do ?
i said `` <person> , wrong room '' and walked away .
<person> !
stop .
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . i don ' t know where .
<person> is smart enough to know you ' d check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he ' s probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
i didn ' t take her . she took me .
you lead an exciting life , mr .
he ' s upset . i don ' t blame him . it ' s weird that she just shows up like that . and of course she ' s late , the druggie .
<person> . can you stop , please ?
i don ' t know . send the money i guess .
maybe you should stay home for a little while , <person> .
from your lips , to <person> ' s ears .
you go first .
<person>ing the ambulance .
why ? why ? she ' s dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?
no . can you not answer my phone anymore ?
yeah . ok . i can do that . i ' m sorry .
maybe i just live here , what do you think about that ?
can i ask you where you were the night <person> was murdered ?
about six and a half million dollars .
your turn to pay . <continued_utterance> king dong ! that ' s you , <person> ! <continued_utterance> it worked ! we screwed the bitch !
so now you ' ve got to talk him out of it . and then we ' ve got to figure out an acceptable political solution .
and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution ?
this is the perfect time to panic ! i ' m lost , <person> is gone , they ' re going to move from their house in two days and it ' s all your fault ! !
my fault ? ! if you hadn ' t pushed me out of the window in the first place --
yes .
new york has the best doctors and hospitals in the country .
<person> you wouldn ' t understand . i ' m not sure i exactly understand . what are we going to do ?
i ' ll take <person> to find rafael -- we ' ll go to sebaco on the road to matagalpa -- the guardia heavily control the area and they ' re scared right now -- they ' ll never let us through . we won ' t be able to get near rafael . <person> will understand -- and we ' ll turn around and drive back without a story .
a warning shot will be fired across its bow .
and what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot ?
<person> was my second cousin , peckerwood . i wouldn ' t drink that with my gun hand .
<person> lake . one-time velvet voiced crooner . but a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the hands of none other than <person> .
that ' s what i am .
and it ' s over . ?
you know where she is ?
no , i don ' t .
<person> . i ' m marked for death and they send me on the road with a pr nerd .
<person> ! <person> for death !
today .
<person> .
we kidnapped <person> out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ?
<person> is a criminal .
we ' re fine , <person> . how are you ? i mean --
<person> .
that is called a crab apple switch . it ' s for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i don ' t know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk ' s stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down <person> and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was <person> . my daddy taught both of us to play but <person> was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named <person> sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . <person> had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl ' s room and he wouldn ' t stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
<person> ' t pick up the cards if you are not in the game . did he die ?
what do you mean ?
<person> saw crayons as phallic symbols . when i asked for skinny crayons , it was a personal assault on his manhood .
oh , <person> .
i hope you wasn ' t pettin ' him none , was you ?
i want you out by six thirty . understand . <person> comes at seven , i want you out by six thirty .
sure . would you like something for sleep ?
oh , i been a lotta different places . um . i went down to florida for a while . i was doing some work in orlando . i ' ve been all over the place .
well . i just wish you would have let me know you were ok .
<person> , have you ever seen my hands so steady ? have you ?
i ' m going inside .
-- <person> was an apple , that ' s right . red on the outside , white on the inside . and <person> hated him . kicked his ass a coupla times . but he didn ' t kill him .

<person> called me last night looking for you .

i can ' t stay here .
what ? oh , because i ' m his guardian .

i ' m getting a little hungry . i ' ve got a headache as it is . just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in .
<person> .
we find that your subscription lapsed .
you mean you don ' t know who she is ?

w-w-w-we ?

i don ' t want to listen to this again .
if we made a trade , we ' d be giving in to extortion , and nat<person> would never trust us again . we ' ll get clobbered in world opinion .
change my mind ? ? ? oh <person> , please . please be happy .
i will . i promise . as soon as i stop being terrified . <continued_utterance> i ' m so tired .
you guess ? did he or didn ' t he ?
yeah . okay . he did
me , too .
<person> . now , so he ' s in jail . he , finally , he gets to see the light , he calls up <person> , he says he thinks he made a mistake . as if by magic , charges against him are dropped , he ' s released from jail . p . s . he ' s fired from the firm , his wife divorces him , he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years . you like that story ?
you must be wearing a mask you ' re laughing so hard behind it <person> . <person> ' s cut the `` sir '' crap . correct me if i ' m wrong , but when you took cnx electronics , you laid off <number> , <number> workers , <person> about <number> , <number> , that airline .
i could break you , mate , in two pieces over my knees , you know it , i know it , i could buy you six times ever , i could dump the stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares . i ' m announcing a tender offer at <number> tomorrow , and i ' m expecting your commitment .
can you fix it ?
not unless you have a welding rig in all that shit of yours . and even if you did , it wouldn ' t matter .
you look great .
thanks . she notices something . mary what ' s that ?
we ' ll see you in calais !
or hell !
where ' s this girl now ?
<person> ' t show up for work last night . called a friend of hers , a waitress that works here too , said she was at bido lito ' s in hollywood . said she was `hiding out . '
oh . well . that ' s all right . !
. i ' m kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts . it ' s a long and worthy story but i won ' t trouble you with it right now .
people live up here ?
we have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home . most of `em are friendly . respect their land and they ' ll respect you .
should have blown already . <person> fuse , that ' s <person> stuff .
maybe that ' s all the iraqis could afford , okay ? maybe they got it on discount . maybe the fuse is messed up . or maybe it ' s going to go off in two seconds , and we won ' t have to worry about getting <person> down off there , all we ' ll have to worry about is finding the pieces . behind them , pathetically , <person> cries:
they just stole my entire life ' s work . i really don ' t have anything left to lose .
but you ' re clever . far more clever than anyone else in this realm .
yeah , maybe , a little .
why is that ? <continued_utterance> you can talk to us , <person> . that ' s why we ' re here .
he couldn ' t do it , even on the sofa .
god , that thing of his must be psychic . he didn ' t masturbate ?
we ' re gon na pull this off , <person> .
oh , my <person> ! <person> ' t stop !
you don ' t have to apologize . you ' re journalists .
and you ' re a businessman ?
you think i ' m after money ? i told you , my friend . <person> . time for a change . <person> is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
so all by yourself , you ' re going to destroy every government ; in the world .
i can ' t know things if you don ' t tell me .
<person> came to the play .
that ' s absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
i know what i saw -
who ?
teresa .
have you asked her out ?
she ' s seeing a guy . i don ' t know how serious it is , but the guy ' s a real horse ' s ass , in my opinion .
<person> ' t matter ! he ' s already dead !
what the hell are you talking about ?
that ' s crazy talk .
i defy any and all limits .
our friends . my work .
the job ' s real -- you ' ve had is six weeks -- since you got back from <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s all a fabrication , <person> .
so it ' s the rockettes , so what ?
and you ' re just sitting there like that ?
i ' ll take that under advisement . maybe i can be like you and lose a leg for the old stars and <person> . i bet the flag ' s a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs .
one twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus . believe me , mr . x , i ' ve put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and i don ' t feel the urge to stop just yet . so think carefully before you tell me : is `` kiss my ass , hop- along '' your final answer ?
in this weather ?
bennings ?
<person> ?
what ?
g ' damn , price , you tuna sucking piece of raw meat -- whatchyou goin ' to zambeze for ?
thought i ' d get some great shots of your head gettin ' blown to smithereens .
i think it ' s sort of writing itself at this point .
<person> , <person> always swore you were working , but --
i agree . if there has been a coup , and there ' s a hard-line government in power now , then it doesn ' t matter what we say . the end of the day we ' ll either agree to their terms , they ' ll agree to ours , or we ' ll go to war . but what if there hasn ' t been a coup ? what if . what if what is happening is a series of accidents ?
the second letter is an accident ?
they would ?
um-hmm .
<person> no !
lost my eyes in vyee-et-nam . lost them fighting the commies . fought the war and lost my eyes fightin ' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me .
maybe .
oh god , <person> .
well , <person> --
. but it ' s always really good to know that wherever i am , whatever stupid shit i ' m doing , you ' re back at my home , rooting for me .
we can horsetrade with <person> on ships . but it doesn ' t get us any closer to removing those missiles .
<person> to hope it ' s a signal that he ' ll back down on the real issue too .
andlt ; andlt ; <person> ' t be stupid . andgt ; andgt ;
he says the hair is longer and lighter .

<person> , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . i wake up drugged to find what ? you ' ve got a `` salesman '' over here reading a three week old newspaper . he ' s pulling a <number> with a `` trucker '' , who happens to be packing a cop issue handk <number> mm . i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how ' s that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i `` walked '' in ? and if that ' s true , why ' d they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money ? then i notice how beefy they both are . <person> , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . ergo they ain ' t strangers and this isn ' t what it seems . that ' s how i knew yo-yo wouldn ' t get a round off even if i gave him all day . why ? <continued_utterance> cuz there ' s nothing but blanks in these guns . and no offense , but their performances were terrible .
not bad . not bad at all . have a seat . <continued_utterance> most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . i expected you to do the same .

i ' ll be a laughing stock !
no you won ' t . you ' ve blow this way out of proportion , <person> , and you have to get control . now try your breathing .
and no one will know the truth .

everyone ' s very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity .
as we discussed , you get a car if the car has to be kept overnight .

so far , i agree .
<person> or later what those boys realize , is that the girls you ' re chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him . <continued_utterance> so i guess what you should ask yourself is : how far are you willing to go ?
i have some excellent brandy here . would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the cardinal ?

not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .
you didn ' t see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , didn ' t you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target .
why would you think that ?
she knows everything . she has flawless taste . she ' s famous for it . the salesmen swear by her . if she likes it , it sells . <person> .

the old place sure looks more crowded with people in it .
<person> , do you know <person> ?
yeah , i sent you pictures . here ' s what i ' m thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it ' s swimming up the potomac .

you ' ve got no jurisdiction .
you got no know-how . about indian way . or about jack <person> for that matter .
like you protected <person> ?
i see where you ' re going with that , but if i could just say something , which is basically that a guy like <person> is so autocratic he doesn ' t know how to let himself be helped ; it ' s a point of pride to take every bullet , no matter who fired it , or whether it was even aimed at him , which personally i think it very self-defeating . now , don ' t get me wrong , he ' s a man of enormous integrity , but there ' s a political component to this job that the general just didn ' t have any patience for .
if the missiles do not become operational , if you remove the missiles , then there will be no war . at this moment , the president is accepting the terms of secretary <person> ' s letter of friday night . if the soviet union halts construction immediately , removes the missiles , and submits to u . n . inspection , the united states will pledge to never invade <person> or aid others in that enterprise .

mr . <person> , please . i ' m sorry about this .
what ?
little village down seven . supposed to be charming .
then aren ' t we going in the wrong direction ?
well , i figure if you take a state policeman , shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk , it ' s best to just get on out of the state if you can .
that is a complete and bloody outrage . it ' s the lad ' s horse , sir , from devon . he raised him up from a pup , he did . trained him right up to the day when the army came to town .
these aren ' t my orders , sergeant . <continued_utterance> you ' ll have to take him to market . that ' s all .
yes . that you would provide a free set of storm windows with the sale of aluminum siding .

<person> , in this pod is the only , the original version of existenz , an entire game system that cost thirty-eight million to develop , not including pre-release marketing costs . and i ' m locked outside of my own game ! i can ' t get it out , or me in !
are you serious ? this is the only version that exists ?
not that . <person> at what i wrote down cause i cant say it .
its okay by me , peanut .
my hunch is it was <person> . he always was after <person> ' s property .
<person> ? does he wear pants this color ?
here -- come on .
what was that ?
we should bomb <person> .
it ' s not their fault . the truth is , the world is just . different .
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . <person> ' t you , <person> ?
i put up new drapes , jake .
you and your pep talks .
<person> ' t get me wrong . we can salivate over all the christy malones of our lives . wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon . but we ' re strictly hamburger guys . ground chuck , sixty eight percent lean , is about the best we can hope for .
why ?
i don ' t know <person> .
oh god . he ' s back . i ' m sorry . please forget that i . i don ' t know what i ' m saying . please .

she ' s in the desert . she ' s out in the desert .
not sure yet - <continued_utterance> the shinjuku . japanese troop carrier . world war ii .
<person> ' s make another pass .
i defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .
that ' s crazy talk .
i just wanted to test it first .
no ! change me back into a sor- ceress , <person> .
when it ' s warm .
<person> , maybe .
<person> , we haven ' t seen each other in twelve years . <person> ' t make me wait another day . <person> seems touched by this .

can i have two , <person> ?
yeah , you can have two halves , just like everyone else .
yeah , well i think she heard that i ' m a lawyer and i have a family and that was good enough .
for how long ?
that doesn ' t matter , your team sucks . plus i even look more like a coach then <person> .
<person> , that ' s not really value added .
it ' s just a souvenir . they don ' t even make the caps anymore .
<person> . i know a gun when i see one . and that ' s a gun .
just felt like it .
so let me ask you something , <person> . how good are you ?
i ' ll try to be more careful .
s ' matter with you ? you look like you ' re fading .
my man ? you told <person> you ' d <person> those men . do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man ? you ' re just a dirty little fixer .
you whore ! you filthy whore !
yes it does . the fairy queen told me .
the fairy queen ? and the baby here ' s a princess ? and these two rodents are your guides ? <continued_utterance> yeah well . in the morning i think i ' ll be on my way .
i ' m more <person> .
what ' s that mean ?
he wanted me to live .
why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why '
-he was screaming about `set-ups , ' and about how a `cop ' killed <person> -- he thought i was you <person> . the gray <person> that gunned him down showed up three minutes after my dispatch call .
-so cops killed him too , is that the kind of bullshit you wa-
you mean to do any knitting in the near future ?
the feeling comes and goes .
it belonged to my father .
your father . <continued_utterance> well now it belongs to me . i collect swords . i take them from the men i kill .
i need an address on a guy named <person> , <person> <person>-
-what about <person> ?
looks like you guys have a lot of bang-bang down here , eh ? little misunderstanding between the poets and the government ?
`` misunderstanding ? ! '' `` down here '' it ' s called a war . it started in nineteen thirty . before you were born .
not much . he knows i don ' t have the highest opinion of him . and he knows i don ' t want to see him or know anything about him , ever . but i tried to keep it kind of neutral . <person> . i could go into a lot more detail , believe me .
well . it ' s an interesting problem . but i don ' t really know what to tell you . it ' s a little outside my personal field of expertise .
<person> was supposed to be framed , not killed . what i ' m telling you is , i don ' t like surprises .
<person> cloud has a silver lining , partner . here ' s to no loose ends . he raises his glass in a toast .
i can ' t .
i ' m gon na teach you .
i tried to warn you in the bar . i told you to exercise control , that it all depended on your mind . all of this , everything is your creation . and we ' re now heading toward your true moment , of choice .
`` true moment of choice ? ''

well , right now it ' s gon na be your funereal .
dolores .
lem me guess . your cousin from des moines ?
no --
here ' s what i ' m taking him in -- so he can ' t attack me again .
that ' s fine for you . but do i go back and say i interviewed <person> ? do i go back and say i missed the biggest story of the war ? or do i say <person> was stone cold dead -- that ' s the information , isn ' t it ? or do i say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol ' revolutionary campfire ? can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was . sympathetic ? journalists don ' t fall in love . which story do you want me to tell ?
do what you want to do .
wish i could say the same . what ' re you doin ' here , <person> ?
work ' s been slow for me since the cartoons went to color . but i still got it , <person> . ' boop boop be-doop ' .
you ' re a good one to give advice . you ' re sitting on the steps , locked out of your house because you can ' t pay your taxes , and you ' re going to give me advice on life ?
i ' m not giving you a divorce , and that ' s it . i ' m looking out for your welfare . no divorce . <continued_utterance> it ' s for your own benefit , and you ' ll thank me for it .
that ' s a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law ' s a nurse . what did you do , stop ?

<person> it , bb ! did you sign them ?
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning expos changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .

i don ' t want <person> , i need <person> ! <continued_utterance> look , there seems to be some confusion . you see , dr . <person> , uh , <person> , wanted me to call him but i lost his number .
esthetics are subjective , aren ' t they , <person> ? i ' m <person> <person> . if you ever need me .
thanks , <person> , for the good work . you have a good eye for detail .

you like the rifle , <person> ? ' <person> , ' i mean .
do you want me to cancel the troupe coming ?
no , no . <person> ' s go through the gesture . if you had been on the titanic when it went down , you wouldn ' t ' ve been satisfied just to sink into the ocean . you ' d have done a swan dive into it . with me on your back !

you always got something to say .
i ' ll be around .
sure .
stay with him .
i don ' t know .
i ' m listening .
<person> ' s see . you are , by your dress and by your manner , members of a bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to his eminence the cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before .
yup .
doing the bachelor party thing ?
are you trying to talk us into having them removed ?
no , no . in fact , you would be useless to us without them . we realists are forbidden to have them , and so we have to use people like you on occasion .
yeah , your father was good at all that stuff . he knew everything about the woods , everything about fishing , everything about hunting and everything about cars . if he wasn ' t such a pain in the ass he would ' ve been a lot of fun to be around .
maybe he ' s nicer now .
he came to see me .
he came to see you ?
not this week .
<person> .
i see , well this happens to be a nocturne .
a which ?
<person> ' t you going to watch with me ?
i ' ve got some final preparations to take care of checking his watch , he stops suddenly .
but you just said it hasn ' t really moved .
that ' s correct .
oh , yeah . go ahead . <continued_utterance> i ' m glad i didn ' t have to kill you . i ' m glad it didn ' t come to that .
yeah . well , me too .
<person> ? and where are your parents ?
it ' s just my mother and me . she ' s back in columbus . she couldn ' t come .
no way .
i ' ll tell him . he deserves to know .
no , <person> , you said the first part . i said all the rest .
whatever .
you agree with a lot of what he says , don ' t you .
i know where he ' s coming from . the only thing i really don ' t get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
how do i know that ? how about it , pretzel-man ? what ' s your story ?
his name is <person> . i thought you guys knew him . mcmanus verbal ?
<person> . ok . but the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures . according to these figures , you ' re upside down on your mortgage --
you said that three times already . i get that . but i ' m asking you if there ' s something else you can do . not the bank , you . can you shift things around , restructure --
she ' s left the room before . she always came back . <person> nods . considers this .
so . i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other , and have this baby , right ? <person> .
he ' s a research doctor . you ' re dad ' s a doctor , too --
what kind of research ?
how ? supportive letters from prison while i ' m being kicked out of our home ? do you have any idea what is happening out here ? our credit cards are maxed . the people at the bank , you should see their faces when i walk in there . i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien . our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging . <person> will help us . <person> will take us in . <person> wants anything to do with us . so tell me , <person> , how you ' re gon na make it up to me . tell me again how we ' ll get through this , and maybe while you ' re at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection .
<person> --
your parents would be crushed to think you weren ' t happy with it .
they ' re not my parents , <person> . my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much .
still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .

<person> told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago . <person> with <person> at universal . he thought he was humoring me . until i got it . they offered me the role . there in the room . so <person> , who i ' m sure never thought in a million years i ' d land that part , makes some phone calls and just like that they don ' t want me anymore . nobody calls now . i can ' t get in to see any studio casting people . he ' s ruined me in those circles .
i must be healthy , then , because i ' m scared to death . i guess i ' d better get back to <person> .
you don ' t have to do that .
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know ?
maybe a little of both .
it isn ' t ? why do you think he lost his shit in there , huh ? ! what do you want , lady ?
i want my father .
no , i wouldn ' t think of --
because i have plans , i have lots of offers . i ' ve been offered a job by -- well , actually by --

the richest one percent of this country owns half the country ' s wealth : <number> trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do -- stock and real estate speculation . it ' s bullshit . <person> percent of the american people have little or no net worth . i create nothing ; i own . we make the rules , <person>dy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it . . you ' re not naive enough to think we ' re living in a democracy are you , <person>dy ? it ' s the free market . you ' re one of us now . take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . i got things to teach you .

hey , <person> . what do you think , leave the tent or maybe take it with us ?
anything against zippers ?
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . <person> rude . they seem to think we are quaint .
there ' s probably not too much you aren ' t great at .
are you about to compliment , my phone voice ?
i ' ve saved you and your friend from these bandits .
these ' bandits ' are the queen ' s own bodyguards .
<person> ' t tell me . another vision of incomparable beauty ?
beauty ? no . we ' re talking goddess .
i ' m not going anywhere , ted . you ' re the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
i decided to let <person> run the magazine . i need to go to college , learn a few things , you know . <continued_utterance> and i thought maybe i ' d take up boating . i ' ve always wanted to be a `` coxswain . ``
it was hungarian . most of them were hungarians . any fluent hungarians on your staff ?

my god . the lightness .

i can ' t just pick up replacements from radioshack ! i made most of that equipment myself !
then i ' m sure you can do it again .
<person> was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u . s . government . so , no , i don ' t have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government , fighting people like you , trying to keep this system a little bit honest .
last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country .
maybe , the professor could help you with that .
by reading my thoughts ?
i hear nothing . not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart . i think that ' s the way it goes .
did you and <person> get engaged ?
and she was wrong every time .
yes ! who was she ?
you ' re labelled .
oh . yeah . <continued_utterance> how did you know how to fire that , gun ? i ' ve never seen anything like it .
yes , but --
good .
<person> . what .
<person> . <person> ' t get all melancholy over the thirty seconds you were single a long time ago .
it ' s like jelly .
there ' s some kind of cellular breakdown . it ' s completely edematous . <continued_utterance> and there ' s been no autopsy performed . there ' s no y incision here ; no internal exam .
put the gun down , nice and .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen , you ' ve been a real pleasure .
i want to hear what happened . my brother is a jackass and a damn fool . the both of you have been as scarce as hen ' s teeth .
<person> , take <person> in the backyard . take a bowl so you can pick some strawberries . <person> will enjoy it . <continued_utterance> you shouldn ' t talk about the boy ' s father in front of him . this is family business and we have to pull together .
in case of what ?
in case there ' s some escaped psycho killer on the loose , who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us .
<person> ! at six miles an hour i ' m bolting into the street ! you schmuck ! you schmuck !
back away from me , do ya hear me ?
i think that ' s a good idea . <continued_utterance> i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park .
are you speaking to me in a code ?
as long as he keeps his throat clear , he is able to get some rest .
i made a fresh pot of coffee . <person> and i thought you need a rest . i ' ll stand guard . <person> wants to talk to you anyway .
i ' ve heard that one before .
i ' m serious .
i was eloquent . <person> . it ' s just inevitable , isn ' t it ? people are going to want to turn her into joan of arc --
-- and you into attila the hun .
<person> lousy bucks .
a man who plans ahead .
<person> don ' t mind . he likes i read his mail . saves him the time . plus a lot of folks around here can ' t read , so it ' s more a public service , really .
astonishing . thank you , lionel .
maybe it was just a dream . ya know , just one of them , what do ya call ' em , fitful dreams ?
yeah . fitful dreams .
<person> , i didn ' t know that .
i ' m thinking with your game you should go back to the qualifying school , try to get out on tour .
then what are you doing here ?
you were instructed to take <person> alive . do i have to remind you of the coroner ' s file-
i ' ll think of something , estelle . <continued_utterance> now the kid better not be here when the detectives start coming around . i ' d send him away for a while . a long while .
he can go make his father ' s life miserable !
i told him we didn ' t steal it , wil- low .
you haven ' t paid your debts . where did you get these seeds ?
will you please cut it out for a second , huh ? i didn ' t have any coffee either , it took me forever at the goddamn <person> .
<person> , well , here -- take the kid , i ' ve got work to do .

oh yeah , i see .
but you said i could !
i know , but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first .
we disappear for awhile . we disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .
but we all got to be in for this . we all go , or we do nothing .
and , of course , the u . n . must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast . <continued_utterance> and the second condition ?
time is of the essence .
it ' s for <person> . our dead homie .
you checked out , right ?
just because you got ' em to laugh ?
a laugh can be a powerful thing , <person> . sometimes it ' s the only weapon we have in life .
i ' ve got <person> if you need it .
i don ' t need <person> .
i ' m sorry , <person> .
you peeked , didn ' t you ?
your honeymoon ? <continued_utterance> should we ask the waiter to set another place ?
she ' s in pennsylvania .
you want anything special for dinner ?
no , thelma , i don ' t give a shit what we have for dinner . i may not even make it home for dinner . you know how fridays are .
prabably . i ' m going to the library in a few minutes . i just have to get out of this house ! hey ! why don ' t <person> and i come over there ? he ' ll come along if i tell him to .
that isn ' t what i had in mind .
look <person> , i ' m not a salesman . how many times i got ta tell you i ' m an account executive , and pretty soon i ' m going to the investment banking side of the firm .
you get on the phone and ask strangers for their money , right ?
so where is it then ?
somebody took it from him . that ' s what this whole thing ' s about .
what do you mean ?
i jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked . now it ' s totally fucked ! this is a disaster !
<person> funny how ?
well , like mama told me , <person> , <person> mama ? she found cockroaches in <person> underwear .
well , for heaven ' s sake !
you ' ve been very nice not canceling , we ' d like to make a gesture . until it snows , and you have guests , we ' ll take half salary .
i tried to save her . but she remained a manic depressive : fits , inappropriate behavior . delusions of grandeur .
i wonder if it runs in the family .
when will you be going ?
not long . a few days . <continued_utterance> you like it . <person> ' t you ?
i ' m aware of that .
so what ' s it doing in tijuana ? <continued_utterance> let me ask you a hypothetical question : if <person> worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel , and he went out of power , would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ?
no . in the brains . what little im sure he has .
you want me to shoot <person> in the brains with a gun .
but , last night .
who cares what- . i said last night , <person> i i was drunk , i was stoned . i ' d been bitten by a dog . my wife had left me . how ' bout cutting me some slack ?

lead man .

i know , dad . <person> getting a good education . and being able to respect your parents .
i ' ve got two words for you . <person> sex .
nothing we can do about that .
yes , there is . i ' d like to go up .

why don ' t you pick some of those rings out ya head maybe you won ' t be so stupid , ya dumb little shit .
open the windows .
that ' s not gon na help .
well -- i mean , have you ever considered that maybe that ' s part of what ' s making things so difficult for you ?
no .
just the home shopping <person> .
<person> any porcelain dolls ?
it ' s a waste . an awful waste .
what ' s the acreage here ?
<person> , gobble , gobble .
<person> ' t ever leave , <person> , ever . i ' ll never leave you .
why did you come here , <person> ?
i -just wanted to see her , i guess -- <person> . and to see you too-you and irene . and to let everyone know that , even though it may be difficult to comprehend now , this-everything that ' s happening-it ' s not forever . it doesn ' t mean `` goodbye . ``

all implanted .
yes , it is good . what do you think is in these other drawers ?
i don ' t know , <person> .
really ? i ' ve been thinking about it ever since i ate that fruit . <person> ' t you ever wonder what ' s on the other side of the mountains ?
there ' s nothing on the other side of the mountains . everybody knows that . the world just ends . you ' d fall right off the edge .
you must do this . you must finish what you ' ve started .
why ?
kelly .
she ' s going to wash your jeep ?
i can ' t .
let me see it .
we ' ll be drinkin ' margaritas by the sea , mamasita .
we can change our names .
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
we could work together . then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . there ' s a beach in bora bora with my name on it .
hey , <person> , you too . and be good .
i hate to be good .
<person> . is this true ?
i ' m seriously thinking about turning <person> . testifying against you . <continued_utterance> here we go . <continued_utterance> <person> do this a dozen times and every time the same thought : <continued_utterance> god help me if he ever hits me like that .
on his way to miami .
oh , yeah . he ' s got a lot of nerve ! leaving us with the kid again .
it ' s the same . what happened to what they gave you ?
i ' m desperate , but i ' m not stupid .
moving along - a typical plastic security card . name here , magnetic information stripe here - and a code breaking microprocessor here . swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you ' re in .
does it work on cash machines ?
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital .
one hour .
are you peeking ?
oh , quit your whining and pay up . <continued_utterance> no , no , not the ear . gim me the nose . c ' mon !
you can tie whoever did it to <person> .
forget it .
you ' re going to love this war , russell . there ' s good guys , bad guys , cheap shrimp . and <person> is still singing in the background . i missed you .
we got ta get alone somewhere to talk .
<person> , this smells terrible .
that ' s the life spark . exxence of magic and sorcery !
where is your granddaughter ?
the war has taken everything from everyone . he is all that i have left of her .
mrs . simmonds .
yes .
what ' s that ?
a padlock .
maybe we should start again , yes ? i know so little about you , except that you ' re not what you say you are .
that makes two of us then , sweetheart , because i ain ' t buying your bullshit either . you ' re not like them , i can see it in your eyes . so you tell me , who ' s bullshitting who ?
it ' s really a stupid opinion . you have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak .
because my opinion threatens yours , it ' s poorly developed ?
yeah ?
i love you .
i don ' t want it .
well , you ' re purely out of luck , aren ' t you , ' cause that rifle ' s on its way to seattle .
nope .
how ?
what ? ! you ' re calling <continued_utterance> you ' re a sick man , you know that ?
yeah well fuck you ! you just can ' t stand the fact that it was my turn .
plastique explosive shoelaces . cut them to regulate the size of the blast ; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe .
<person> way to tie up a . ' <person> ' problem ?
let her go .
no ! the gods demand a sacrifice ! and you ruined it !
conlon . <person> ' s conlon . and anything you want to know about <person> , you got ta ask him yourself .
i ' m just looking for some general information here .
what ' s the downside ?
the commies take over the world . <continued_utterance> excuse me , gentlemen , but the war may be over .
put a tap on her phone .
what ' re you talking about ? we have that .
<person> . got a private jet over at butler aviation . <person> , you always got ta light up when you see me , it ' s the .
<person> ' t start , alright .
think this may work , <person> .
<person> , take the crutch . <continued_utterance> now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward . <continued_utterance> good ! now with the muscles in your left shoulder , pull your right leg .
what ' s that , canuck ?
if we ' re not on the boat , how come the ground is moving ?
what would you call them then ?
i don ' t know . . ' episodes . ' <person> shrugs , spears a fluffy chunk of pie .
old . what are you writing ?
just notes . about work-
with milk !
do you want to be dead ?
you got me , peanut .
you certain ?
aw , <person> . i ' ve wrecked everything else , at least let me take care of you here .
russell . it ' s more dangerous being with you than being alone .
want a lesson ? <continued_utterance> press your left foot on the clutch . and turn the key . <continued_utterance> now release the brake . and slide the stick into first gear .
got it .
<person> . i ' m sorry if things didn ' t work out so well for you tonight . with <person> .
forget it . i should ' ve known better . your friend is just , i don ' t know , into collecting weird tricks . <person> ? <person> angles the rearview mirror toward himself .
childs ! !
let go of me .
you have a lot of talk in you , whole lot of talk .
damn it , jake . there is a guy coming to kill me , and if it comes down to me or <person> , then i pick <person> . you were going to give me thirteen-thousand . give me two-hundred . i ' ll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it . she showed me the perfect place . there won ' t be enough left for an autopsy . but i need the the money . i ' ve got to have the money .
she ' s seeing a guy . i don ' t know how serious it is , but the guy ' s a real horse ' s ass , in my opinion .
if you shared your heart with this woman -- maybe asked her out to dinner -- then it would force these issues out in the open .
sheeni , i have shown restraint , i have committed crimes , i have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you won ' t give me this one little thing .
<person> , <person> . why don ' t you just say it ? that ' s what you want . you want me to have sex with you .
you sure have weird friends .
you have no idea how weird .
when ?
the usual , <number> : <number> .
yeah . <person> ' s disappearance is definitely an inside job . that whole family feels hinky . the daughter was all bruises and no tears and <person> ' s hop-head wife looks part punching bag .
do you suspect either of the women ?
what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party . ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge .
well , well , when can we meet again .
<person> , get him down from there . he ' s gon na break his neck .
took you right to <person> , it did .
i can ' t quite picture you in the back woods of georgia .
where do you picture me , <person> ?
what ?
it ' s a water hazard . you go up there and take a drop . <person> to save par like you did yesterday .
he thought you were a woman , <person> !
madmartigan ! what did you do this time ?
i ' m puzzled as to why the bradley would assign you to the magdalena case when you ' re neither homicide nor <person> .
there ' s no body , and nothing was taken except <person> .
. ting the ruby slippers ?
the slippers -- yes . the slippers ! <continued_utterance> they ' re gone ! <continued_utterance> the ruby slippers ! what have you done with them ? give them back to me , or i ' ll -
if i ' m as bad as you think , what ' s stopping me from just killing you right now ?
this cup of turpentine right here . go for that gun in your purse and i ' m gon na let you have it .
no and i don ' t plan on sticking around either .
well , don ' t say i didn ' t warn you when things go your way .
and you chased one ?
something came over me , i just had nail him , no matter what the risk . it was pretty hairy . i thought he had me , a couple of times . but i really can ' t take credit . . .
it wouldn ' t have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you ' re a man without scruples .
wait a second --
are you taking penicillin ?
it can ' t be treated ! it ' s much worse than whatever you thought it was . there ' s a glitch in my swing .
i ' m not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body .
i am not common keith . i am not common . i am a creature like no other and i will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ? is that to much to ask ! ? !
a beauty , isn ' t it ? we bought three of them for the rec room .
we sell ' em to you for three bucks a piece !
<person> ' t you --
i don ' t have a weapon . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t go bitch on me now ! you were going to kill me . kill them !
nonsense -- let them wait . we are a stunning couple , eh ? my stomach is very flat -- i ' ve been working out .
we are a stunning couple . mr . president , you own one fifth of all the land in nicaragua , you own the shipping port , the national airlines , the mercedes dealership .
gin and ginger ale . elephants love booze . one whiff of this and she ' s not thinking about cabbages no more . . moj malutki paczuszek ?
greg , right ? are you polish ?
maybe you ' re not so good after all .
i ' ll kill you !
yeah , <person> , it ' s death therapy . it ' s a guaranteed cure .
<person> therapy . i like it .
wow . so that ' s the problem ! and i thought he was upset about me !
well he ' s always uptight , even when it doesn ' t show .
judge <person> , it ' s an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she ' s a minor ; it probably would ' ve expunged on her <number> th birthday anyway .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .
i got him ! you see that , i nailed him !
damn it ! <continued_utterance> wes , take the wheel . <continued_utterance> take it ! <continued_utterance> keep it steady . <continued_utterance> damn it ! i said keep it steady .
how am i supposed to talk to you ?
like i was ! talk to me like i was !
<person> .
you get mugged ?
so where do we start ?
wherever you want .
i ' m up to speed , <person> .
<person> <person> wouldn ' t tell me what the blue rose meant .
why ?
cuz i want new york .
the stripper ' s here .
excellent .
you care which bed ?
i ' d prefer facing southeast .
have we met ?
this afternoon . our boats practically kissed in the harbor . <person> .
did you understand what was expected of you ?
yes , but . how do you expect .
you ' re kidding ! that son-of-a- bitch !
<person> ' t worry , i told him everything he had to know , and i made her four bott .
<person> ?
yeah . and throw it into <person> .
<person> ' t <person> lynched ?
you know as well as i do that it was made to look like he was lynched . now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree ?
did you hear me , <person> ? <person> closed .
i ' m sure the d .
that country shit all sounds the same to me .
how about i pick one out for you ? <continued_utterance> you like <person> ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she don ' t put out no more new records .
what ' s the point ? there ' s nothing here . the map ' s a fake . <person> , even i see that now . we ' re just wasting our time . we might as well give up and --
you listen to me . the whole reason we ' re here is because of you and that map of yours . i didn ' t do all this for nothing , and i ' m not leaving with nothing . if you think for a second i ' m giving up just ' cause you ' re too tired to turn over some dirt , then you don ' t know <person> too well , do you ? so you dig , and you keep on digging ' til i say you don ' t have to dig anymore .
then why can ' t we see it ?
because we ' re in this room on december <number> st , <number> , while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away . this room , or even this house , may no longer exist a hundred years from now . but the time machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey . <continued_utterance> you must remember that the space you ' ve just put your hand through is today ' s space . you can ' t put your hand into the space of tomorrow . dr . hillyer space is space ! it doesn ' t change ! the same space that is here now should be here a hundred or even a thousand years from now . <continued_utterance> no ! time changes space . this flat ground we ' re standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago . and a million years from now it could be the interior of a huge mountain .
your father worked in a mannequin factory ?
<person> . that ' s where he met my morn . she was a fry cook in the cafeteria . before that , she ' d been a dancer .
what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat .
<person> ' s where it ' s at , <person> . gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of . you ought to try it some time .
<person> .

<person> : why , you dirty , old -

he ' s escaped from the insane asylum . in <number> , he murdered two children . broke into a house and found them asleep in bed . it was a little boy , five an a half , and a little three- year-old girl . after the coroner ' s investigation , their bodies were taken to the mortuary , where the undertaker took one look at them and said he couldn ' t have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral without six days of steady work . then he asked what had been the murder weapon , because looking at the mess in front of him , he couldn ' t imagine what had been used . the coroner told him there had been no murder weapon . the killer had used only his hands . the undertaker went to work and had them done in four . <continued_utterance> what ' s the matter ?
he ' s been here .
a tad ?
can ' t condone it myself . but it is a short haul . hour there , hour back .
daikinis are giant people who live far far away .
are you scared ? <continued_utterance> i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !
i wanted to thank you , <person> , for saving my flock .
oh , hey - it was nothing .

i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about . this is just a whole ' nother ball game !
where ' s the motorcycle ?
<person> ' t you want to know how i did that ?
august .
it ' s good to have an educated man like you around . i need one other sane individual in this operation .
<person> , <person> . somebody die and leave you a broom ?
go to hell , <person> !
the thing i like about you , <person> , is you ' re not only kind and generous , you ' re handsome .
we ' re going to have to sit up all night . <person> ' s get some shut eye .
yes . and the old guys we chased-
no .
absolutely .
a train was trapped underground with him inside .
so you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business .
that ' s right , boss .
<person> .
not true .
how ' bout the pipe ? jake she ' s got a slender neck .

that ' s good .
yes , it is good . what do you think is in these other drawers ?
your nickname is <person> ?
it ' s a long story , and we don ' t know each other .
what do we do ? graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing ?
uh-uh . that could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip . <person> him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here . <continued_utterance> why don ' t we just wipe out the memory of his visit here ? mcclane yes . <person> . i ' ll destroy his file and cancel his fee . i have a feeling that the longer he doesn ' t know who he is , where he ' s been , where he ' s going and who we are , the better off we ' ll all be . i ' m taking a holiday . a real one .
i believe you would .
why did you say that ?
i don ' t have time for this . <continued_utterance> take your hand off me , brody .

they call me mr . <person> at school . cause i break like glass . <person> ' s face is tense . unyielding . <person> .
i do not want to know the story behind this photo . who ' s <person> ?
it ' s a nickname .
what are we going to do with it ?
give it back to her mother , that ' s what .
so you pay off our customs officials ?
in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity , this is not so true for the usa . using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search . the odds are not high , and we found variables that reduce the odds . we hire drivers with nothing to lose . then we throw a lot of product at the problem . some get stopped . enough get through . it ' s not difficult .
this is <person> . ?
yes . price .
thanks , <person> .
and get rid of the dog .
they have every right <person> .
they send us because they want us to change , or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same .
breaking and entering , theft , and willful destruction of private property . and i ' ll add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge i ' m about to file against you .

<person> , that ' s a misdemeanor . you go down there to arrest ' em , something goes wrong , maybe this time somebody gets his head <person> , suddenly it ' s a mess and it won ' t end there , you ' ll have <person> comin ' around lookin ' for trouble from here to <person> . you gon na risk all that over a misdemeanor ?
no , damn it , it ' s wrong , they ' re <person> ' the law .
what did you do to those people ?
nothing .

iandiacute ; m going to change the world with or without you as a witness , <person> . and this one gets a front row seat .
do you want to sit down ?
thanks . this is a very nice house .

when did this fucking package fucking arrive , <person> ?
i don ' t know why they call it a `` home '' . you don ' t know anybody there . they fill you so full of drugs , you don ' t care . five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died . they take turns visiting me on weekends . they forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up . <continued_utterance> i had a life , ya know . a big life . it isn ' t right .

i wasn ' t disbarred , they dropped the pro .
and it seems to me , a fella ' s trying to come back , he ' d take this settlement , and get a record for himself . i myself would take it and run like a thief .

that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life , she ' s in a coma , her life is gone . she has no family , she has no home , she ' s tied to a machine , she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her : her doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . we have been paid to look the other way . i came in here to take your money . i brought snapshots to show you . so i could get your money . i can ' t take it . if i take it . if i take that money i ' m lost . i ' m just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . i can ' t do it . i can ' t take it .

<person> ' t make me raise my hand to you . you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction .
<person> ' t i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? the world is not black and white . show me one perfect person .
cuz you ' re a cop .
not no more .
nine thousand dollars .
what is he planning on telling them ?
so they say , but the only one who ever goes in is the high priest . they say it ' s instant death for anyone else to enter .
then why am i going in ?
i may have seen her on campus .
not personally .
mr . <person> , i ' ve got to tell you , that ' s the most wonderful thing i ever saw . what was that ?
<person> ' s all right but he ' s no match for the melancholy dane . <person> , dear friend , the supreme role of any actor worth his salt .
oh yeah , that ' d make golf real fun -- the guy doesn ' t even drink beer or gamble . now <person> smiles . mary get over here .
really ?
what about you ?
my life is over . go . <continued_utterance> go now !
the same interest as yours <person> . <person> . i thought it ' d be a good investment for my kid .
no . this time i ' m in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , <person> . i ' m going to turn it around . you ' re getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you ' re costing me to buy back the stock , i could modernize the plant . i ' m not the only one who pays here <person> . we ' re talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers .
there is only one solution to your problem , mrs . <person> . you must work for us .
oh shit . <person> . what ' re you doing ?
how ' d you get in this line of work ?
after i got out of the army i sat down and figured it out ! who never got in trouble in the army ? the m . p . ' s ! they were the ones who arrested you ! so i came back here and ran for sheriff !
bad news , kid , it was baby laxative .

reroute it , like all the others .
right . can i get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble ? sitwell glares at him . <continued_utterance> it ' d be a nice gesture . <continued_utterance> hold a sec . we got something outside the fence , west side .

i ' m wally . i ' m a friend of your mom ' s . <continued_utterance> so , uhm , uh . your mom says you need a ride . did i mention i ' m a friend ?
<person> .
now , as for the nipples , you ' ve got to be very , very , very careful . <continued_utterance> as soon as the hole gets too big she ' s got ta throw them out -- this is extra , extra , extra-specially important -- ' cause if the hole ' s too big , the milk comes out too fast and it ' s bad for her digest .
well then , i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town . you ' re the one brought it up . this morning . in your car .
oh , that was just loose talk . husband gettin ' pissed off . i don ' t want anybody dead .
the government accused me of using the church to hide <person> and guns .
governments are always wrong , eh ?
what ?
so <person> , when were you going to tell me about the <number> million dollars we got in from san francisco two days after i got arrested ?
can i bring some toys ?
you can bring one toy .
ninety-two . course half hour from now might be seventy-two . these clouds move around a lot . <continued_utterance> what happened to your hand ?
accident .
oh , please don ' t make fun of me , mr , <person> . you don ' t know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do .
<person> , well , you don ' t know how hard it is bein ' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do .
<person> ' s gon na be looking for a take down .
definitely gon na be looking for a take down . <continued_utterance> <person> is down ! <person> has been knocked out ! <person> is most definitely for real !
i don ' t want to have any conversation .
<person> , cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person .
dont fuck with me , man . you look like a clown in that stupid jacket .
this is a snakeskin jacket , and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom .
you ' ve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers .
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .
i ' m just so scared of that song . that fucking , `` my son just arrived the other day . he says thanks for the ball , come on let ' s play . i got lots of bills come again next day . he ' s grown up just like me . my boy is just like me . `` <person> fucking <person> , <person> , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .
<person> . `` cats in the cradle . ``
is it really that obvious ?
it ' s not a good look for you . <person> , your heart is not the only organ you wear on your sleeve . there ' s a certain , vulgar appeal to your transparency .
a father is nothing but sperm , ted .
it ' s all so complicated .
i don ' t see <person> winning . fuck it , i ' m not gon na even place the bet . i just made a hundred bucks .
what are you , crazy ? what happens if he wins ?

you decided to go with the network .
is he a good fuck ?
i have to be honest with you , ted . i really despise `` the girls of xenia . ``
i know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
i ' m guessing that ' s what the soprano shriek was about , pumpkin .
i ' m going to get some bactine .
of course not ! what , are you crazy ? i ' m relieved ! <person> she ' s out of here !
i made her four bott .
we ' re in deep shit over here . <person> ' s change that plan .

do you know where i can definitely find parking ?
there ' s nothing close by . even the valet ' s backed up . you might want to try further out . <continued_utterance> but be willing to walk .
tell me , q-ster . you do ever do any gardening ?
. the only thing i ever planted was bugs .
shit . he ' s just some old vet i train with . he means nothing to me . from what i hear he means nothing to you , either , so you got balls talking about forgiveness .
that ' s got nothing to do with forgiveness . i ' ve got a family to protect . everything i do is for them . <continued_utterance> but i forgave <person> . just like i forgave you and <person> .
what happened to this circus ?
went belly up . pretty common nowadays . circus bosses see the end coming and they ' d pull a runner with all the money . <person> belongs to the town now . august can get anything he wants for a song . <continued_utterance> most of them will never belong to another show . and they know it .
are you over at dr . <person> ' ?
<person> , i ' ve been here for about an hour already .
<person> , what ? <person> , what is it ?
i ' m going on national television tomorrow -- to promote a fraud !
would you like a little clam-dip , honey ?
no , thanks . love a little bundt cake if you have some !
i thought of that . then i said , come on , you ' re <person> . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you don ' t want to sit in jail for three months . unless .
unless what ?
where ?
jake hides it . in a safe . in the floor . in the bedroom . he counts it . he loves to sit there and count it .
would have been a perfect time .
right . <person> was missing . . and sanchez .
i ' m in church .
what does that got to do with it ?
boy , oh boy ! did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today ?
yes , i did . i came in last night , she was sleeping on my side of the bed . in my life i never got out of bed on the left side . in my life , never from the left . i got close once up in the catskills . i met this girl , dorian . for a week we were together , but it wasn ' t the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff . she didn ' t have things in my room . <continued_utterance> all this ' cos i ' m trying to get even with some guy . you know what ? i think i got to see her and put an end to this .
absolutely , sir . he thinks he ' s <person> , a computer .
then how do you explain what he ' s doing ?
soon she ' ll be everywhere .
all this , because you fell for <person> ?
what ?
that wasn ' t him . i heard him tell the cops .
oh , i suppose you could never be with a woman who gets manicures .
forget it . it ' s okay . i forgive you .
i ' m happy to help . but my price is $ <number> , <number> . not <number> .
$ <number> , <number> should buy more than help .
just remember , i ' ll be watching .
i ' ve got something for you to chew on . next time you send someone to save the world , make sure they like the planet the way it is .
i ' m on vacation ! !
are you sure ? maybe you should check in here for a few days and get a handle on things ?
you are going right back to bed .
but i haven ' t brushed my teeth yet .
what did i do ?
you don ' t know what you ' re talking about ! there was nothing else i could do ! i can ' t explain it better than that , but you can ' t go on like this because you don ' t know anything about it and you don ' t know what you ' re doing !
you didn ' t say what it was for , did you ?
no , honey . i told him i was buyin ' a car . what is it for ?
but you know that it is a war , old friend . and to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs , by any means necessary . and for that reason , i will always have the advantage . no matter how you trap me , how i am contained - chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation
and i will always be there , old friend .
you mind telling me why you ' re looking for him first ?
he ' s my grandfather . i came to live with him .
maybe they just took it out of his pocket .
then why ' d they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler <number> from <person> and it won ' t open .
the idea ' s never occurred to me , sir .
well , think about it . well ?
my battery ' s going . i ' m a block away . see you in five minutes .
okay but i won ' t be able to wait very . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
you were expecting me , weren ' t you ?
it ' s non-refundable .
but the guards .
do as i say . <continued_utterance> stand back .
but which i can get . no problem . <person> , i can sell my car in vegas . <person> book it ' s worth <number> at least . i just need the <number> , uh . <person> looks like he ' s ready to pound heads . mr . arkady where are you ? bobby uh . a little shithole in arizona called superior . about <number> miles east of phoenix . mr . arkady superior , hunh ? <person> suddenly feeling suspicious . <continued_utterance> yeah , if you could send it care of .
. now , let me get this straight . two years you give me problems with your fuckin ' payoffs . now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
there i slap that mutha fucka face - pay attention fucka - otherwise we hafta work it all night . <person> much fun for us - you see what i mean ? now watch me how i touch a bottle and you count how many times .
you see , <person> . i toucha number one bottle once , i toucha number two bottle once , and i touch your face . this is a game we love to play . i get hot already . now you meet second mr . <person> . does he fish or dont he ?
thank you .
and these roses . they ' re much prettier up close .
nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful .
in conclusion : both these men have a vendetta against the world . they are nuclear armed , and dangerous . and having failed to get the uz <number> through the old opium route - the khyber pass - it ' s nato ' s belief that their next attempt will be through bulgaria - where the nato nuclear strike force will be there to stop them .
what do we do with the humvee ?
we leave it .
i won ' t .
and lighten up will ya .
. you know , that ' s another reason you ' re probably not in a successful relationship .
another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?
i ' d kiss your mother with this mouth . i mean , if she wasn ' t , you know .
so far away ? in xenia ?
wes is right . if there were any more mines we would have found them . <person> , that one you stepped on was probably old anyway ; left over from the war with iran .
you don ' t know that . it could be a trick .
<person> , its a real problem for me , sailor , you know ? when i went in that drugstore by the restaurant in biloxi ? i saw em by the register and the girl throw em in . im not big on resistin . so what about a leech ?
<person> on the radio how doctors is usin leeches again , just in old times . you know , when even barbers used em ?
. i know . cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs .
they ' re going to be pressing for a military solution soon . we can ' t afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats . we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here .
he ' s up at the <person> out .
will he be back soon ?
that ' s it ? nothing else about me ?
oh yes . <person> to you and <person> . who ' s <person> ?
what ' s that supposed to mean ?

i was forced to trust you and you panicked and you neural-surged , and you blew my pod .

i ' m pissin ' fire man .

you don ' t think i can do it .
yes . from the highest authority . there are two conditions . the u . n . must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles .

<person> .
i don ' t like looking at my own .

you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , <person> .
letandiacute ; s just say that i am out to make some radical changes . now come on <person> . for old times sake , for your sake . leave him to me .
i ' m not interested . i ' ve already got a job .
you ' re an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you ' re not getting any younger .
what a gasser .
<person> here .
got it . we owe you one , sheriff .
my man <person> here put it together . <person> officer , chief . he spoke to the doctor at the hospital .
i never said that .
yes you did . last night . to your friend

<person> , <person> . <person>mond <person> , criminal division .
-- a life most suckers can ' t dream of '' !
ha , you too , huh ?
look at these balls . <person> new titleists . <person> ' em , every one a brand new titleist . sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance . we swipe enough free shit we might even pay for this fiasco .
you think it would be inappropriate to ask <person> for an autograph ?
what are you --
watch out !
it means you shouldn ' t be taking care of another kid . especially a convict .
<person> , well .
are you all right ?
i ' m okay .
yes , sir .
a mistake ?
sure . you know how to hotwire a car ?
no .
<person> ?
and he ' s the real thing . specializes in cases like this , like yours .
he has a lot of hurt inside him .
well , he better learn to own it . actions have consequences . it ' s not what happens here alice , it ' s what they take away with them .
this is the abou-deian revolutionary front .
you ' re shitting me . <continued_utterance> these guys be pissed if they knew , eh ? this is the dumbest motherfucker i ever signed up for . <person> ' t pay shit either . <person> . that ' s the spot . <person> shrimp , lotta rays -- real thin in the spook department too , dig ?
<person> ' s do this . <continued_utterance> where ' s he headed ?
he owns a big industrial complex on the river . he ' ll launch it from there . xander floors it .
<person> pages ?
let your fingers do the walking .
it ' s been a long time . i tried to see you but your people wouldn ' t let me .
i didn ' t want to see me , okay . but then i woke up today and finally , a good hair day .
but i love you , <person> .
and i love you , too . but don ' t wear my stuff .
is he a fraud ?
how would you ever know ?
you must have plans for new year ' s eve . <person> ' t let me keep you .
mary isn ' t well . we decided to stay home with the baby . but why don ' t you come home with me . you haven ' t seen little jaime for a long time .
what do you mean , <person> my own place ?
i mean i --
yeah . they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
that ' ll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i ' ll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?
two . there ' s a guy in county hospital , but he ' s in a coma . the d . a . has the other guy - a cripple - from new york i think . <person> , the chief said -
<person> me .
<person> . i will .
you don ' t have to go if you don ' t want to , honey .
thank you .
you ' re really . you , are you the one they told me was the nurse ?
i ' m in the home stretch . i ' ll be done in approximately six more years .
should i discount ?
not important .
oh , <person> wants a progress report on the movie broad -- bledsoe- -hang up . <person> to my car .
well , you ' re here . and we ' re here . together . we ' ll think of something .
get me out of here .
<person> . buy it .
<person> -- right . <continued_utterance> dr . <person> , you ' re gon na love this !
sweated up like a stuck pig . and be careful . he was fucking around with his front door before he left . i don ' t know what he was doing .
two honks if he shows . then meet me in the alley , back of his place .
i ' ll go see her at leo ' s before practice . but i want to go alone .
<person> , that ' s ok but <person> but you have to promise me .
the lord will provide the sheep .
uh -- is this like a magic trick ?
what ?
that guy was hurtin ' me . and if you hadn ' t come out when you did , he ' d a hurt me a lot worse . and probably nothin ' woulda happened to him . ' <person> everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night . and they woulda made out like i asked for it . and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now . at least now i ' m havin ' fun . and i ' m not sorry the son of a bitch is dead . i ' m only sorry that it was you that did it and not me . and if i haven ' t , i wan na take this time to thank you , <person> . thank you for savin ' my ass .
why ' d you point at me that day ?
because you ' re an alien . you don ' t belong in concrete any more than i do . this place would like to kill us because we ' re different .
what about <person> ?
mr . <person> knew nothing . mr . <person> rarely t works with the same people for very long , and they never know who they ' re working for . one can not be betrayed if one has no people .
because i honestly thought he ' d go for me . i thought i was doing you a favor . apparently not appreciated .
<person> , big favor .
so what about the girls ? <person> ' s poor , but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ? surely her father . <continued_utterance> this one ' s got you working overtime , hasn ' t it ?
i flat don ' t like the guy , <person> . he ' s dirty . and i ' ll tell you something else . you want to know how old man <person> lost his money ? he was fucked out of it by old man <person> , on a little item known as the salt creek land deal . it was after the war . <person> set up a corporation to develop swamp land , got investors like <person> to put up money , then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve , on the sly , of course , but everyone knew it was him . the freeway went to the coast , right where <person> wanted it .
yes , mr . <person> ?
if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way .
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away .
what do you mean ?
we ' ve got no cboice . <person> way , we ' ve got no choice .
well ?
what does that got to do with it ?
<person> , you still have <person> ' s number ?
have you examined them ?
no . just fossils , far as i know .
i don ' t know . but i have a hunch what you ' re going to find here isn ' t anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .
<person> , this is going to take some time , and somebody ' s going to figure out soon enough we ' re not even supposed to be here . i ' m in serious violation of medical ethics .
why do you say that ?
i don ' t know . he was always -- he always had to be better than you at everything . you know . like if you were all playing basketball or something , everybody ' s havin ' like a friendly game and he ' s like ready to kill somebody if his team didn ' t win . or like if you told like a joke or a story , he always had to tell a better one ? kinda gets annoying after a while . plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you . he was a prick . probably still a prick . fortunately for you though , your mom is like , the greatest . so you had some bad luck and you had some good luck . you mind if i ask you a personal question ?
oh , thank god , you ' re still here ! there ' s been a terrible mistake . that wasn ' t the package you were s ' posed to take . it was another one . i have it right here .
what do you mean ? what other package ?
get out of here .
that ' s why she hates me . that ' s why she makes me sleep in the basement .
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --
damn . <person> na be another hot one today . sometimes i don ' t even want to get out of bed . course don ' t want to get out for the cold one ' s neither . then of course the clouds come in .
you think i ' m gon na let some schmuck know all my business . have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that . i need some privacy .
taxes is serious stuff , <person> .
we got to get our bags and be at the station in ten minutes ! we ' ll never make it !
just a moment ! <person> !
but she wrote the letters .
<person> night , <person> . i ' ll see you tomorrow . he walks away , leaving <person> .
did you mean what you said back there , <person> ? <person> starts to well up again . mary <person> . ?
i . i just want you to be happy , <person> .
what if we ' re wrong about him ?
then we ' re wrong .
i never let her scream for hours !
you ' d resort to any theory to not take care of her . just because you ' ve read some books .
maybe we should try and fix the radio . try and get some help .
maybe we shouldn ' t .
mostly compare and contrast stuff .
-chapter <number> : don ' t write shit down . chapter <number> : or other cops might kill you .
we can ' t do this .
we ' ve already done this .
<person> loose of him .
he just killed a man .
you ' re going to <person> , right ?
no . your dad specifically said <person> and <person> were evil .
yeah , <person> . everything ' s gon na be fine .
i guess you won ' t be coming home tonight .
<person> , i told you i ran into another tin man .
he didn ' t tell me he was a tin man . he told me he sold baby pictures .
let your fingers do the walking .
they ' re playing our song . dare i ask for this dance ?
<person> ' t tell me : heavy duty .
<person> , heavy duty . <person> . <person> . it ' s one of those few places we ' d never go to as kids . still don ' t . some of the old people say <person> is buried back there . we have to go <person> . together . like his vision .
hey to bluestar , as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad . <continued_utterance> you sure about this faa announcement ?
about what ?
iandiacute ; ll see what i can do -- you should get some sleep . even with your healing ability , youandiacute ; re going to be hurting for a while .
what if i like the pain ?
i haven ' t forgotten .
<person> , he ' s not looking inside . he ' s just striking out at the world .
cause i don ' t take <person> . i don ' t know what you ' re up to , lady , but i ' m gon na nail you for the acme murder .
if i ' m as bad as you think , what ' s stopping me from just killing you right now ?
i feel like i ' m never gon na see you again . !
of course you will , <person> . you never have to worry about that .
' start over . ' do you know how many times i ' ve started over , sweetheart ? i don ' t want to do it anymore . this is as far as i want to go . this place . i have to make this work somehow . we do . you ' re fourteen now -- you have to help me .
but if .
i knew it . i knew you were a musketeer the moment i saw you .
you did ?
what ?
i ' d go to australia . lot of land , not many people . i think after this i ' d like to quit people for awhile . and the girls go crazy for brothers down there .
what ' s stopping you ?
i just want to see the old century out by myself . filby have it your own way .
<person> . here i was , finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
four o ' clock . m will meet you in the conference room .
i hope so . i think maybe she sees me now . <continued_utterance> i ' m building a larger one to see the nucleus of <person> ' s comet --
the dirty snowball at its core .
i ' d call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she wasn ' t your mother mother --
give me those !
nah , yo got the yellow fever .
i ' m telling you , it ain ' t natural how she gets away every time .
thank you .
this all happened because of you , didn ' t it --
they will likely notify their parents . perhaps even expel them .
that ' s it ! expel them . then <person> will have to come back to ukiah .
well , you ' re wrong .
about some things , yeah . not about this . you ' re a goddam hog , and i proved it .
yup . there are a couple more falls in the park , but none quite so . inviting as this one . now don ' t take my word for it , you can see for yourself . how long ' s your stay ?
just til sunday .
then you should just say so !
i just did .
look out ! look out ! <continued_utterance> <person> !
we almost died .
<person> killed a guy .
what are you talking about ? <person> didn ' t kill anybody .
really ? <person> said that ?
<person> and he also said ' don ' t tell anyone about it -- anyone at all . '
what the hell is it ?
it looks like a cow .
oh , yeah . <person> to see you , kid .
thanks , <person> .
he is not cracking up .
<person> . what have we done ?
boston , huh ? did you get your degree up there ?
yes yes , i did get my degree up there .
we print <number> newspapers here ; another two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite plants around the world .
. and how many of those newspapers carried <person> ' s obituary ?
. like it never even happened .
<person> , okay , i ' m sure that i just . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
<person> or <person> ?
neither .
should i just get up and go there ?
yeah . i ' ll take care of your incoming boards . <continued_utterance> remember . the chinese restaurant for lunch .
i don ' t know , but i am . she was there and then she was gone . i felt it .
<person> .
not your traditional wedding ring , but it ' s all the same in the lord ' s eyes . how long have you two been wed ?
oh . we ' re not married . not yet anyway .
oh , well , here -- let me help you .
oh , that ' s very kind of you -- very kind .
where ?
in the head .
<person> . i got to be on the sidelines during the game . you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at-
characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
do you need some money ?
no , i don ' t need any money . thank you very much .
you ' re incapable of sincerity .
am i ? <continued_utterance> i ' ve looked forward to this day as long as you have . you ' re my brother and my friend . sometimes i ' m envious , but never doubt that i love you . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> .
my father ' s alive but it ' s like he ' s dead . <continued_utterance> what is that ?
that is my telescope .
the big boy did . ?
that <person> was working on . yeah . he thought <person> needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so <person> finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a ' spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him ' <person> , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he can ' t be comforted . he tells the boys at <person> and <person> they ' ve disappointed him , he ' s going to the judge to rat them out .
<person> ?
good night , <person> .
not to mention ketchup and hot peppers .
it ' s too bad you don ' t live down here , ted .
mr . <person> . it ' s too bad your client didn ' t show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney . <continued_utterance> lately the only variation i ' m hearing in your argument is the name of the client . and you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of illinois v . <person> , but you aren ' t going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants . furthermore , there is no sacred protection of property rights in the united sates . when you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm , whether it ' s one joint or an acre of plants , your property can be seized and your property can be sold .
i ' m sorry the court finds my argument repetitious .
<person> was a piece of shit .
you trying to get a rise out of me , <person> ?
we have to stick with the plan .
<person> ?
you gone buck wild , nigga ? we ain ' t going down for shit .
you ain ' t earned the right to call me a nigga . and that goes for all you haters .
get up !
they said i ' d never see fbi again , and i ' m livin ' with you fuckers . i don ' t feed ya information on the warriors , it ' s back to the pen . i don ' t do this , back to the pen . your word against my word . against a con indian ' s word . i really got a chance , man , right ?
just do it ! this is no time for small talk .
how did you know where to find me ?
we want to meet him .
he wants to meet you . he called last night and asked me to set it up . what do i tell him '
<person> ' t blame yourself . in your shoes , i don ' t think i would have told <person> , either . so do you think <person> has become the dominant personality ?
i ' m not sure . my guess is that ' s what <person> wants us to think .
what more than that ? <continued_utterance> the casket wasn ' t the only thing you took from jotunheim that day , was it ?
no . <continued_utterance> in the aftermath of the battle , i went into the temple , and i found a baby . small for a giant ' s offspring -- abandoned , suffering , left to die . <person> ' s son .
that ' s two people in one day who wanted to actually kill you .
i ' ve never been more popular .
i crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea .
<person> , i would think you would depend on prayer rather than these old fashion remedies . let us read from the bible .
<person> ? what the hell you doing back already ?
<person> , get out ! get up on your roof or someplace ! we found out what ' s been killing people ! they ' re under the ground !
what was her name ?
<person> . her name is <person> .
yeah .
well , he doesn ' t live here anymore .
this wasn ' t my idea .
i ' m sorry ?
i called him . i told him to pick up <person> and get over here . everyone turns their attention to ted . ted <person> , i found out that your buddy <person> there lied to you about <person> . <person> lowers his head . ted <person> never said anything bad about <person> . he loves <person> . and from what he just told me on the phone , he loves you , too . he ' s the guy you should be with .
that ' s right , <person> . and you know i ' ll always be true to you .
let us settle this tomorrow .
<person> ! <person> ' t try to get ahead by riding our backs .
in my day , they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow . <person> kid didn ' t even know what the spec was .
you sound like you know circuses .
<person> , i need for you to be practical and realistic .
<person> ? i am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition . i am trying to be practical . now either you ' re with me or against me . in or out !
for first-timers , i recommend either <person> or <person> .
<person> ? as in `` the donner party ? ''
unconsciously , <person> , i don ' t have a clue what i ' m talking about .
i feel we ' re making progress .
just . want to be ready when we do .
<person> for what ? sight-seeing ?
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and <person> hadn ' t taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
but it ' s not the lives we saved . it ' s the lives we didn ' t .
i mean , did you ask her ? what kind of drugs has she tried ?
i . i don ' t really know .
<person> your tone , mister .
why don ' t you just admit what this is really all about ? i ' m not your real kid and you can ' t control me anymore . <continued_utterance> no wonder i was so bored . no wonder i hated this one-horse cow town . i come from talented people who took chances and dared to imagine a life without limits ! i was never meant to be raised by . grocers .
it ' s very hard for me to come and tell you this . <continued_utterance> it ' s <person> . he ' s going to do something stupid . i ' m worried that he ' ll get himself killed . <continued_utterance> he ' s saying he ' s going to talk to the americans . become an informer .
why does he need money ?
i look like an idiot .
you act like an idiot , you look fine .
no need to be jealous , <person> .
if i ' m to get <person> expelled and sent back to me i will need a partner in crime .
i always knew you ' d end up in a crow ' s cage .
least i ' m not down there herding sheep !
well , let me first say that i ' m kinda glad i lost this game . i don ' t usually play such nasty characters . <continued_utterance> and , <person> , you were so good in that role that i suspect it won ' t be long before pilgrimage is after you to sign a designing contract . and maybe you should take your friend <person> , here , mr . <person> , with you . he ' s obviously good in a crisis , and when you design games , there are plenty of them .
i guess you all could tell that <person> and i had a relationship prior to our coming here . we really do like to play together .
<person> ?
mr . crabtree was saying how <person> killed himself , only he couldn ' t remember how .
you may not believe this <person> but i really do care for you . i think we could ' ve made a good team . but that ' s how it goes .
get the hell out !
you know what that will mean for <person> .
i don ' t care . you heard that girl ' s statement . i think he ' s dirty . get me a case .
how far do you think you ' d get out there before running into mr .
i ' m not going to just sit here and watch you die !
you haven ' t answered the question .
well . i ' d like to think that love is a question of destiny , not chance .
also punishable by death .
it was a long day .
<person> ? must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays .
here you go .
what are you doing ?
calling taggarty to report that you are not completely incompetent in the bedroom .
huh ? oh . <person> or fury . with <person> and <person> .
she went crazy , <person> .
<person> , we don ' t have time for this -
sure ! just when i want to talk - not that i would have believed you -
what do you mean ?
the huguenot rebellion , occupation in the antilles and <person> . the coming war with france . these are not the usual hobbies of youth .
why would i do that ? why don ' t i just leave , period ?
well . if that ' s what you want to do , that ' s fine . but that ' s not what i ' m saying . you are a very important person to rudy , and you are the most important person to me . but i ' m saying that i can ' t take any more of this --
tell the class what a chiropractor does , <person> .
he helps people by fixing their backs , <person> .
i work for <person> .
what is this ?
we ' re going to get court martialed , you know that .
<person> , we ' ll just buy our way out .
thelma ! i ' m not gon na talk about this ! now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will ! you understand ?
no , <person> . how come you never said what happened ?
<person> was in the world by himself .
somebody has to take responsibility for him .
you don ' t need a car you can ' t drive for a month . go see <person> .
' bout what ?
do it !
<person> ! this isn ' t what you think .
what about the allies ? congress ? i think we may need to start letting key people know . and they ' re all scattered across the country for the campaign . we ' re going to need to get the u . n . staff in and warmed up . <person> . i don ' t even know if we ' ve got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours .
we can ' t worry about everything right now . we ' ve got to figure out what we ' re going to do before we worry about how we do it .
so that ' s a maybe ?
the answer is never , ted , never . <person> maybe in your dreams .
you can ' t have both . there ' s a law .
oh , we ' ll never meet them again , what does it matter ?
<person> ' t you get it ? ! you see the hat ? i am mrs . <person> ! !
snap out of it , <person> !
<person> ' s parents died in a car accident .
i know . they ' re my parents too .
i ' m sorry mr . <person> --
<person> .
she ' s going to have a baby .
does <person> know ? what have you done to us ?
back then i had intricate systems with women you wouldn ' t believe .
<person> . what .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you don ' t think at some point somebody might notice that she ' s gone ?
nobody knows she ' s here . i called her personally . nobody knows .
i ' m afraid to ask . what ' s the other theory ?
grip it and rip it .
nah . i ' m good . but keep these coming . <person> checks a ticket and prepares two drinks . <continued_utterance> so how you doing , pal ?
me ? i ' m pretty good .
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .
wearing them ? or humping them ?
he ' s dead - good and dead .
<person> to hear it .
what is it ?
god , you have great legs .
they ' re ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it ' s only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy <person> . then we ' re gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
<person> in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
no .
<person> , the town is packed but i guess if you know the right people . <person> , i know we can ' t work but let ' s get the friendship thing going . <continued_utterance> i ' m a little anxious about being here by myself but i don ' t want to barge in . i ' ll call . give my best to the fam and see ya around , okay ?
while i appreciate your poetic sensibility , mr . mcavoy --
call me roy , <person> .
what you do is take vengeance ! <person> is a sin against heaven !
that ' s your way , not mine .
where is it ? where ' d it go ?
<person> low .
that ' s right .
you ' re under arrest for violation of federal narcotics laws . <continued_utterance> we have a warrant to search your home , mrs . <person> .
wait a minute , i don ' t get it ! we take the basket and the milk , that ' s all . we ain ' t gon na take the . what ' s inside .
<person> ya mean , what ' s inside ?
of course , <person> . but as long as there ' s any question , better <person>ny should come back and clear his name .
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !
not if things worked out between us . i would ' ve told you everything eventually , and then it wouldn ' t be stalkerish . it would just be this sweet funny story we ' d have .
we ? !
but these men are my personal guards .
they are the bravest fighters in france .
nothing .
you ' re going to let her just wait there ?
no . i really don ' t . <continued_utterance> i dug her completely . <person> , i had found the last semi-guileless girl in new york city .
i have to get to sleep . truthfully -- i ' m also working mornings as a dental assistant .

i only want to bring him in when i know he ' ll never leave .
hey , careful there !
how do these work i wonder ? i got- ta save one to show the high aldwin .
deserters would have run , they wouldn ' t have engaged .

<person> , we missed you before .
i got held up . believe me , it is not something i make a habit of .
are you kidding ? <person> had to go out of town .
i ' m shocked .
sometimes . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s loss is france ' s gain .
i ' m not sure my new husband shares your opinion .
popularity has its price .
i have some excellent brandy here . would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the cardinal ?
are you a bull man ? august would hire you in a minute .
<person> ' t want the job . not for him . besides , i ' m not bull man . i just like big beasts . <continued_utterance> is she following ?
<person> !
you wicked old witch ! <person> , <person> , don ' t let ' em take <person> !
the sheriff !
he ' s got a warrant to arrest you !
his eagerness to leave his mother ' s womb also meant he was the one selected .

but that ' s not gon na happen with the attitude , it ' s not gon na happen with the lateness , it ' s not gon na happen by fighting me every step of the way -- ok , well not you , you ' re not late , but too much of that stuff goes on around here --
i am not late and i do not have an attitude -- well then don ' t tell me i ' m late if i ' m not late !
why this preoccupation with <person> ? time traveller why not ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t go simple on me , <person> ! time traveller if you want to know the truth , i don ' t much care for the time i was born into . - it seems people aren ' t dying fast enough these days . they call upon science to invent new , more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth . <continued_utterance> i quite agree with you . but here we are and we have to make the best of it .
you may have to . i don ' t . filby all right . take a journey on your contraption . what would you become ? . a greek ? a roman ? one of the pharaohs ? <continued_utterance> i prefer the future .
is he the one that killed <person> ?
no . but i ' m sure <person> ' s dead .
you was in the marines , huh ?
four years .
here he comes .
who sent you ?
have you ever thought that <person> doesn ' t want you to have a child ? that ' s why he fucking kills them before they ' re born . because you ' re fucking insane monsters that don ' t deserve a child .
you take that back !
we wanted you and <person> to have it someday . something real and honest .
we love our lives just the way they are .
does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? did she mention the police ?
no , but she ' s definitely pissed and hostile . and she ' s clearly starting to think that ' s something ' s not right .

i ' m still here , aren ' t i ? see this ? <continued_utterance> all this nothing ? it doesn ' t get to <person> like it gets to me . he says he don ' t mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
you could leave him .
<person> made me take them off , <person> . he took off his too .
you leave my son alone . <person> ' t go co ' rupt him with yer nastiness !
i hope so , too , mr . <person> . can i get you something to drink ?
a glass of water would be nice .
and i ' m honored that you want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ' t truly worthy --
i feel exactly the same way about you .
<person> ' the dream , baby . <person> ' the dream .
<person> .
that ' s what you said ?
that ' s not all i said . i said -- i can ' t believe those bastards -- i said we were great , i said people can come and sit and read for hours and no one bothers them , i said we stock <number> , <number> titles , i showed them the new york city section . i said we were a goddamn piazza where people could mingle and mix and be .
i didn ' t even know about it .
<person> , <person> . can you tell me what he looked like ?
you ' ve assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer , mr . <person> .
there is nothing common about <person> . <person> simply , he has turned money laundering into an art form . his greatest innovation : the false lawsuit . <continued_utterance> <person> sets up two companies : one is a casino in arizona for example and the other is a shell company in the cayman islands .
<person> ' t you see ? ! from being a pile of red dirt with minerals , <person> is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate .
and <person> ' s going to own it all !
well it ' s bad timing .
how do you figure ?
the leadership of our district . the diener . <person> is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except <person> , of course . he came the first day . i think he saved your life .
can i have something to drink ? <continued_utterance> does anybody know i ' m here ?
<person> how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss , dont know how you can criticize .

got work . i know a man who ' s got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .
you a sailor man ? that ' d be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .

a latte ' s fine . <person> ' s meet at the fountain opposite victoria ' s secret .

<person> , let ' s just see how closed it is . i ' ll go downstairs . you watch out the window and see if i ' m being tailed .

dr . <person> don ' t have that problem .
<person> ! its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head . right toward the bridge of the nose . lots and lots of irreparable damage .
<person> ! i knew you had it all under control .
i just thought it might be nice to do something together , that ' s all . thought it might be fun .
it doesn ' t sound like fun to me . you take the stuff you ' ve got here in the house , you take it someplace to eat it . it ' s just as much fun eating in front of the tv , and we do that together , don ' t we ? no ants and no bees . much more comfortable .
i ' d love it . <continued_utterance> but i can ' t . i really want to but i can ' t . it ' s bird intestine and beef brain .

i resent that innuendo ! my wife is completely innocent .
you think you ' ve found your calling ?
maybe . maybe . the call of the wild !
why not ?
because i guarantee she ' s married and has a couple kids . girls like <person> don ' t stay single .
stop it . i ' m sorry .
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .
<person> . <person> , <person> , you appear to possess-like many an aspiring writer before you , by the way-a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made . however , i ' think it ' s best if , for the moment at least . we abstain .
you ' re mad at me , aren ' t you ?
if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
sure . whatever you want . for old time sake . <continued_utterance> looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who ' s better than who , don ' t we , <person> ? like i said ; i expected more from you .
<person> to me , goddamn it . we ' re talking about a possible nuclear war . you dropped the ball on bay of pigs --
-- you sonofabitch , goddamn it , i didn ' t drop --
among others .
<person> and i are close friends !
oh .

it ' s a hellhole . three motels and a mannequin factory . my dad worked there for thirty-five years .
your father worked in a mannequin factory ?
call me back .
<person> . i ' ll call you back . in an hour . <person> ' t tell <person> .
but he never stays on that long ! sometimes he hangs up after just a couple of seconds .
it ' s the only way we can help you . by the way , what ' s your name ?
how late ?
no . just like an hour or so .
everyone has to follow his own plough . a man doesn ' t have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . city people don ' t give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . you don ' t plant old ways . . but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you . it ' s when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don ' t want it . you sell it to a stranger . you worked your whole life , for what ? i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm . all what we ' ve experienced has no meaning .
you ' re suppose to teach your children what you know . <person> , i don ' t have to worry about . <person> is a different story .
<person> little company . i remember when we got the money for bluestar to build those first planes , back in the fifties .
i hear you ' re buying teldar .
that ' s really it .
the one she wore on her wedding day ?
what ' s that ?
they ' ll know about it in the morning .
and you know what , it ' s not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it . but let ' s face it , nobody comes out of our rib .
was the dope in the diaper , yes or no ?
right ! he can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from earth . beach condos , ski resorts , you name it .
no wonder he wanted you to .
in some cases .
if that ' s really an einstein-rosen bridge out there , then there ' s something on the other side . <continued_utterance> <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> a . <continued_utterance> advanced beings could have come through it before .
i ' m hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun . by younger men .
younger men . <person> smiles disarmingly .
no . that ' s true , pal .
why ?
the agents who have worked out here say its like going into nam . <person> terrain , foreign language , foreign customs . and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds . they hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here .
were you in nam ?
who the fuck are you ?
you and i know each other . you found me on the internet .
tell me . please .
that i ' ll just . that one day i ' ll just . disappear . <person> . <person> ' s taken aback by this admission .
<person> ' s walkie-talkie . it ' s probably upstairs . find it . call the ranger base . my gun . see if you can find our stuff . my gun ' s in my backpack , side pocket .
what good ' s the gun ? you tossed away the bullets .
because , i don ' t know , because sometimes . sometimes i forget things . and ever since <person> left , ever since my daughter left for school , there ' ve been . i fainted and . why is this so hard ?
fireball ?
it sure didn ' t come from me . the tone of it in the game was very , very passionate , fanatical . and the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming . the whole thing felt unstable , dangerous , volatile . but worse than that , there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot . <person> game-systems , jumping ship from one game company to another . that kind of thing .
so which one of them did these elements come from ?
<person> ' t be such a pansy . all of this is yours .
it ' s a lot to digest . <person> how you ' d feel .
well . i don ' t know , <person> . what have you told him already ?
not much . he knows i don ' t have the highest opinion of him . and he knows i don ' t want to see him or know anything about him , ever . but i tried to keep it kind of neutral . <person> . i could go into a lot more detail , believe me .
listen to me carefully . first of all , <person> isn ' t here . dea ' s got him and they ' ll hang on to him until arraignment , which will probably be tomorrow . so here you ' re wasting your time . are you with me ? <continued_utterance> good . from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded , that the movement of your lips is being read .
<person> , this is crazy .
someone send you to tell me all this ?
you the one askin ' questions .
not until somebody gets a search warrant signed . it ' s sunday . i don ' t think they ' ve even found a judge , yet . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na have to call this in .
do what you ' ve got to do . so will i .
<person> , were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew .
yes , i was .
what ?
<person> killed a guy .
worse than <person> ?
<person> was a day at the beach next to this .
there ' s really nothing we can do about it down here . is the phone listed in your name ?
no , i ' m just the babysitter .
no way , man . here , i got the page marked .
<person> , but i ' m not sure i should try this on sheeni . i think this book is for people who ' ve been married so long they ' re disgusted by the sight of each other .
what if i ' m right , gloria ? what if i ' m right and <person> ' s wrong ? what do you do if you see a bad thing coming ? <continued_utterance> stick with me on this gloria . i need you .
and if the teeth aren ' t <person> ' s ? you ' ll give this up ?
he didn ' t give his name .
who ?
if it ' s that huge how would we carry it back ?
fine , we ' ll just start with something small . a squirrel or something .
is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a --
as a matter of fact , falling down was a tactic . lulling the destroyer into a false sense of security !
i forgot one more thing you will need to write down . <person> circulation is a chronic problem for people in my condition .
so . you think it could be a cure ?
you ain ' t got no credit card but you got a lawyer . <person> talk me all you want . <person> ' t you read the sign ? it says .
what sign ? fuck the sign . i want my car .
i meant no disrespect .
all right , then no more smashing , deal ?
<person> , <person> . go on home . we might have to call you in for some more questioning .
those girls are not the murderous type .

what kind of stupid question is that ?
i know .
what are you going to do with him ?
okay .
what okay ?
how would you like it if i read your journal ?
you can read it if you ' d like .
<person> , why don ' t you get to the point where you get to the point .
why is he giving you a gift ? <continued_utterance> did you give him a gift ?
<person> explains the continued success of `` heaven '' for how many decades ?

sometimes . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s loss is france ' s gain .
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it wouldn ' t really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door . what are you selling ?
bad news .

you know <person> and i are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother .
you are very sweet , but <person> has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him . he has a policy .
the queen invited you to dinner -

what are you doing here ?
the lieutenant was thirsty .
sure , if that ' s what you want . why not ? it ' s all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
need some help ?
no , no thanks . i ' d rather do it myself .
what was the money for ?
he didn ' t know . no one doing the deal knew except a few key people . this guy says they were real hush about it .

you tell me . you tell me who went to the b . i . a . -- bureau of indian annihilation and said i was messin ' with your case , man . i don ' t give a goddamn about your case .
i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission .
with all due respect , mr . secretary , we were not firing on the ship . firing on a ship means attacking the ship . we were not attacking the ship . we were firing over it .
why don ' t you come in , have a drink ?

oh , and he said ' no , ' huh ?
as a matter of fact , he said ' yes . ' <person> backs up against the wall , protecting his face with his arms . <person> leaves , disgusted . <person> watches him go , totally confused .
lot of good times , <person> .
a lot of good times , but i can ' t live off the good times . you know , my brother-in-law has offered me a job at hess shoes . i think maybe i should do it . you get there in the morning , you come home at night . you get health benefits . i get to be assistant manager .
yes , ma ' am , that ' s why i love it . and if you hit one good shot -- if that tuning fork rings in your loin -- you can ' t wait to get back . she cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night . it felt great and she knows it .
i think the big dog ate something .

how do you want it ?
people can see .
and that would ruin your reputation how ? <continued_utterance> what ' s that ?
of course she did . i just wasn ' t listening . but you need to listen now ! i promised her , i made her a solemn promise , that you would be safe with me . with me , <person> ! ! <continued_utterance> they ' ll never make a head count . there are too many of us . you can stay here - slip underneath the bed - until they move out .

but you never knew him .
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva ?
did you do it ? he didn ' t do it .
he wrote obscene words on the wall .
i could swear i heard my son call me .
you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there .
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --

maybe . maybe if we traded them the gold . if we gave it to them they might let us live ; they might not kill us . from o . c . we hear a voice:
<person> , i want you to know i blame myself for everything that happened .
so does everybody else .
it ' s really safe .

<person> ' t make me speak to you again .
those days are over , <person> . they were over a long time ago .

in hope of what ? learning that it ' s true ? ! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? !
let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable .
they kidnapped me . said they ' d kill you if i didn ' t cooperate . i told them i didn ' t care , but then when i realized they meant it .
i don ' t know why they ' re after me , but what ' s your connection with all this ?

well , of course , it ' s always dangerous .
i don ' t believe it . the mayor said she was the best bull you had .
if she was the best bull , why is she the only one left ? you think you ' re the first show to turn up picking on the bones ? <continued_utterance> some elephant tramp who dropped dead in genesee sold her for a song which still ain ' t no bargain cause she ain ' t done a damn thing since but eat everything in sight . well , good luck to ya . and if i don ' t ever see another dumb bull in my life it ' ll be too soon .

<person> ' s parents died in a car accident .
what are you talking about ?
i don ' t know . i . maybe this is . last year i sort of thought you were possibly interested in that . idea . but i was the one who , you know , wasn ' t `` ready '' at that point -- so that ' s why i thought things kind of slowed down with us .

i ' m not suggestin ' that ! i ' m not goin ' back . no matter what happens . so don ' t worry about me . <person> speeds up . <continued_utterance> can i ask you kind of a weird question ?

you expect me to think at a time like this ? there isn ' t a drop of blood in my brain .
but they discount .
but they don ' t provide any service . we do . <continued_utterance> so really it ' s a good development . you know how in the flower district , there are all these flower shops in a row so you can find whatever you want . well , this is going to be the book district .

<person> is it ?
pride and prejudice .

where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends ? they all smell of moth balls .
they ' re not after me . they want the baby .
who is this baby ?
you did ?
of course . but , d ' <person> , if this spy was to find out you are here , your life could be in grave danger .
you ' d lie to protect him .
probably .
i don ' t see patients on vacation , <person> . ever . how many ways can i make that clear ?
but you can ' t just send me away ! i ' ve read your book , i ' ve been doing what you told me , but i ' ve completely relapsed ! a little time would mean so much . <person> .

why is this kid staring at me ?
i ' m not sure .
they are english . they don ' t understand .
i wish dawdie was with us .

i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks .
think so ? you know what chickens do if one chicken ' s born with a little difference ? with a few black feathers on its head , say ? they peck at the black spot ' til the chicken ' s dead -- they can ' t stand the fact that it ' s different . now we ' re both different . your difference is something other than . . my difference . but we ' re both aliens here .
i don ' t exactly feel like an alien . i ' ve got friends here .

for instance , if a child is having trouble getting to sleep , what would you do ?
depends , if it was a continuing problem , i might recommend a mild sedative .
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you ' re what i want . the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about <person> . but i ' ve had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we ' ve got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
you said you couldn ' t kill anybody .
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .
no , and yes . i don ' t know what i ' m going to do about <person> . i know he is seeing someone else and that ' s okay with me , and he thinks i ' m seeing someone else and that ' s not okay with him .
are you going to tell him about that `` someone else '' ?
ok . i will . if that ' s what you want . but i have to be honest , i ' m not sure that ' s what <person> wants .
what do you mean ?
i ' m <continued_utterance> you really think it could ' ve dropped off an airliner ?
sure . it ' s halogen . you oughta report it . you coming for a drink ?

i ' m pregnant . <continued_utterance> i ' m sure .
<person> , it ' s <person> at base , come back .
go for , <person> . <continued_utterance> restrain him .
what ?
well -- i don ' t know .
why don ' t we just sacrifice something small -- a rabbit maybe . or a duck . that ' d be good , don ' t you think ?
no ! a duck would not be good !
i ' m looking for him .
looking for him for what ? <continued_utterance> feds are looking for him , too . <person> nice business he ' s got , huh ?
you ' re not getting any penetration , even with the elephant gun .
<person> ! <person> , we can ' t get them . never figured on having to shoot through dirt ! best goddamn bullet stop there is . come back .
what ? ! what ' s up with all the genital mutilation ?
trust me , after a while you don ' t even miss them .
i wanted to humiliate the guy . here i am , out busting my ass all day making a decent living , i come home , and some schmuck is trying to steal from me .
so you hit him with a gun , and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes ?
i don ' t mean who you ' re thinking . i have other friends .
<person> , <person> . this is me , <person> , you ' re talking to . we both know you don ' t have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit . <continued_utterance> here , <person> . i want you : o look this over . know what it is ? <person> deposited his check , transferred the funds to an offshore bank , a numbered account . not even the cops can find out whose names are on it . think one of them ' s yours ? <continued_utterance> he also put a down on some island property , and a lease-to-buy on a forty-foot sailboat . you ' re into sailing , aren ' t you , <person> ?
why ? it does .
no , it doesn ' t . just kiss me .
i don ' t understand . are you wanting us to jack a game into our bioports ?
game ? no . not a game . a weapon . you go back to the trout farm , and in a familiar place , you find a mouldy old wicker basket with a thread-bare canvas cover .
the state department ' s gon na pull the plug on <person> ? ! <person> my french -- but whose fucking side are you on ?
. i work for everybody . if there is a transition of power , i facilitate a relationship with the new people . if there is not , i facilitate the status quo . <person> way , i facilitate .
<person> . <continued_utterance> what ' s gotten into you ? <continued_utterance> ow !
what ' s the matter ?
a basic kill . <person> was a drifter and nobody knew her . my boys have been all over this . it ' s a dead end .
that ' s why we ' re here , <person> .
stand still . i want you to remember this in the morning .
if you want me to remember something in the morning , then tell it to me in the morning .
<person> about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people .
<person> , it ' s not your fault , and it ' s not your decision .
i am . what do you want ?
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way .
what ' s the best way to qualify a mark ?
what ?
this kid is good . so just . you know . be ready out there .
can you give me a slap ?
c ' mon , <person> , when did you ever take a crazy risk ?
i fell for you .
you ' re asking if we ' re involved ?
i ' m asking how much .

of course ! i promise ! <continued_utterance> come to daddy , little darlin ' . i think she likes me !
then why don ' t you run off with him ? what are you waiting for ?
i don ' t actually know him .
first pack of tailor-mades i had in a while . <continued_utterance> you must be my son .
<person> hands with your daddy .
so you ' re hot on this stock ?
it ' s ready to take off . i ' d jump all over it if i were you .
who ' s this `<person> ' clown anyway ?
not important .
you know what i ' m going to do ? i ' m just going to take a second . i want to look at the gold .
<person> ' t you touch it .
madmartigan .
who is he ?
it seemed like a low-percentage shot .
so am i ! look at me . i ' m playing for . . <person> short-haul trucking , brink and <person> , <person> of salome , <person> ' s smokehouse . you think a guy like me bothers to think about the percentages ? --
<person> --
i need an introduction to the obregon brothers .
you wont of missed much .
see ya downstairs .
what ' re you doing here ?
i have some news for you .
what kind of seats can we have ?
not padded ones .
<person> ? <continued_utterance> do you love me ?
christ , sure . yes !
<person> ? that you , <person> ?
yes , maam . whats on your almost- perfect mind this evening ?
did you pork her <person> ?
no . but i wanted to .
no way . <continued_utterance> i ' m not calling and cancelling on daly . you call and cancel on daly .
you ' re scared to cancel on daly .
i think he said he was going to <person> ' s room .
but that ' s where <person> is . who are you ?
i ' d have been bored here on my own . there ' s more than enough room for two .
i can see that .
<person> , what are you going to need to clean it up
more people . got ta pick up where <person> left off . <person>eople from outside the department .
sure -- i just about believe you .
hey , <person> -- what ' s on a tree ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! way to go , <person> -- pretty smart . oh , i was wondering , <person> -- i wanted to ask you something : how ' s the world treating you ? <continued_utterance> rough ! yeah , i know what you mean .
you ' re the only thing i care about . always will be .
oh mom .
if ! if there ' s a treasure .
yeah . if . whatever . what kind you figure it is ?
you ' re having it .
i don ' t want to !
what ?
with . with millions . millions of dollars .
i don ' t hate you --
but you ' ll never forgive me . <person> .
red hot . her thighs steam .
<person> . she ' s pretty good in bed , then ?
<person> , back up . you lied ?
kinda . yeah . <continued_utterance> so what do you want to see ?
no -- <person> -- that was him . but that was him . i wish it wasn ' t , but it was .
no it wasn ' t .
yes . i am .
then why don ' t you run off with him ? what are you waiting for ?
promise you ' ll look in my eyes the whole time .
i promise .
no , stay . please stay with me .
<person> , i got ta start makin ' money .
i ' m sorry . professor tripp . maybe it ' s seeing that jacket that belonged to her . it just looks . really lonely . hanging there . in a closet . maybe i ' m just a little sad .
maybe . i ' m feeling a little sad myself tonight .
i ' m sure you ' re mistaken . you musta told me before .
no , i would have told you `` <person> . `` only my grandmother , who ' s dead , ever called me <person> .
<person> well , but i don ' t see how i am to live with him . my mother values my indentured servitude .
you must influence her to send you away . i feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part .
<person> ?
ever since the accident i ' ve been worried that you ' d been unhappy , or .
looks like we ' re in for a long , uncomfortable trip .
we ' ll all breathe a lot easier when we get this cargo back to london .
negligent . yes . it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .
thank you .
like the lady herself .
she was small . most people don ' t know that . the shoulders are small . it looks so perfect . i bet it ' s the only time she wore it . that day . she must ' ve felt so . happy . <continued_utterance> it ' s feels unreal , like butterfly wings or . something . it must ' ve cost dr . <person> a lot .
ah --
<person> next !
so howd he finally nail you ? right there in the kitchen ?
no , he picked me up .
as you can see , there ' s a lot to do .
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind .
we ' ll think of something .
oh , praise the lord .
i am on a salt free diet .
do you always hold hands with reporters ?
did you hear the way he screamed at me ? he wasn ' t alone .
everybody likes a conspiracy . it ' s more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing . <continued_utterance> well , what are we going to do out here ? do you know your way around ? you know any country people ?
yeah . but i never believe her anyway .
you should , she ' s your mother . respect that . can you turn that down ? i hate that judge . i wouldn ' t be in this place if it wasn ' t for her .
you know damn well , dead-man .
hey , that was your mistake , not mine . did you ever think to ask me ? i ' ve been
i am an actress .
there ' s probably not too much you aren ' t great at .
love .
yes , that is one reason .
that ' s cop bullshit .
well , you ' re half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
molly , really , this isn ' t .
<person> ?
this doesn ' t make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air .
he will be alright .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . <person> ' ll think maybe me and <person> went away . buy us some time . i know a back road we can take .
<person> thinking . what ' s all this ?
man , you are really --
look : i ' m tryin ' to be polite . so would you just take off ? it ' s ok : just take off .
oh . that ' s my dad . <continued_utterance> he can ' t talk . had a major stroke a few years back . but he ' s doing well . <person> ' t ya <person> ?
ok , well , thanks for your time . here ' s my number in case you hear of anything . <person> to bother you .
it ' s show time . <person> ' t look at the flash . do not look at the flash .
we ' re safe here .
<person>isy <person> place ?
how ' d you know ?
pretty harsh , isn ' t it ?
<person> times , brother . we ' re in the middle of a famine . people are starving . if we don ' t get some rain soon , it could get ugly . then we ' ll get to start kicking ass big time . he stops to flog a beggar with his hand out . cain beat it , you filthy beggar !
i know !
. it would just be this sweet funny story we ' d have .
what ' s the acreage here ?
roughly twelve hundred or so . why ?
well , try .
as an example . i came home last night , i get undressed , and i realize you ' re sleeping on my side of the bed . i ' ve always slept on that side . it ' s something i ' ve always done .
yeah , i do .
incoming , dude .
sure .
you can let me down now .
stop .
. would do anything just to be around me . and i slipped . god help me , i slipped .
so , who is it anyway -- <person> or <person> ?
<person> . <person> , enchanting <person> .
just asking .
i don ' t want to see any more beef jerky . i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window . it ' s drivin ' me crazy . the whole car smells like it .
oh sure , <person> .
who are these orphans , anyway ?
something like that .
keep me abreast will you ? chief <person> is understandably nervous . situations like these tend to yield grief . and we ' ve the fbi poking around our garden patch .
we ' ll see about that .
<person> , we will .
fireball ?
you ' re joking .
oh my , he would have been so proud . you ' re the spitting image of him .
he never spits , ma ' am . ever . he can ' t even get a good hocker going . i ' ve tried to teach him . it comes from the diaphragm .
i stole a car .
what ? you ' re don ' t even drive .
i can ' t let you in there .
where is <person> , <person> ? she ' s in that room , isn ' t she ?
what party ? a party ?
the party . remember ? red dress . strappy shoes . i spilled something on your shirt . sweet and sour . and the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
when did you make the switch ?
it ' s always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i ' d better . take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
somebody tried to kill me .
mr . <person> , wow , you had quite a day . eh ? we got chasing , we got shooting .
you fingered <person> for his father ' s disappearance and pressed me to do the same to cover your ass !
he was the prime suspec-
what kind of trip ? i thought you were working with him .
i was .
we found you .
yes . now that you have , what will you do ?
dressed ?
dinner . with <person> and his new girl .
you think you influenced her ?
maybe . i don ' t know . i just know that when all this was happening , i felt , some part of me felt . alive . <person> somebody needed me . and the more i reached out to , it , the fuller it became .
the hell you didn ' t !
the hell i did !
sort of .
what part of <person> ' s body was injured ?
well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gon na get that <person> back here and away from that murderer .
<person> aint a murderer . you got to get off that kick . and fars i can tell , <person> was entire clean prior to that involvin <person> . even there he was protectin her . you oughta be thankin him for that . that <person> lemon they say was comin after the both of em . why am i tellin you this , you was around that night . you ought to know just exactly what happened . <person> just got a little too forceful is all . you remember that night .
<person> is not fair .
you ' re right .
well , you ' re not exactly an expert witness , but what makes you so sure ?
if waitin ' tables in a bar don ' t make you an expert on human nature , then nothin ' will , and i could ' ve told you that <person> would end up buyin ' it in a parkin ' lot . i ' m just surprised it didn ' t happen before now .
i doctored my grades so i ' d make the cut . i ' m a moron , okay ? you satisfied ? !
you ' re not a moron .
the stuff we got last night .
<person> laxative ? we can ' t snort baby laxative .
that ' s reassuring .
<person> - the world is my office .
ain ' t it there ?
no it ain ' t there . would i be asking if it were there ?
thats not why i called .
oh yeah - sure . okay .
ok . <person> . could you just take a look at my radiator hose . it ' s busted . <continued_utterance> so ?
it ' s your radiator hose . it ' s busted .
it ' s only a man without a head who could do a thing like that . <person> little bee . cu - dorothy reacts - reaches o . s . -
oh , there .
a glimmer .
<person> to stir it around a little ?
who ?
president <person> . <continued_utterance> i know , i know . but there ' s an untold story here . i mean , the man has a point of view too , right ? <continued_utterance> we got a national anthem contest going on right now , and you guys are ignoring it . <person> human interest . <person> turns to other business though hub persists .
what about legalizing everything ?
fine -- legalization . <person> , forgetting all of our international trade agreements , legalize everything today . the government inserts itself into all drug transactions . the u . s . becomes a giant pharmacy . our borders are mobbed , lines of people from here to europe wanting to smoke , snort and shoot themselves into oblivion .
<person> ? do you think it might be a good idea if i moved in with him ?
<person> , that just wouldn ' t work . i depend on that child support money to eat .
so , we ' re all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
more or less .
<person> , what ' s a daikini ?
daikinis are giant people who live far far away .
well . i mean like <person> bein in a family way .
<person> tell you shes pregnant ? <person> grins , showing those three brown teeth .
no .
there was a time when i would ' ve given my life for a kind word .
she sure this was the park they were coming to ?
yup . <person> ' s already offering up a reward .
<person> , mrs . <person> .
right . <person> , lem me tell you something . with a child you always know who the mother is , but the father -- that ' s another kettle of fish . so don ' t give me that bullshit , okay ?
like what ?
do things together that are enjoyable .
then why didn ' t you help him ?
i was afraid , okay ? somehow , i was sure it was <person> at that point . i couldn ' t bring myself to raise my gun to him .
<person> , what ' re you gon na do with that gun ?
i ' m gon na save them , of course . you go for help . <person> at the terminal bar . she ' ll know what to do .
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals .
<person> , bless your bones . but the problem grows .
it ' s pretty good , you know -
oh , i ' d only disappoint , you . <person> - i ' m not . qualified . i can spell .
well , he sure ' s hell can ' t sue you for slander . that boy fights for the pink team . did you make him cry ?
well . he was just ready to . i called him a big-assed , squat- to-pee sissy . i ' d have won bigger except he hit me when i wasn ' t looking .
maybe you should talk to <person> . owns a marine salvage company . nobody knows more about the strait .
where can i find him ?
who ?
all of them . everybody waiting on that dock .
<person> , why did you do this ? please just tell us . <person> needs to be in a home .
this is where he belongs .
russell prefers pictures to words .
you don ' t have to apologize . you ' re journalists .
and , oh my god , that other thing , that pointing to your lap ? what ' s that supposed to mean exactly ? does that mean pull over , i want to show you what a big fat slob i am or .
does that mean suck my dick ?
the great who ?
the great porthos . me , you idiot . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you know who i am ?
yeah . war horse . and there he is . what a strange beast you ' ve become .
and now ?
it ' s a combat action .
it ' s murder , and i won ' t be any part of it .
<person> ' t worry about it , all right ?
<person> , i hate sounding so clinical all the time . all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well , but then i .
very well .
<person> . and will you bring the others with you ? filby whatever you say , <person> . - <person> . time traveller and a very happy new year to you , <person> .
his bag . you know that ratty green thing he ' s always carrying around . he must ' ve left it inside .
hh-uh . last time i saw it was .
he was trying to find me . we had an argument .
i think you ' d be making a big mistake if you married him .
and yours ?
you think you ' ve stopped it . what i ' ve worked for fifty years to create . you haven ' t stopped it . you can ' t stop it . you ' re just one man .
can we just get back to <person> ?
the quartet is part of the bit about <person> . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing i had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than i did . they knew all of us .
oh , right . you ' re probably not a virgin anymore . but as far as being a hack , that much is status quo .
what do you want from me ? i ' m trying to be fair . but i can ' t keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .
why ?
it ' s sacrilegious .
well . i should get back to work . <person> ' ll be down soon and that path ain ' t gettin ' clear on its own .
excuse me . <person> ?
no , he said not to tell anyone .
but this is an emergency !
give me the cardinal ' s treaty .
no .
fan works .
now what ?
you first .
no way ! it was your idea . you go first .
i don ' t know .
the world ' s gone insane . good men locked in cages , criminals running free . it doesn ' t pay to be honest , <person> .
<person> , <person> , i ' m kinda impressed . faking your suicide is pretty ballsy .
so where you headed ?
just had to get the pack unhooked from the line . it didn ' t seem that long .
not when you ' re up here with the gold , i guess not . throwing <person> ' own words back at him:
i think i have to meet this <person> .
yeah . he ' s a pretty funny dude .
<person> ' t play babe in the woods with me . i know that guy from the gym came to see you .
<person> ? i didn ' t tell him anything , <person> .
nourish is a double agent for cortical systematics . he was working with <person> to subvert the realist cause , and doing it rather well . <continued_utterance> after all , he got you to assassinate your own contact . but now you ' re going to put a stop to him .
we are ?
you did a great job . she ' s a good kid .
we did .
<person> on . <person> on a minute , damnit .
. only for one day and we ' ll be back tomorrow night .
<person> . <person> ' t get all melancholy over the thirty seconds you were single a long time ago .
that ' s what you think i ' m doing ?
he ' s always been good at oral exams .
get out to the pipeline . find the insider who switched the pin . if your instincts are right , <person> will be back . he hasn ' t completed the job . the pipeline is still going forward , and we have <person> to thank for that .
my god . have you had to . have sex with other women in the line of duty ?
i don ' t take those assignments .
we ' re close to something here -- we ' re on the verge --
you ' re on the verge , <person> -- please don ' t do this to me --
nope . <person> .
<person> around ?
not bad . i just won the state lottery .
<person> . <person> .
i thought it only fair you should know , given how hard you ' ve worked .
what happened to <person> ?
say it again .
what ?
<person> , you ' re funny .
it ' s a puzzle box . if you can figure out how to open it there ' s supposed to be a treasure inside .
things could be better .
we thought you ' d be asleep --
oh .
wan na come in and wait for her ?
no . no , thank you .
you ' re sure you ' re alright , sir ?
first of all , he didn ' t tell me anything : <person> did . ok ? second of all , i don ' t really give a shit if you took him to play pool : i was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain . but no , i don ' t want you telling him not to squeal , because i don ' t want him put in that position !
well . that . is a perfect example of what i ' m talking about .
and you never told nobody about it ?
just you . <person> never acted strange or different after . and he never did anything else to me . i always got a nice present from him at christmas , like a coat or jewelry ?
i can ' t . and i won ' t .
come on , we both like <person>dy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top . it doesn ' t fit .
i got the golden tassel to sponsor you at the open .
you expect me to pack that around ?
ever since the accident i ' ve been worried that you ' d been unhappy , or .
the accident . ?
<person> , well , like my <person> used to say . you can ' t change your christmas past , but you sure can exchange your christmas presents .
why don ' t you come to town this weekend ? we could play some golf , chase some skirts .
hi peter , i ' m looking for <person> , have you seen him ?
oh hi , <person> , how are you doing ? yeah , sure , i ' ll take you to <person> . excuse me for a minute . <continued_utterance> you ' re a lifesaver , i ' ve been trying to get away from that woman

these burns . my arms . ouch .
yes i knew .
can you hold , i have another call ?
and .
he saw an owl .
through the forehead ?
yes .
and i have no idea why .
i do .
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her .
what happened in those three .
he ' s already called , dr . <person> . twice . he ' s coming in this afternoon .
that ' s one kind of persistence . <person> fensterwald . ?
how do you know what she doesn ' t like ?
oh , leland , sit down and eat you dinner .
i aint never met anyone come close to you , sugar .
recall the time we was sittin one night behind the confederate soldier ? leanin against it . and you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said , you feel it beatin in there , <person> ? . <person> used to it , cause it belongs to you now . dyou recall that ?
i ' d say it ' s exactly as advertised .
<person> , it ' s ugly . even for a game- pod .
<person> . i cant .
<person> . its all right . also , i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed .
it ' s a big old tree trunk , you paranoid gook .
<person> . iyah ! <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
you drove us here , that ' s what you did ! ! what the hell did you think you were doing ! ?
i thought i was driving you home .
there ' s no way . i can ' t , he ' s suicidal . why don ' t you call <person> and tell him you ' ll be there in a few hours .
you ' re crazy . <person> is leaving in an hour . if i don ' t meet him before then , i blow my <number> , <number> dollar contract .
iandiacute ; ll tell you one thing though .
whatandiacute ; s that ?
it ' s the right thing to do .
but <person> won ' t let you .
no . you just said i couldn ' t let him in the house . <continued_utterance> <person> , where are we going ?
home .
i don ' t have a goddamn credit card .
now that ' s too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit ' cause you ' re gon na have to work this one off . <person> proffers his movado watch .
i need your help .

<person> ' t be afraid of him none . i don ' t care what he does to you , we can still be together .

we were running <person> . that ' s all i can tell you . but i want it , <person> . i ' ve got a call into schaeffer .
if you find out what i want to know , and if i ' m able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath .
you ' re one sick bastard . a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . i think no matter which way i go i ' m likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . so here ' s my answer : kiss my ass , hop-along . <continued_utterance> not bad for a gimp .

they keep him confined ? that ' s bullshit !
where do you get off speaking about me like that , making remarks to the press , i resent these remarks , i demand the right to speak .
<person> down , sir , you ' re out of order , haven ' t you done enough damage to teldar as it is ? . have you no sense of decency ? how can your management . <continued_utterance> . concentrate on long term growth when we ' re busy fighting the get- rich-quick , short term profit , slot machine mentality of wall street when we should be fighting japan ! the original fundamental reason for wall street was to capitalize american business , underwrite new business , build companies , build america . the `` deal '' has now succeeded goods and services as america ' s gross national product and in the process , we are undermining our foundation . this cancer is called `` greed '' . <person> and speculation have replaced long-term investment . corporations are being taken apart like erector sets , without any consideration of the public good . i strongly recommend you to see through mr . <person> ' s shameless intention here to strip this company and severely penalize the stockholders . i strongly recommend you to reject his tender by voting for management ' s restructuring of the stock .
<person> ' t i be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? the world is not black and white . show me one perfect person .
i do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start . you have no right to complain to us about your not having enough . you sit right there with your no manners self .
or desperation . depends on the day . <continued_utterance> i ' ll get there though . i ' ll get there .
<person> .

phoenix .
<person> ' ve needed it . <continued_utterance> oh , by the way , you didn ' t happen to hear a funny pinging noise in the engine , did you ?

i don ' t know what you did to him , or said to him , or what . but he ' s really pissed off at you ! what did you do ?
i ' m all finished . now what ?
burn it to a fine ash .
she ' s missing . we ' ve been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in .
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
<person> . <person> got a little , you know , enthusiastic .
you ' ll never believe who ' s in there .
my dad gets me all the books i want .

i said i never heard of him .
but <person> had . <person> was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .
indian music . so we ' re a checkin ' the ins files , see if we can get some prints that match . you wouldn ' t know anyone who might have stolen the car who listens to this crap , would ya , son ?
no , and i ' m not sure i like the implication . <person> is beloved by many caucasian .
what wouldn ' t ?
repeating this life . over and over .
not really .
this kid is six foot two , two hundred and forty pounds . he runs the fifty in under six seconds . he ' s going to be a god . <person> . <person> studies the excitement in her eyes .
can ' t ! can ' t ! can ' t !
i tell you , i could fly around this room with my eyes closed !
or did you steal it from your old friend <person> ?
. what ?
this is a terrible mistake !
i ' m acting from the heart so i can ' t make a mistake ? ! right ?
yeah .
did you see that one , what ' s the one -- it looks like a big `` w '' ? cassiopeia ?
what kind of research ?
mapping the fucking pig genome . we ' ll call your dad , he ' s a neurosurgeon --
you ' re bad --
<person> , that ' s all --
<person> won the turkey shoot .
oh , boy . now we ' re in for it -- he thinks he ' s some kind of big hunter .
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world ' s most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
i had very little .
<person> little ! ! you eat like an animal ! it couldn ' t have been very little .
how do you know ? they might .
' cause they ' re getting a divorce . that ' s why they sent me here . my sister ' s at tabor . they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business .
well --
i think you should .
no cabs .
<person> !
this is a friendly place , son . you folks just relax and have a nice time .
you got yourself a deal .
riots broke out at the world cup soccer finals -
<person> bites man . <person> bites dog is a news story . riots at the world cup soccer finals is a social announcement . next ?
what ! what ! oh shit ! oh no ! <continued_utterance> what do we do ? what do you want to do ? !
i don ' t know ! <person> ! let ' s just play it by ear . he may not know . he may just give me a ticket .
those are sterile , are they ?
not to worry . they way they set things up , you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection .
heavy . <person> like gunpowder .
caps .
who are you ?
they are journalists .
or maybe you just think you do . just another small town . one guy chasing you . you go big town . just gon na have four guys after you instead . <person> kissy kiss . it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? cause you got ta remember you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , that ' s where you gon na be .
i think i ' ve heard that before .
you ' ve got it solved ? where is she ?
she ' s going to be fine .
close .
although it feels like such a failure . it feels like i ' m quitting . it feels like . mom . she closes her eyes .
now how ' s this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice , huh ?
i don ' t know how . because he ' s different than we are . because he ' s a space guy . what do you want from me , anyway . go ask <person> .
you might say so , lionel .
who ?
i . given the limits of your question , that ' s correct .
the <person>s were not negligent .
no ! the gods demand a sacrifice ! and you ruined it !
why don ' t we just sacrifice something small -- a rabbit maybe . or a duck . that ' d be good , don ' t you think ?
oh . i thought that ' s not it anyway . i know this doesn ' t make any sense to you , but i just can ' t turn it off that fast . i still feel something for her .
<person> , tell you what : i ' ll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan .
what is happening here ?
it ' s just -- the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall . so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down .
suicide . we think . forty stories . <person> fall . <person> . <continued_utterance> now our records show that <person> made several calls to this number just before he died . did either of you know <person> personally ?
<person> called here trying to reach his psychiatrist .
i ' m feeling a little disconnected from my real life . i ' m kind of losing touch with the texture of it , you know what i mean ? i mean , i actually think there ' s an element of psychosis involved here . i mean , i don ' t know where my body really is , or where reality is , what i ' ve actually done , or not done .
that ' s a great sign . it means your nervous system is fully engaging with the game architecture . the game is a lot more fun when it starts to feel realer than real .
there ' s no body , and nothing was taken except <person> .
he does know how to delegate doesn ' t he . and also i ' m sure that poor negro ' s nosedive has put you squarely in his debt .
but the bullseye on your back ' s never been quite so big . if you need a new line of work , i got this faygele leading man needs replacing- <continued_utterance> his agent told me he could play straight .
his agent lied .
thank you . for saving my life .
you don ' t have to thank me . up here , we take care of one another . that ' s the only way any of us survive .
you think i care about her ? iandiacute ; m the only one whoandiacute ; s sure to walk out of here . <person> .
then why donandiacute ; t you kill her . this catches logan a little off guard . magneto go on . kill her . you can do it
you mean because his career ' s ruined and all ?
jesus . is that what he told you ?
if you need a razor , there are some back there with my name on them .
august .
what ' s this ? <person> speaks ? of course i have the hots for her and i ' m doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till i kick <person> ' ass and show her i ain ' t who she thinks i am because , in fact , i am who she thinks i am but if i win the open i won ' t be .
well , i don ' t think her nor me nor the god of golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the open .
how long has he been with you ?
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
<person> ' t give up ! <person> !
<person> !
. but it ' s always really good to know that wherever i am , whatever stupid shit i ' m doing , you ' re back at my home , rooting for me .
i do root for you .
try ass wipe of the universe .
ass wipe of the universe !
i guess i ' m with you .
was it my speech ?
yes , that ' s what i want . thanks d .
<person> , l . i am your friend . always . but sometimes . lately . i feel that you don ' t like being around me because i am so uptight . no , i am uptight . i hate it . i don ' t want to be this way , but <person> i don ' t . i mean . i ' m your friend no matter what way you are .
i ' ve scheduled a medical for you .
it ' s barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .
we can ' t just sit here waiting to die .
you come up with a better plan , let me know .
you can ' t visit me here . i want my lawyer .
the amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states .
do you think polio has affected your husband ' s mind ?
yes , i do . i certainly do .
then brother let ' s you and me cut out .
right with you , brother .
what ? ! what about him ? !
just the look on his face when you . . it ' s not funny .

sheeni , i have shown restraint , i have committed crimes , i have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you won ' t give me this one little thing .
we ' ve got to get out .
we can ' t .
what is your wife ' s picture doing by the side of your .
what is that to you . ?
yes . but what am i running from ?
and for heaven ' s sake , practice your horsemanship .
full stop ! ! ! call the captain !
<person> !
i like girls .
so we have that in common --
nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .
is that the truth ?
no sir . but , but i look nineteen and i ' m bigger than most nineteen-year- olds , sir ! and i ' m strong , sir ! and i . i ' m not afraid of anything .
yes ! finally . now you ' re talking ! should i enter it right here or should we go back to your bedroom ? does the holy of holies like to be entered from behind or -- ?
that ' s the holy of holies -- you have to go in there and talk to the gods .
because she ' s small and we ' re big . how about we go get some candy ?
so now she ' s gone and it ' s all your fault .
your daughter .
she ' s late ? she ' s probably at the store buying some crap or something .
i want you to leave .
what do you mean ?
<person> ?
yeah ?
what the hell are we doing ? we ' re doing all this together , trusting each other , making plans , and we haven ' t even slept together yet .
that gives us something to live for .
need me for what , mama ? im perfectly fine , and safe , too .
you in a dance hall or somethin ?
hows it look ?
reckon the heads cracked , like i thought .
oh , <person> , why do you want me to stay ? you don ' t even like me , not really .
you ' re not leaving !
sixteen
live with your parents ?
you know , i want to thank you for getting me into this class . no way was my old man going to spring for the fees .
hey , you ' re working for it . least you ' re supposed to be .
they were the ones that put us together .
because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
and let me guess who is .
i ' m the one ' s got the big stick .
lets go by <person> . you been there yet ?
no , havent heard of it .
<person> thinking maybe ?
someone send you to tell me all this ?
<person> , you never order duck salad .
well , that ' s true . i don ' t . i think someone else is asking for it .
no . nothing like that .
where you headed ?
<person> to explain . very hard .
well , try .
who knows , baby ?
he was sittin there havin a beignet at the cafe du monde . do you think he saw us ?
<person> ?
we ' ve got a lot in common .
he cared enough to want you to have it .
he phoned it in .
<person> ! <person> down .
i won ' t calm down . i can ' t do this . we can ' t do this . it won ' t work . it will not work .
just an hour ? you should tell this stud to take more time .
will you shutup . i should never have told you about him .
no . but it ' s not something i
no big deal . just your average day in the nhl .
no <person> ' s . a- <number> , <person> .
<person> ?
last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country .
i hope when you were on the bench , judge <person> , you didn ' t handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion .
<person> , i was just about to give up on you .
well -- maybe it would ' ve been better if you had . <continued_utterance> i mean -- look , i don ' t mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation , whatever it is , but i ' m just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions , they might end up having a lot less trouble generally . that ' s all .
sure . once or twice .
when i was twelve , i had one buzz me for three weeks . <continued_utterance> whoa . you got some heavy stuff here . denial of death , <person> and trembling , sickness unto death .
i ' m leaving <person> .
he ' s smooth , right ? he probably has mistresses in every european city , too .
they might . yes . that ' s the point . is that they might . you see , the jury wants to believe . they ' re all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . i ' m going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it ' s written on their face , ' this is a sham . there is no justice . ' but in their heart they ' re saying , ' maybe . maybe . '
maybe what ?
its okay . i hardly used to see them anyway . i didn't have much parental guiding . the public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin . he was a good ol boy , stood by me . even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time .
id stand by you , sailor . through anything .
<person> vas , z ' opa . <person> up !
i ' ve got meetings this afternoon , i ' ve got to get some sleep . just pick a girl .

<person> .
in a pig ' s eye . he ' s english , plain to see .
oh , you mean because he ' s so filthy ?
no , it doesn ' t . <person> , look , i see what you ' re doing here , and that ' s , i ' m sorry , but that ' s not it . my marriage is fine . i ' ve had some kind of `` empty-nest '' episode where i saw some things that weren ' t there . <person> ' s deal with that . i ' m willing to deal with that . i just don ' t want to go conjuring problems where none exist .
<person> enough . but you should know that i ' m far less concerned with whether things you saw `` existed , '' than i am with why you saw them . she takes in the ramifications of that .
whadda ya think ?
oh , this looks great , <person> !
<person> me a cola .
fifty cents .
huh . and why is that ?
because she was anemic . it ' s right there on her chart . her brain was getting less oxygen anyway .
come on , don ' t front like that . you ' ll put a guy right off you .
<person> ' t even bother , x man , i ' m not your type .
he looked like one of the monkees .
<person> , <person> slept with him .
my leg is falling asleep .
it ' s not falling asleep . you ' ve only been standing there for three minutes .
we ' ll put in a word with the big boys . maybe you ' ll just get exile to venus .
all right . here comes the weapon .
it has a trigger . i pulled it .
can i see it ?
not yet . by now , he ' s stashed <person> , so he ' s travelling solo .
who ' s this `<person> ' clown anyway ?
that how you planned it ? you take cut <person> , get me to hang it on kelly , then dump me in the ocean .
come off it , man . it was an accident .
anything you want .
nothing .
<person> talk down to me , <person> farragut . i know what volition means , and thats why i want <person> off the planet ! hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby . maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead . youd only be defendin yourself , and with his record , nobodyd fuss .
<person> locate <person> , <person> , and if shes with the ripley boy , <person> give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me . thats about all i can do .
well , i don ' t think i ' ve seen you since the reception at dean ackerman ' s last year . <continued_utterance> for the dupont chair . i swear . i ' m becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst .
no . i ' m just not sure what you mean .

you ' re in love .

three days later , he called me . he told me to meet him at overlook park .
she didn ' t have enough business .
why ?

you got him wrong .
do i ? <person> was under indictment a total + of seven times when he was on the force . + in every case , witnesses either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before they could testify . when they t finally did nail him for fraud , he spent + five years in sing sing . he killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death . of course i can ' t prove this but i can ' t prove the best part either . kujan pauses to drink some coffee . <continued_utterance> dean <person> was dead . did you know that ? r he died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into the murder of a witness who was going to testify against him . two people saw <person> enter a warehouse he owned just before it went up . they said he had gone in to check a + leaking gas main . it blew up and took all of dean <person> with it . within three months of the explosion , the two witnesses were dead , one killed himself in his car and the other fell down an open elevator shaft .
never even heard of anything like it .
i just thought of somethin ' i never thought about before . i don ' t want to go to hell .
those boys never did have good luck .
you damn right they didn ' t , especially <person> , my cousin .
my legacy .
your parents would be crushed to think you weren ' t happy with it .
then i ' ll have to kill you .
then kill me .
he ' s a softy . got him wrapped around my finger .
you think so .
motherfucker -- you better meet me ! that cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked ! i got the knife . i got ainge- <person> . <person> .

she - she can have my witch remover .
yeah ! gold ! how much ?
how the hell should i know how much ?
i didn ' t know sir .
it ' s your job to know . if something goes wrong up there , the other eighteen people aboard can ' t be wondering if he ' s gon na do his job or not . <continued_utterance> swing up , son .

yeah . here , i ' ll give you an example . <continued_utterance> <person> never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it . and with <person> , as i said , the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety . when he was really flipping out , in other words .
<person> was catholic ?
absolutely not . my teeth are perfect . <person> ' t ask me how i knew this thing was in my mouth .
it probably wasn ' t until you ordered the special .

i ' ve been a cop for a while , <person> . it ' s hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . and then there ' s the love angle . i mean do you and <person> really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ? <continued_utterance> am i right , did <person> sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking <person> ? that ' s murder , <person> .

you don ' t know what the hell you ' re talking about . you ' re a cocky seventeen year-old and you don ' t have a clue what the stakes are . you don ' t know the value of the life you ' ve yet to throw away . and neither does she .
how are we going to rescue anybody ?

the point of what ?
i don ' t think you ' re going to do that .
you don ' t ? listen to this woman in a man ' s world , a very violent world .
she needs to be changed .
i changed her already !
you ' re wrong about that . i ' m heading out that door right now . she heads towards the front door . just then the door blows in .
she had nothing to do with the tower jump . she ' s nobody . i just met her last night . tell them . i hardly know you .

bottle of water , white as snow .
<person> says her clothes should be washed by hand .
i know . you ' re one of the art works that go with the apartment . pretty creative . <person> ' t look anything like the place my son bought a few months age .
<person> , i hope you ' ll come here often , and under less formal circumstances .
i ' m no expert , but it seems to me that the `pursuit of a person ' s mythic destiny ' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do .
i ' m stuck . <person> . my life ' s a plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker with a tight pin position on a green with a stimp meter reading of thirteen . i need help . i need advice . i need counsel . i need a shrink .
no it ' s not .
no -- i know it ' s not . but it ' s kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we ' d be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state . and that means i don ' t want anybody running out at <number> : <number> or <number> : <number> , or whenever the bus happens to come in that day . now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school ? does your husband work in the area ? do you --
what do you think ? guess .
i felt . pain . that she ' d been hurt by someone . this is great . i ' m trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my --
yup .
<person> ?
you weren ' t trying to make threes . you were trying to avoid making thirteen .
i was hungover !
i have to give this baby to some- body .
i ' m somebody . lem me out and i ' ll take care of your baby .
easy now . that mare ' s in season .
oh . now she ' s starting . how do they know ?

an army of rebels and traitors .
where is <person> ?

yeah . <person> ' ll make me leave school if i screw up the play .
why lie about everything else , then ?
you know what it ' s like , <person> , to know you ' ll never be good ? not good like you . you got good all fucked around . i mean a stand up guy . i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything ' cause i was a cripple . <person> , i wasn ' t
<person> . you ' re under arrest !
you idiot . i lost the key for those cuffs .
no ! he was crazy . i didn ' t-he looked -- <number> thought --
<person> , okay . take it easy . <person> ' t freak out on me .
why don ' t you nap before dinner ?
yes , dear .
verbal , i know you know something . i know you ' re not telling us everything .
i told the d . a . everything i know .

oh , <person> . i hate this guy .
of a fight he can ' t win out here .
it ' s his father sir . he ' s suffocating him . we ' ve all seen it . <continued_utterance> i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn ' t even know who his own kid is . what right did then have to show up here ?
what the hell ' s a freeway ?
a freeway , mr . <person> , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l . a . to <person> . <person> to <person> . <person> to <person> . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l . a . <person> to another .
you found god at the smorgasbord ?
yeah .
<person> , it ' s <person> .
oh , hey .
i-i don ' t have the keys .
they ' re in the ignition , silly . <continued_utterance> you do know how to drive ?
<person> , <person> , i ' m sorry about ail this . i
why did you come here , <person> ?
i ' m told . we will move later when we find where the horses are needed most .
yes , sir . perhaps i can keep my brother here with me , he ' s also very good with horses .
what do we do ?
we can ' t stay here . even if that wasn ' t an iraqi soldier it ' s only a matter of time before some show up . get all the water you can carry , and we ' ll head out on foot .
the hell i am .
yes you are . my stuff stinks . i know it . you said so yourself .
not yet .
well , how are you going to fix it ?
you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen .
thanks .

i ' ll call you . in two hours .
how old is he ?
four . you ' re great with these kids .
<person> . he ' s been aimin ' that <person> through knotholes for years . i saw these , i knew he ' d finally struck gold . i can ' t decide which came out better , that little straw kelly ' s got up her nose , or that vibrator you ' ve got up her ass . what do you think , mr . <person> ?
i think there ' s some things you do , you don ' t want to see yourself doing them .
<person> , <person> .
i know one thing he said . it was when . when he took himself out and was standing up . he said , `` don ' t worry , i didn ' t come . `` i can ' t forget that . he said , `` no little girl can ever make me come . ``
take what out ? i ' m not taking anything out .
wait a minute , i don ' t get it ! we take the basket and the milk , that ' s all . we ain ' t gon na take the . what ' s inside .
it wasn ' t the gold . it was the claymore mine . the gold ' s in my pack .
when did you make the switch ?
i wouldn ' t go that far .
always quit on a good shot . we ' ll call that lesson number one .
you ' re getting warmer .
trees ?
there will simply be duplicate coverage .
<person> ' s just hope we don ' t have twins .

oh , it ' s being published in january . are you going to be in business in january ? i ' m so worried .
i ' ve got a thousand days . a thousand days sober today .
well , that ' s great , <person> . but it doesn ' t change anything .

you never know when sedatives will come in handy .
how long will it last ?
i don ' t know . this time is different . we were unprepared .
right .
i ' ll be in my trailer if you need me .
around here ? why would they ?
well , i ' m supposed monitor these seismographs . you know , they measure vibrations .
ya , but you can ' t do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i ' m not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
all the people working with us are really doing it ' cause they hate to see suffering .
just before we caught <person> . i had a dream that i was being chased . and i was running with other people . old- fashion indian people . i got shot in the back . <person> .
where was this ?
you know , <person> , a lot of people come to see me with all kinds of problems . drugs , alcohol , marital problems , sexual problems , health problems --
great job you got .
how can this be ?
the developing organism is using his life energy , digesting bone and tissue . we ' ve just slowed the process .
no , i came on my own .
<person> ' s go inside and we can call them to pick you up .
he ' s quiet .
he ' s weird .
a necessity for a child in a household with prying christian parents .

you were spying on me , weren ' t you ? you probably rented those children .
why would i spy on you ?
do you know where she is ?
no . but i know someone who might have an answer . who better .
no . we got in a fight because he ' s an asshole .
really ?
<person> ?
there ' s got to be some new variable . or an equipment malfunction .
<person> baby , its do-able . meet you at the wyatt club . <number> pm <person> thursday . indochina . then we ' ll kamikaze down to <person> ' s , chase a little cotton underwear -- i know this <number> year old bimbo , man . you can take it to the bank .

yeah . <person> . you oughta know , you bet her for me .
of course .
it didn ' t look like you were all that upset with the attention .
<person> thing you ' re not a cop .
you can ' t --
just , just a little coffee ?
<person> ' t found a mine for half a mile , or more .
that don ' t mean nothing . iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we ' re in the clear .
<person> , but he was with <person> at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with <person> and then with <person> . and since i stole <person> away from him . are you following this ?
i ' m not .
no , not right now .
every time i listen to <person> , i always remember when i used to work in atlantic city back in the late <number> ' s . you know , a busboy job . <person> used to play at the <number> <person> , and we used to take our dates and say , ' hey , you wan na go and hear <person> ? ' then we ' d just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music . i think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown .
hit the road , bub .
<person> .

something book of the dead .
you were supposed to stick to the plan . you were supposed to come with us . <person> needed you . i needed you . you were my big brother and you bailed on me . <continued_utterance> hey , i ' m glad you stayed and everything worked out for you , brendan . <person> , you leave , you get the opposite . you leave , you get to bury people .
you ' re not the only one who suffered , <person> . i didn ' t even know she was sick . i never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother . you had no right to keep that from me ! that was not your decision to make !
it ' s a matter of great importance to me !
intuition , <person> -- remember ? i know you ' re eager to be my appren- tice , <person> . but today is the spring festival .

<person> thinking maybe ?
you think i ' m pushy now , wait ' til i get you on the stand .
well , maybe you better do that , then . you know you guys are all the same . you don ' t care who gets hurt . you ' re a bunch of whores . you ' d do anything for a dollar . you got no loyalty . no nothing . you ' re a bunch of whores .
there ' s a waiter blocking , i can ' t see her face . he ' s serving her a cup of tea and she ' s putting in three spoonfuls of sugar --

and then what , <person> ? we ' d be back to where we were five years ago . you ' re talking like a teenager .
maybe i
you won ' t .
who ?
<person> .
<person> . yes . how are you today ?
<person> at him . we ought to just leave him behind . <continued_utterance> like he said : people get lost in wars all the time . and out here ? out here there are eight million ways to die .
<person> , so he was riding you . get over it . wes smiles a little smile .
it started out for <person> .
it just started out as a sock .
do me a favor , nance .
what .
i don ' t care what the damn pioneers ate . you just keep that shit away from me , now i mean it . <continued_utterance> and i don ' t want any more <person> , either . it ' s burning a hole in my stomach .

well you know , i think we really should get divorced .
wes , we thought you were dead , and we thought we were next . hanging around to get killed wouldn ' t have done anyone any good .

oh , c ' mon -- i love him ! only , i ' d like to see you alone for once , that ' s all .
he ' s extremely talented -- in fact , i hate to tell you this , but i think he and his group are gon na win the competition .

<person> to me , <person> ! i want you to go across the new corn to <person> ' . run as fast as you can . and stay there !
no .
<person> -
how far off the back foot ?
' bout three balls .
everything , but everything .
oh , <person> .
i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
yes .
thank you .
just watch . <continued_utterance> inhale the smoke and hold it .
what is this , like freebase ?
we can ' t let you --
boys -- <continued_utterance> put it all on <person> .
it ' s <person> ' s , the day manager ' s . he ' s gettin ' a divorce , so his wife ' s gettin ' this place , so he ' s just lettin ' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys .
i ' ve never had the chance to go out of town without <person> .
<person> and <person> don ' t get along .
that ' s puttin ' it mildly .
it doesn ' t sound like fun to me . you take the stuff you ' ve got here in the house , you take it someplace to eat it . it ' s just as much fun eating in front of the tv , and we do that together , don ' t we ? no ants and no bees . much more comfortable .
it ' s not the same thing .
really ?
yeah , really , <person> .
my driving range back .
<person> , i ' m not as dumb as my hair makes me look .
you sure you ' re not trying to keep me here ? <continued_utterance> why wouldn ' t i ?
i thought you were in a hurry .
well , i counseled you , you did exactly what i said , and i just . poured cold water over your effort . i didn ' t get it . i ' m a terrible shrink , probably . i should ' ve never got out of real estate -- actually i should never have left <person> for that cowboy in armarillo -- have you ever been to amarillo ?
a cowboy ?
<person> , okay . take it easy . <person> ' t freak out on me .
do you have a mirror ? it ' s the best way to see if someone ' s breathing .
just this minute . i ' m <person> , these ' re my brothers-
<person> . <person> , right ?
. <person> ' t <person> just move his headquarters to <person> ?
contrary to what you may believe , <number> , the world is not filled with mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes , stock them with big-breasted women , and threaten the world with nuclear annihilation . bond reacts to the comeuppance . she continues : m the case is closed . the italian authorities ruled the girl a suicide . we had enough trouble keeping your name out of the media . for everyone ' s sake - your job is to find the gold . not settle some personal score with <person> .
<person> .
<person> ! <person> , step up ! up !
we can ' t stop . i ' ve been noticing some new . glitches . i ' m not sure what they mean . i ' m not sure the game is ok .
<person> , to be honest , i find your game very confusing . i ' m not sure i want to go back in there , because i ' m not convinced i ' m going to keep coming out . do you really like that feeling ?
how much ?
a lot .
you ' re a genius of bad timing . i ' m going back to the party . <continued_utterance> this is a great shot .
thanks .
what if it never happens ? what if
<person> ; s <person> talking .
laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , <person> had only one successful business .
<person> ' t you have some good news ? isn ' t there something positive you could say . <continued_utterance> sometimes i wonder what i ' ll do if <person> doesn ' t get out . i ' m not very adept at being on my own . i ' ve always had a man in my life . always .
mad like a dog in heat , i bet you were . i can tell you got a temper on you . <person> gives a little laugh . <continued_utterance> bet you just wanted to snap her neck right then , didn ' t you ? bet you just wanted to kill her . <continued_utterance> would you ?
would i what ?
<person> ' t you want to know . ? i bet it ' s burning a hole in your brain just now ?
let it go , baby . it ' s the past . i got a past .
whatever kind they wanted her to be . <continued_utterance> i ' m telling you what i was told by my uncle . and he should know . he ran half a dozen men ' s clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt .
<person> ' t you say your mom went to catholic school ?
from citizen high to citizen low .
i don ' t care .
go .
go ?
so what firm you with , pal ?
<person> , <person> .
yes .
you should come to our temple .
why what ?
why did you forget the tent check ?
you ' re really twisted , <person> . you ' re incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there ' s a poverty that every last dollar in the world won ' t fill .
ooh ooh , tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package . does this mean you ' re ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ? because , <person> , if you ' re through with me , you ' re through with everything i ' m a part of .
<person> told me about that thing at cao ben ?
what ?
a piece . only a piece .
is it enough ?
no , <person> . it ' s fine . eat up . <person> . <person> looks at <person> and shakes her head `` no '' .
<person> . <person>m . this sure is good . <person> . <person>m . <person>m .
he used your exact words .
you knew . you knew all the time , that he was out there , that he was coming for me , and you lied . you used me , you used me as bait . you made love to me -- what , to pass the time as you waited for him to strike ? he has no answer . he can ' t deny what she says . <continued_utterance> he ' s struck again . five men are dead at the pipeline .
well , many reasons , actually .
tell me one ?
<person> .
what are you doing here ?
<person> , you ' re really-
cards in spades . i ' m in love with <person> second of her life . <person> , i ' ll probably love her when i ' m dust .
he came to see you ?
he ' s over at the house . we ' re doing a little training at <person> ' s . remember <person> ' s ? it ain ' t <person> ' s anymore .
ask me no questions , i ' ll tell you no lies .
<person> answer . <person> goes double for me .
<person> , <person> skipped school . have you talked to her ?
no .
but then you ' ve been so much better .
<person> , this isn ' t about you . this is something that ' s happening to me . it ' s not to get even . and it ' s not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not .
it ' s just the first wave . you can be part of the second wave . ok , <person> . put your arms up . i have to scan you . metal and heavy synthetics can ' t come in .
a weapons check ?
good-looking ?
i just told you,
this virus -- it .
<person> --
do not dishonor my father ' s name with your lies .
your father is a murderer and a thief . he stole what was ours , and left our world in ruins . we have the right to reclaim the casket .
hey , what are you , my nanny ?
<person> to me . <person> to me . listen to me , frank , ' cause i ' m done fuckin ' with you . i can ' t do it any more . <person> around you : you think that you ' re going to change ? what ' s going to change it ? you think it ' s going to be different next month ? it ' s going to be the same . and i have to stop . this is it . i got you a good case , it ' s a moneymaker . you do it right and it will take care of you . but i ' m through . i ' m sorry , frank , this is the end . <person> is too short , and i ' m too old . <person> walks out of the office . slams the door . <person> .
i don ' t give a fuck ! i didn ' t tell you to do it ! you can ' t just do unauthorized work .
well , now , you just know all there is about bein ' a mechanic , don ' t you ? <person> ' t you read the sign .
you loaded these songs . you don ' t need to be so impressed with yourself .
i know i don ' t have to be .
whose fire !
no ! help ! stop !
sure . but your fee . considering you ' re way over budget , should be negotiable .
<person> ' s get things straight , <person> . i ' m not going to take a cut . i worked hard and you can ' t decorate a room in new york for less than $ <number> , <number> .
no .
what then ? how do you explain-
we ' ll leave him a note . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m not defending <person> ' s recent behavior in any way , so please don ' t take this personally . however irrational the reasons , <person> is so upset with you that i think it would be best if you weren ' t around when he comes back .
really ?
i ' m not . and i ' m not doing anything , because there ' s nothing down here .
get up and dig .
i haven ' t got all night to wait here while you eat free food ! you ' ve got your warrant , arrest those girls !
now , we agreed to let them finish their show first .
<person> , are you crazy ? they ' re out gunning for us ! what the hell ' re you doin ' ?
what ' s it look like ? they want a piece of me they can come and get it , i ' m not crawlin ' into my hole .
yes , <person> .
even if i end up going to jail . <person> smiles his crooked grin . <person> ' re still the best teacher i ever had .
have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling .
i ' m busy .
the stone age .
the post-vegas man .
come on , it ' s our only senior prom .
deaf ears , mr . <person> . i answer to a higher power .
-junior ' s already here-
-<person> was my snitch , so it ' s my scene .
<person> down . sit down . are you hungry ?
not really .
what are you talking about ?
<person> ' t sweet lip me .
he should be caring . that is not too much to ask .
ya , but you can ' t do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i ' m not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
for what ?
the benefit of the doubt . <continued_utterance> it ' s never taken this long before .
the papers are going to eat you alive . even if you beat it , you ' ll never get another commission . they want someone to be accountable .
i am accountable .
<person> appreciates <person> ' s political skills . and the addition of a professional ball-club to our fare city fulfills his own personal mandate of a cleaner , brighter , la .
sounds boring .
flew . told my wife i was going to a promise keepers convention . ted gives him a look . dom i hate to ruin your day , ted , but i have some bad news for you .
<person> .
wait a minute . you ' re telling me that i didn ' t win the last race ?
you won , wing . you won , it ' s just that you ' re not getting any money . it was a fluke . i swear , i don ' t know how it could have happened . a ten-year-old couldn ' t have made the mistake i made . i don ' t know , i swear .
yes , it is . <person> , i think it worked .
it totally worked . they opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade .
oh , that sucks more . he ' s the plumber . i called him to look at that piece of crap of boiler . <person>man points to an ancient hot water boiler .
why ?
bernice <person> has tried to commit suicide . <continued_utterance> she swallowed a number of sleeping pills , and is now in a coma .
the poor girl .
welcome to <person> . have a look at our proposal . please follow me .
you can wait out here .
uh huh .
what ' s it about ?
you seen anything of a man on horseback leading a black stallion ? <continued_utterance> well you must ' ve seen somethin ' , the trail runs right by your waterhole . oh , i see . so it must ' ve been a cowboy , right ? really got you <person> treed , don ' t they ?
look , <person> , it ' s fine for you boomers to court trouble , you ' re just passin ' through . <person> got ta live here . best i can do ' s point you up to the cut . that ' s their roost .
relieved ?
i had just been left by <person> . i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason , it made me feel better that your life wasn ' t as perfect as it seemed . <continued_utterance> by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , <person> called from the hospital and it was too late .
i ' m no stranger to the notion of philanthropy . <person> has long been one of my idols .
what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in `` heaven ? ''
evening , <person> .
what do you have ?
i ' m on it .
can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight ? they ' re exhausted .
i suppose the smaller caliber pistols would have to fire baby teeth . the tooth fairy could go i into the arms business .
that guy really came there tonight just to kill you .
i ' m calling the ambulance .
just wait a second . wait one second . <person> . what are you doing ?
no , thanks , i ' m nervous enough .
i guess it ' s time to hit the road .
i know who you are . <person> out of your neighborhood , aren ' t you ?
<person> , i had to go slummin ' . <person> , a friend of mine ' s bein ' framed .
i don ' t recall asking you for advice . women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie --
actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot --
leland leave her alone . she doesn ' t like that . stop it .
how do you know what she doesn ' t like ?
oh , baby , what an idea . id always be happy to see you , no matter what .
i know , peanut . but it wasn't all like you were so unhappy i was there , just you were upset . my bein there was upsettin to you . you had some kids there , little kids , and i guess youd got married and your husband was comin home any minute .
i heard what you did . thank you .
she great or what ?
<person> , now who is that ?
one lousy letter eighteen months ago . i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way .
he mourns for his brother . and he misses her . the mortal .

he implied it .
well you ' re a writer , and a lot of writers are gay . <person> at truman capote .
<person> ' s just eat .

how do you know that ?
i do apologize , sir . i heard a noise .

i saw their car last night in the parking lot at base . so they didn ' t leave , `` just before dusk . ``
well , i was down at base this morning . car ' s gone now .
i may be the outlaw , but you ' re the one stealin ' my heart .
and smooth , boy , you are smooth . <continued_utterance> you ' re kinda the best thing that ' s happened to me in a long time .
not so well . i have been afflicted with some kind of chronic fatigue .
perhaps you are home sick . you do sound rather blue .

i don ' t know ! i just want to get married .
all of it .
it ' s not .
the next right . ?
turn .
what is that ?
it ' s from the court .
your career is one i ' d worry about . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry -
no , no . you ' re more right then you even know . i used to be one of those guys who was just
we are a stunning couple . mr . president , you own one fifth of all the land in nicaragua , you own the shipping port , the national airlines , the mercedes dealership .
i am on a salt free diet .

undersheriff <person> and i have talked on the phone . <person> work .

i just drove in this morning .
i ' ll see .
i think that might be good .
who did you get it from ?
i am just a middle man . i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner .
hamlet . what ' s <person> got to do with <person> <number> . <number> ?
he ' s part of the mix . <person> <number> . <number> is a composite .
what the fuck you talkin ' about ?

i hear <person> is great this time of year .
i ' ll be with you the whole month . try your baby steps .
these are real , live women ?
we don ' t generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there ' s a market for it .
<person> .
get out of my way .
they ' re merely tools to disseminate information .
or disinformation . if you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? maybe one degree a minute ?
is that why you called me . just to tell me that ?
no . i also wanted to say that i ' ll do whatever you think is best for <person> . i promise .
<person> , but you did promise .
sue me . <person> me to court . oh , <person> , i know you ' re disappointed , but .
not yet .
are you going to ?
it ' s gon na cost extra .
i will pay .
what happens to you ? i ' m not leaving without you .
i ' ll be evacuated with the president .
. fifty thousand dollars ?
i don ' t want to leave her . <person> . the , the . and <person> , he said that it was <person> ' s will .
you told me so . maybe you ' d get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place .
and what makes you so tough ?
-- i thought -- maybe you could sell your half of the house to me , and i could pay you whatever it is over a certain amount of time , and that way --
no , you know what ? i ' ll just go .
hi .
remember me , from the bookstore ?
if it ' s a love song , don ' t get too close .

i don ' t want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell .
i ' m almost finished . i ' m about to come to the punch line .
well , she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that i could tell . what you make of that ?
<person> , we bein strangers here and all , this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin .
mom , i ' m sorry ! all i wanted to do was talk . i ' ll go .

this afternoon . our boats practically kissed in the harbor . <person> .
<person> .
no , <person> . it ' s true . you work for e . i . o . so do i .
but why all of this ?
now , as you know , the difficulty in explaining the fourth dimension is that it can not be seen or felt - it must be thought of .
if you don ' t mind , <person> , would you refresh me on the first three dimensions .
what ' s goosed ?
what is her disposition ?
red dress , strappy shoes ?
that ' s right ! <continued_utterance> i think she ' s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
i don ' t know how .
<person> away .
<person> called . they're stayin another week .
stayin a few extra days in the big n . o . , huh ? this you ?
all stirred . remember how <person> always used to find a way to keep our morale up . without telling us ? it ' s about time we returned the favor . <person> ' s surprise him with a real big bang-up reunion .
now you ' re talking ! how do we spread the word ?
<person> deal . <continued_utterance> is everything okay ?
great . <person> . <person> .
i couldn ' t catch my breath . that ' s not a metaphor , that ' s . and i panicked . i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there . i tried to leave him . went to my mother ' s in boston . he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home . <person> is mesmerized . <continued_utterance> you must think i ' m pathetic .
no . no , i don ' t .
work ' s been slow for me since the cartoons went to color . but i still got it , <person> . ' boop boop be-doop ' .
<person> , you still got it , <person> . who ' s mr . jocularity ?

you are going after mayor <person> .
<person> ' s just say i ' m sending a very clear message to his reelection rally .
<person> . i will , too .
and steal <person> ' s fishin ' stuff .
<person> .
that ' s a reasonable question for a reporter to ask , isn ' t it ? ! i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this is the way it ' s going to be . i ' ll make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there . i ' m gon na show up to work at rockefeller center every morning and they ' re gon na hand me the news with my coffee and toast . i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this war down here belongs to you guys , okay ? i ' m on tomorrow ' s plane .
you promise you ' ll finish school ?
i ' ll make you very proud .
he was large ? <continued_utterance> did you try to fight him ?
i . he had my wrists pinned behind me .
<person> ' t you have any tights to put on her legs ?
tights ? . well , it ' s pretty hot in here anyway .
<person> little ! ! you eat like an animal ! it couldn ' t have been very little .
i didn ' t have that much . doesn ' t anybody remember ?

<person> look like you . <continued_utterance> the cobras waitin to strike , chica .
that guy <person> came around this afternoon . asked me if there was a contract out on im .
i ' d work backstage or something ?
or something . they ' re doing a play for the holidays .
oh , i know . <person> deal you have . <person> immunity .
well i do have the weapons charge . i ' m looking at six whole months hard time .
we missed you . we wanted to check on you .
i don ' t need you spying on me .
what do you do about it ? i mean , how do you cope ?
well . the way i figure it , if it weren ' t called `` death '' , it wouldn ' t be so bad . i mean what if it were called `` dink '' ?
i ' m gon na walk back to the gas station for help . you ' ve got the heater and the radio , so you should be all right here . though i really think you should consider coming with me .
i bet you do .
i can see that .
i didn ' t ask for an extra bed . <continued_utterance> are you all right with the sofa ? if you like , i can have them bring one up ?
no way . no way .
<person> . now i ' m going to slap you .
<person> , the reason i came into your store is that i was spending the day with <person> and <person> . i like to buy them a present when i see them because i ' m one of those guys who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relatives . there was only one place to buy children ' s books in the neighborhood -- although that will not always be the case , and it was yours , and it is a charming little bookstore . you probably sell $ <number> , <number> worth of book a year --
how do you know that ?
well , yeah . i ' ll improve .
i got no money to pay for you .
mr . <person> , you disappoint me . first you break our school board rules . then you break the law .
what law , <person> ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?
it ain ' t broke .
goddamn it ! i ' m . you ' re lucky i don ' t sue you . jake get goin ' <person> . <continued_utterance> you people are crazy !
i can get <number> <person> here in about <number> minutes . they ' re on maneuvers out of <person> .
<person> ' em . i ' ll brief them on the way in .
i want to trust you .
<person> enough .
<person> . i ' m darned if i can figure out why .
i thought you were an expert on women . come on , <person> !
<person> ' s give <person> a call to see if he is coming or not . <person> likes to exaggerate , keep you waiting all night .
why don ' t you wait ?
wait a minute . that reminds me . what precisely is the goal of the game we ' re playing now ? i mean , the rules , the objective . <person> ' s ever really said anything about what you have to do in existenz .
the beauty of existenz is that it changes every time you play it . it adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it . the result is that you have to play the game to find out why you ' re playing the game .
well , maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids . i ' m sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children .
<person> , i could too . but . i don ' t know why i ' m even asking you this . it ' s just . we can ' t place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie . i don ' t know . i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable . if just one person would say .
i don ' t have his number .
they can patch you in through the switchboard . <continued_utterance> hey ! we don ' t have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command . the order came direct from general mcaddie . call him . we ' ll conduct our business while you confirm authorization .
<person> !
my name is mister <person> . - <person> ' t you hear the air raid siren ?
you and <person> move the bodies and bury boyd with them . in fact , put <person> in the ground too .
what ?
they ' ll search the pack . <continued_utterance> they ' ll find the gold .
we ' re lost , you understand that ? we ' ve got no navicom , and no means to find a way back . so right now i don ' t give a damn about the gold because if we don ' t get off this desert , and out of iraqi all it ' s going to be good for is buying us tombstones .
who the hell are you ?
i ' m her husband . bobby husband . ? <continued_utterance> now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i ' ll break you in half .
about five minutes ago .
every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around .
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago .
what ' s a toby ?
we ' re of a common bloodline boy-o .
where ' d you get that haul ?
nothing . he asked for directions . <continued_utterance> we got ta get outta sight -- half the fucking army ' s looking for me .
they ' re not looking for me . <continued_utterance> let me have the film . . if i can ' t get to the hotel i ' ll come back here .
no , c ' mon !
oh . <person> . well . just a couple things . one -- there ' s only two kinds of beer available -- <person> and <person> . <person> ' s better . and two -- if you see <person> hanging around the hotel bar -- hot , hot , hot -- but don ' t touch . she belongs to tacho , and if anybody gets caught with her then el presidente has promised to personally cut off the guy ' s .
<person> is dead . <person> . <person> isn ' t quite sure he understood .
in the picture he ' s dead ?
not from in here .
this is a full pardon . it authorizes your immediate release .
still there . how ' s yours ?
i guess you took my mind off it .
why didn ' t you just tell her the truth ?
i don ' t know . i guess . it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on <person> wages . the girls all seem moved by this .
say no more , i ' m right behind you . <continued_utterance> and you understand what ' s happening , do you not , <person> ? that you must lay so very nice and still . there ' s a lad , you ' re a remarkable horse , you are , helping us help you . there ' s a lad . there ' s a remarkable lad . <continued_utterance> so how ' s things in yonder trench ?
delightful . we read , we knit sweaters , and we train our rats to perform circus tricks .
i ' d like an apartment .
<person> for a drink ?
<person> ! <person> for death !
<person> ' t sweat it , <person> . i ' ll handle it . we just have to disappear for a while . and right now , we have to stop .
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
i had something a little different in mind . instead of just playing <person> with <person> , why don ' t you get him to show you what he ' s been working on after hours ?
i don ' t like it .
you do too , so stop drawing and eat .
mr . <person> is one of his operatives .
that is my permiso .
well , when you figure it out , wake me up .
just what the hell is wrong with you ?
yes .
i ' m on a special phone , may i speak freely ?
i know i am . can you meet me ?
um , ok .
i know where he ' s coming from . the only thing i really don ' t get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
<person> ' t even start . i ' ll be honest , i don ' t trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?

what ' s he talking about ? the man got the job for twenty-four hundred dollars , and that ' s what it costs in aluminum siding .

you crashed my file ?
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones . <continued_utterance> it ' s a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others . the question is , which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control ?
this is getting you pumped up , isn ' t it ? this is like the world series to you .
you ' ve been back to dallas ?
yes .
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ?
i don ' t get the distinction .

he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster . he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster . <continued_utterance> he says there ' s something wrong with <person> -- he ' s crazy , he says you stopped the inipi ceremony last night . ? <continued_utterance> but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you .
he knows me ?
but you would have something to gain by killing <person> . and stopping his pipeline .
poor <person> . the cold war is over . what have you got left ? economic espionage . <person> in the boardroom . so dull .
i already made you two tapes .
<person> , you have to deal with _all_ of this .

of course , i ' m always happy . unless i ' m bored . that blonde <person> , is that your wife ?
he ' s always got it bad as long as i ' m running in the other direction . <person> ' t be fooled , he ' s no different than any other guy . he knows how to chase and that ' s it . once he ' s caught you , he don ' t know what to do . so he runs away .
i heard that .
forget it , man . it ' s not worth it .
she ' s got us . now , listen , the plan is : we have done our last job in perfection .
there ' s more .
just stop .
they don ' t seem to have a problem with it either . mcmanus nobody runs .
this ain ' t my boy we ' re burying . i don ' t owe anybody .
they ' re screaming for starbursts .

another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?
you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .
how would it be if she keeps him tied up ? he ' s really gentle -- with gentle people , that is .
well , that ' s for the sheriff to decide . here ' s his order allowing me to take him .

you think you ' re working with chimps here ?
what ' s your point ?
you want to know what you are doing here ? ! you are love pumping . you are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies . you are walking the walk . this is it fisher , the real stuff . you love this woman . <person> is second to nothing . i love you . i love <person> . i love <person> . this car is full of love , and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- supersedes love , man . nothing . we will do what it takes . whatever it takes . <continued_utterance> <person> does not lose .
<person> . i just want to say we ' re voting for you in the election . digiacomo both of you ? <continued_utterance> of course . digiacomo grazie , grazie . <person> . she leaves . he turns back <person> : digiacomo so . you ' ll signal us if you find the uranium -
and you ' ll wait until after the press conference - and everyone is gone - before you board the boat and arrest him . digiacomo perfecto . then we turn him over to you , and the english government puts him on a military transport back to london . <person> nods , looks over at the sea dolphin ii . digiacomo do not worry , my friend . i only want what is best . for both of us . <person> stands to leave . digiacomo smiles after <number> - as if he ' s

you fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you , they arrange it .
i rather don ' t like your tone .
you sit back down .
what ' s wrong with <person> ?
how should i know ? <continued_utterance> i wonder how that .
i wanted to look you in the eye before i kill you .
that ' s what i figured . <continued_utterance> <person> there , going to help ? <continued_utterance> scene <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> <person> is puzzled .

<person> after this . test ?

jbj . <person> . i ' m a fan . you got a problem with that ?
no i do not .
no , but it ' s wonderful for threatening with .
oh --
thanks .
i ' ve heard the light in <person> ' s even better .
halt ! und aussteigen !
my name is <person> - this is my land . why are you here ?
by all means .
<person> to be a dog in the service of a great master , than a beef- witted moron so dazzled by the throne that he does not see the true nature of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it . which is to say , that most muddy-brained of all men . a musketeer .
why not ?
you can ' t ask advice about the woman you ' re trying to hose from the woman you ' re trying to hose !
i guess .
they did do one great thing . they gave us our boy .
yes sir .
north , north-east .
no .
nevertheless , i ' d like to see you in my office monday morning . as the line goes dead , grady stares at the phone,
<person> . five years from now .
i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i ' m about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss <person> conroy of xenia , ohio .
<person> . sure . ok . you ' re right .
so are we still friends ?
i don ' t want to talk about it . <person> ' s get to work . <continued_utterance> there must be something to do . there ' s always something to do .
he stood her up .
tibetan . it ' s not a how-to manual . it ' s an <number> th century buddhist guide on death and dying .
god . why is this happening to us ?
my work keeps me young .
<person> part , getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities ?
they ' ll catch up eventually .
my father used to hunt in a forest like this . he promised to take me on my tenth birthday . i don ' t know why he picked that year . something about a boy becoming a man . i ' d lay in bed at night and imagine it , just the two of us . but he died before i could go with him .
even the canned stuff ?
leave it !
we know , but our man says no way on the dope . this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next ' day . they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
what was the money for ?
where ' s <person> ? where ' d ya take her .
nowhere . i ' m trying to find her .
no , no , i ' m just .
why don ' t you get some rest ?
well , that ' s a relief . i ' ll leave you two alone . you can leave the tray outside your door when you ' re finished .
what is that you ' ve brought ?
i swear .
do you swear to preserve the peace ?
the big dog ' ll eat ?
the big dog ' ll hunt , that ' s for sure .
nothing .
what about this ?
he ' s a strong one , <person> . <person> at the way he holds his head !
how the hell are we gon na pull anything with that ? ted - you have to take him back . you have to take him back right now now .
existenz is a lot more than a game .
<person> , right , it ' s a game system .
perhaps we could be patient for just a moment or two longer ?
what did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something black and white and red in a blender ? no more patients . <continued_utterance> are you familiar with `` heaven ? ''
it ' s hard to explain .
get in .
so whaddaya say pal , wan na play some doubles at piping ? meet the membership ? i got a little blonde named <person> , about nineteen , avec cafe au lait boobs . she ' s mine but she ' s got a cousin who has great muffins .
. sounds dubious <person> , but <person> any day .
but you know , really , don ' t you ? you don ' t have to guess . i mean , it ' s your game , your little universe .
i don ' t know . you have to understand that , to understand what we ' ve really created with existenz .
you know , <person> , i ' m not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
how much is a shave and a haircut , <person> ?
<person> -- give me a break ! ! !
what ' s the matter with you ?
-- that destroys --
-- everything we hold dear . but we ' ll seduce them with our square footage and our deep armchairs and our amazingly swift checkout lines and our discounts and our .
they ' re cancelling all leaves , all passes . no more drills . we stand at full ready starting --
what ' s your point , <person> ? you have a point ?
ha ha ! ! to infinity and <person> ! ! <continued_utterance> uh , <person> ? ! we missed the truck !
we ' re not aiming for the truck !
there are so many to choose from . is it the one about my alleged alliance with <person> ? let ' s see if i remember it correctly . while the english attack from without , i ' ll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of france myself . that rumor , <person> ?
it does seem rather farfetched .
why not ? you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid , weren ' t you ? <continued_utterance> <person> , do what you want . but keep the screws on him . he ' s a wild card . that could be either good or bad .
so the odds are up to fifty-fifty ? i can deal with that .
<person> , i know i ' ve been out of touch .
i was a little worried . i mean --
i ' m throwing myself to the wolves .
you ' ve faced worse . and if they bite , you can come back here .
and what do you think you might have said ?
i think i might ' ve said i was in love with you . <person> ' s face remains . unchanged . grady he told you .
why , honey ?
case daddy dont like me . what if he dont like that i dont got his color hair .
no .
i am .
no .
did you get up from your seat ?
in the meantime , we ' ll be watching your line . <person> , <person> ?
<person> .

i don ' t know what the cops have told you , but let me assure you - <person> gianni is alive alive alive .

like the plague .
a mistake ?
a promise .
when did you talk to <person> ?

we ' re here , <person> . just tell us what you need . come back .
they ' re tearing down the houses here ! we all got ta get outta here together ! now !
five-hundred-thousand martian dollars , that ' s .
not martian dollars , mr .
who was that ?
sylvia -- she wanted to know how <person> was doing .
no , you ' re not blind . you ' re just drinking <person> . and when you drink <person> , you start . in with that <person> , `` she shot . me down , '' gim me a cigarette , king of sad thing .
that . i do . gim me a cigarette .
you got a cigarette ? <continued_utterance> if you snap a picture of me , i get to set you on fire . <person> ?
it didn ' t look like you were all that upset with the attention .
i can ' t live there anymore .
with your mom ? did she do that to your eye ?
it ' s a slump . it ' s a slump , <person> .
maybe it ' s a slump , but like baseball , some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again .
no .
make a note : steal bethune ' s guest- list , then go door-to-door until you find her again .
looks like a diner .
<person> , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . i wake up drugged to find what ? you ' ve got a `` salesman '' over here reading a three week old newspaper . he ' s pulling a <number> with a `` trucker '' , who happens to be packing a cop issue handk <number> mm . i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how ' s that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i `` walked '' in ? and if that ' s true , why ' d they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money ? then i notice how beefy they both are . <person> , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . ergo they ain ' t strangers and this isn ' t what it seems . that ' s how i knew yo-yo wouldn ' t get a round off even if i gave him all day . why ? <continued_utterance> cuz there ' s nothing but blanks in these guns . and no offense , but their performances were terrible .
you ' ve faced worse . and if they bite , you can come back here .
i ' ll always come back here .
what ! this stupid obsess .
i think i ' ve been . i vaguely recall .
i hope that ' s true , but . it ' s not that . it ' s .

nobody calls me an idiot .
god damn it man . i think he broke my nose !
<person> .
that ' s right . that was his name . <continued_utterance> sometimes i wonder if you ' re really as dumb as you pretend to be . <continued_utterance> but you know what ? i ' d be keeping a clear mind right now if i were you . i ' d hate to see you come to a bad end . like <person> did .
so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?

<person> , just remember that you have something even the great allfather never had .
and what is that ?

the richest one percent of this country owns half the country ' s wealth : <number> trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do -- stock and real estate speculation . it ' s bullshit . <person> percent of the american people have little or no net worth . i create nothing ; i own . we make the rules , <person>dy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it . . you ' re not naive enough to think we ' re living in a democracy are you , <person>dy ? it ' s the free market . you ' re one of us now . take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . i got things to teach you .
you have to help me . i was kidnapped . my boyfriend came . and this man ' s chasing me . he ' s chasing me right now .

it ' s not bad .
you and <person> hit it off so well .
<person> , it is your business , but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy .
she ' s the only nurse who isn ' t testifying for the doctors .
what did he find ?
my baby here has now taken three major hits , one in the church , one in the gas station , and one on the operating table . the only way i can tell if everything ' s ok - the game ' s not been contaminated , the pod ' s not fucked - is to play existenz with somebody friendly . are you friendly , or are you not ?
you ' re telling me this thing will run off my body ' s energy ?
up to you . from now on you ' re completely on your own .
oh , really ?
<person>by <person> , just like the country .
<person> to red and <person> , <person>bys the most excitin item to hit big tuna since the <number> cyclone sheared the roof off the high school .

<person> , i ' m as worried as you are --
<person> up ! just shut up , you idiot ! !
<person> , this is no time to panic .
<person> , please . <person> ' t be late for the ten o ' clock with the board .

what did you tell him ?
not so simple .
you ' re god damn right it ' s not . you take that picture you ' ll take it for all the right reasons -- i understand .
what are you talking about ?
i really did think i was still in reality . at least , until now . beam me up , <person> !
were you a friend of father ' s ?
yes . yes . i ' ve been away .
is that what you think ?
you lead with your vanity . you talk when you should listen . unless these are the qualities of a democrat ?
<person> moon turned out to be in somebody else ' s house , as i recall .
just like <person> .
thank you . <person> , take me to headquarters immediately ! we ' ll have those men turned out on the double !
<person> , <person> . take the short cut .
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
they ' re ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it ' s only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy <person> . then we ' re gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
aw , come , come , come --
no , they won ' t - honestly .
i don ' t know .
but you ' re hopeful ?
you think the cops have our phone bugged ?
i don ' t think that ' s legal , is it ?

i hope you ' re right .
<person> : brian .
brian . hi . i ' m <person> -- i ' m the lending officer ?
whozat ?
whozat ?

maybe we shouldn ' t make it .
i didn ' t do it , <person> .
who are you protecting , then ?
sure .
<person> or skinny ?
what happened ?
he wasn ' t able to make it .
he ' s dead .
<person> looked pretty dead , himself . bullets don ' t kill these <person> .
remember our friend <person> ? well , i didn ' t know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother ' s apartment . turns out there is no diabetic mom . <person> said she ' s been dead for ten years .
and this adversely affects me how . ?
but i didn ' t tell her !
you know what ? <person> ' t even fuckin ' talk to me .
you know it and i know it .
what is wrong with us ? . we have everything .
<person> ' t we already have someone to do that for us ?
yeah . you .
your day will come . i never thought mine would , but it did . was all that stuff about <person> and <person> made up ?
i wish . did you really take a posture class ?
oh , <person> . call the police .
no .
but i ' m telling you , my father put away every penny he ever earned . they owned that house outright . why would he have a mortgage ?
my guess is because he let people pay him in beans and eggs or whatever they had , instead of money .
they ' re not my parents , <person> . my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much .
i understand .
go away . i am not talking to you .
i want you .

oh . <person> , <person> . would you pass the salt ?
nine-one-one ? oh , sure .
and just in case , i ' ve written the number of the children ' s <person> and <person> here , too .
you think that many people are going to .
i ' m certain of it . i ' m not giving away four hundred dollars for my health . i ' m a businessman , and i ' m a good businessman . this is good business for me . i ' m giving it away ' cos i believe in this house , believe that it will refer me to other jobs which means money in my pocket , which means money in your pocket .

you ' re kidding ?
your gluteus maximus is better than i hoped . it will serve you well .

<person> , we are young , yes ? is the world not our oyster ? beaucoup des filles . do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl ?

<person> , nobody make a move ! <person> walked away when you had the chance , dumb shit .
he never came .
he stood you up ?
i listen to crap ?
hurts me to be the one to tell you .
can ' t hurt . and i think it ' s important you find out what she wants .
are you humoring me ?
<person> not ! he heareth all !
please . getting past him should be simple enough now , since he seems to be letting <person> sneak by under his nose .
you say its straight ahead a mile ?
about . where <person> crosses over <person> . state <person> <number> .
<person> is startled by the noise .
uh . <person> ? was that you ?
that is none of your business .
come on , kiddo . i ' ve been there . i ' ve done it . i ' ve seen it . you can trust me . i ' ll understand .
got ta pee .
why didn ' t you go before , when we were outside ?
spying ? !
i can take care of myself .
of what ? what were you so afraid of ?
you ' re going to think i ' m crazy or something .
i don ' t drink coffee . <person> want ?
you don ' t want to go sit down somewhere ?
all i told them was the truth .
they ' re trying to divide us on this , <person> . we can ' t let them .
<person> , i guess you did .
<person> , i ' m sorry , <person> . it ' s just --
you have given them names ?
yes , sir .
i guess i ' ve got wander in my blood .
where you headed ?
no , but it don ' t matter anyway when you ' re lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i ' m telling <person> about this drifter , didn ' t have enough money to fix his car . and <person> happened to find his gun , and through maybe this drifter heard old <person> got some money stashed away , and figgered he might try to break in and steal it !
wait a minute . just listen to me .
not in here dad . please . later .
. it adds up <person> , <number> here , <number> there . your brother never . . well , i always said money is something you need in case you don ' t die tomorrow .
that ' s what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it ' s a cool car . want to take me for a ride ? <person> ' s kind of lonely this time of day .
how old are you ?
what does <person> ' s father look like ?
a short guy . heavy set . balding .
oh , honey , <person> . <person> ' t start with that again .
why not ?
where is the ring ?
someone else has it now .
then i will shoot .
be kind . and aim for my heart . <continued_utterance> i remember . everything .
i guess .
i ' m saying it ' s luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he ' s paid the dues , he ' s ready , does all the market research , picks his shot -- `` <person> . ``
you came here to give me my report card ?
i ' ve seen students with records like yours go to j . c . for a couple of years , then transfer to a good college . <continued_utterance> i ' d gladly write you a letter of recommendation .
i was hoping we could talk .
<person> ? about what ?
well you ' re a writer , and a lot of writers are gay . <person> at truman capote .
<person> , but he was successful .
that ' s -- <person> ' t threaten me , <person> : i ' m not threatening you . i -- it ' s just an area i think we should explore .
i ' m not thr -- you explore it . i ' m going back to work . <continued_utterance> oh , and i have to pick up rudy today because there ' s no one else to do it . but i ' ll find someone as soon as i have time .
until we ' re out of the mine field is how long .
<person> ' t found a mine for half a mile , or more .
good-day , <person> . i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .
you bastards ! believe me - you haven ' t heard the last of me !
and i love you too .
and love ' s a funny thing . sometimes i don ' t know if i want to love you . <continued_utterance> .
i don ' t think we have anything to talk about .
what about us ?
you tell them <person> .
it ' s simple . bad things happen sometimes . it wasn ' t <person> or <person> . it was all of us . everyone in this room . because we all knew the risks . you sent us . you paid our tuition , you allowed us to go . so to invent a reason for why this happened , to pin it on one person , well that won ' t change anything . it ' ll just make our experience meaningless . <continued_utterance> if you want to judge this man , judge him by his crew . judge him by alice and <person> . <person> and <person> and <person> . in one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us . this may sound crazy but the <person> wasn ' t just a ship , or even a school . it was something that we made , that ' s inside us . that ' s who <person> is . that ' s what he taught us . i guess what it really was about was . the privilege of sacrifice . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t that right ?
forty .
i ' ll give you twenty and not a penny more .
you got <person> shakin ' already -- <person> left bunker ' s your best angle to the pin .
<person> left bunker -- plugged lie .
coach ! hey , i know this isn ' t a great time . and it ' s too bad about <person> . but what about me ?
you talking about sparta ? <person> , please . you got a better chance of starting a boy band . i ' ll talk to you tomorrow .
we don ' t have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up ' till we get away . it was your idea , remember ? i ' m doing this for you . i ' m doing this so you can fly . fly like a bird . <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> ?
after dark . i ' ll leave the back door unlocked . she quickly hangs up the phone .
we don ' t need to do this . we got the gold , all right ? <person> ' s just get out of here .
i ' m not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around . i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don ' t have the stomach to do what has to be done .
<person> said you ' re <person> .
yes .
<person> , mister , i ' ve got my own money . so , if you don ' t mind .
after what i been through , i don ' t mind anything . <continued_utterance> see , that ' s the whole point . my mind . your mind . where do they fit in ? you know what i mean ?
because no matter how much you claim to `` love '' me , you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of <person> !
<person> to me ! <continued_utterance> loki !
`` <person> . just call me <person> . `` as if you were one of those stupid <number> -year-old girls with no last name . `` hi , i ' m <person> . `` `` hi , i ' m janice . `` what ' s wrong with them ? <person> ' t they know you ' re supposed to have last names ? it ' s like they ' re a whole generation of cocktail waitresses .
i am not a stupid <number> -year-old girl --
let me ask you a related question . we ' ve talked about the supply side , but what about demand ? what is your policy for treating addiction ?
addicts treat themselves . they overdose and then there ' s one less to worry about .
so , what is it you do , <person> . ?
cooper . <person> cooper . oh you know , whatever pays best . little bartending , used to teach tennis , played a little competition . .

you never had a camera in my head . <continued_utterance> something
no , i want to smoke .
i ' m in a mess today , too . i ' m thinking about doing it with <person> .

we were lucky we were able to keep it under control .
every day the sun comes up . says something about us .
<person> , six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student .
i ' m not really sure . i fell in love with <person> . all i want is to be with her . the rest is all a big misunderstanding .
say it .
<person> . i take it back .
i ' m going to take you to the home to see the girl .
from what i ' ve seen , mr . <person> , you have a very good case .

someone crying . a girl . i thought i was crazy .
my client can ' t walk , your honor .
i know full well she can ' t , <person> . you see the padre on your way out and he ' ll punch your ticket . you follow me ? i ' m trying to help you .
look . what ' s that ?
i don ' t know . this is trouble . i ' ll talk to the high aldwin about it tomorrow at the festival .
no , damn it , no ! you ' re gon na wake her up ! it already took me an hour to sing her to sleep .
<person> , but she wants to see her .
<person> ? outta work ? <continued_utterance> no shame in it . what can you do ?
about anything i guess .
<person> ?
nope .
where ' s the sub going ? !
no ! get me out !
ever imagine what itd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast ? . sometimes i think it would be the biggest thrill ?
my god , it better be , darlin , cause itd be the last . what time is it ?
<person> ' t worry , i told him everything he had to know , and i made her four bott .
oh , i ' m telling you , that guy is really starting to get on my nerves !
commander , if you are fired upon , the president will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you . he doesn ' t want to have to do that . it ' s very important that he doesn ' t , or things could go very badly out of control .
i think i understand . what about my men ? if it comes up hot and heavy , and we don ' t have anyone to protect us . i ' m going to be writing letters to parents . i hate writing letters to parents .
doom .
<person> .
no , are you crazy ? and i don ' t want him ever to know . do you understand ? . <continued_utterance> i want to ask you a big favor , <person> . please drop the bluestar deal .
now tell me , why would i want to do that ?
the slimy bastard who ' s going to do it for you . you ' re a jealous man <person> . if you can ' t have <person> to yourself . well , you ' re not the sharing kind . for a moment <person> stares quietly at bobby .
well , i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with <person> .
not me . you got the wrong man .
see ya tomorrow , <person> .
she did . but that ' s not for me anymore , <person> .

we need to tape the interview , <person> . no one will see it but us . now when was this , that mr . <person> gave you the ride ?
about a year ago .
proof . if you had it , you wouldn ' t be fucking around with shitty shakedown routine -- you ' d file . coercion equals confession . so let ' s see you pound it out of me .
where are the files you stole from sergeant <person> .
we would ask you to end <person> ' s banishment .
my first command can not be to undo the allfather ' s last . we ' re on the brink of war with <person> . our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times . <continued_utterance> all of us must stand together , for the good of asgard .
could you step away from the door please ?
all right , all right .
<person> to tell whats shakin in a place like this , honey . you dont want to be walkin in the wrong door .
maybe theres a place we could hear some music . i feel like dancin .
why don ' t you go on ahead head and i ' ll confirm authorization .

them big-haired blondes are a lot smarter ' n us . . how we gon na pay her ?
me either .
i feel like . we can do anything .
it needs no cleaning .
no , of course not . kind of makes you wonder though -- the guys who built it , did they just die the minute they finished , or did the gods give them a second to get out ?
then why are you still using her ?
she ' s all i have , mr . <person> .
<person> ! <person> ! <person> !

<person> in <person> and prejudice . she was too proud --
i thought you hated <person> and prejudice .
<person> <person> ? sure . who could forget ?
i ' ve forgotten and i don ' t know why . did anything unusual happen with him ?

what ?
you are ?
why does everyone find that so surprising ?
i haven ' t been able to recall a single moment of that day . until now .
funerals aren ' t exactly memorable .
this is a working ship . promptness is not a luxury , it ' s a necessity , as is the work to maintain her . had we been ready , i can assure you we would have sailed .
and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here .

he ' s one point away from a tech fall and we ' d lose on criteria .

i got the money all packed . i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . <person> ' ll think maybe me and <person> went away . buy us some time . i know a back road we can take .
it ' s called good music . you should try to familiarize yourself with it , instead of listening to the crap you do .
i listen to crap ?
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?
do i need to remind you what happened to his wife ? to his daughter ? i will stake my reputation that <person> didn ' t kill those guards .
-- it was business . what is that supposed to mean ? i am so sick of that . all it means is it ' s not personal to you , but it ' s personal to me , it ' s personal to a lot of people . what ' s wrong with personal anyway ?
nothing .
no --

the most valuable commodity i know of is information . <person> ' t you agree on that ?
they retrofitted <person> with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it , light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that `` classified '' stuff you didn ' t want me to know about . does the song `` <person> '' mean anything to you ?
yes it does .

because it ' s wreckable . i took another look and i changed my mind .

the headaches will go away -
if she ' s so smart , how did she get caught up with <person> ?
it started out as a straightforward placement .
i ' m thinking about taking a trip .
thought you were going to buy a car .
you don ' t either . take a look at yourself . maybe you ' re scared that someone might actually like you --
and why would that scare me ?
<person> ' t you the lucky one .
when will i hear from you ?
on a cruise around the world .
but why didn ' t you say so on the phone ?
-- <person> , <person> and <person> . i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article ! but you wouldn ' t listen to me . what if there hasn ' t been a coup at all ? what if it ' s you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade ? <continued_utterance> and if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole , you ' re so wrong . it ' s a deuce . <continued_utterance> and it ' s not just me who thinks that . everyone on this so-called excom is telling you exactly the same thing : make the trade , and they ' re going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won ' t trade like <person> , and we do end up in a war . not to mention , that long before that happens , this government will be politically dead .
all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . <person> ? you happy ? so now what ?
you thought it was just .
yes .
<person> ? who cursed it ?
queen bavmorda . her powers govern the elements .
after that .
i ' ll be there . <continued_utterance> love you .

and why have you come here ? to make peace ? you long for battle . you crave it . i see you for what you are , <person> <person> . nothing but a boy , trying to prove himself a man .
i guess we should announce ourselves soon . tell people we ' re coming .

i don ' t think so .
someplace nearby ?
dr . <person> , please don ' t be angry . it ' s <person> . i know i shouldn ' t call this way but --

i know what i said but not now . you won it . <person> . you won it . when they give you the money , that means that you won . we don ' t want to go to court -- is this getting to you . ?
<person> , just ask yourself . what do women really want ? you take these bored housewives , married to the same guy for years . <person> in a rut . they need some release . the promise of adventure . a hint of danger . i create that for them .
so you ' re basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i couldn ' t do it .
like the most beautiful woman on earth .
when will you go home ?
i can ' t wait to see the pictures .
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything .
you ' re smarter than you look , frank . <continued_utterance> and you ' re right . here , take it .
what ? no , i can ' t . this thing must be worth a fortune --
since the beginning .
how . ?
and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
come on , <person> . you used to stand for something . what happened to you , man ? i thought you ' d get it .
sheriff cable ' s already asked me a few questions about <person> . she worked nights for a month . that ' s it .
any friends ?
i didn ' t know who i could trust .
we ' re even . by the way , i did find your husband .
my grandson , y ' know , he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it ! and i know some kids who are totally bald at a year- and-a-half . so , y ' know , how much hair they have . doesn ' t mean a thing .
<person> , he ' s really something , your grandson -- is he good at math too ?
but everything in this game is so realistic . i don ' t think i really could .
you won ' t be able to stop . you might as well enjoy it .
but what about the martian people ? out cause ? i thought you believed in it .
your cause ? that bunch of dead beat radicals ! when i hand in this little number . . i ' ll get real estate rights on the whole of <person> .
wait a minute , estelle , aren ' t you going to punish him ? i ' d say he deserves a good hiding .
cupping the squawking
it doesn ' t . sound life-threatening .
i need a cover . i need for you to pretend we ' re having a scintillating conversation . and you ' re wildly entertained . i know it ' s tough .
can you fly ? set yourself on fire ?
no sir .
your aliens , <person> , your little green men , first landed here millions of years ago . those that didn ' t leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age . in the form of an evolved pathogen . waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet . using us as hosts . <person> this we have no defense . nothing but a weak vaccine . do you see why it was kept secret ? why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known ? <continued_utterance> <person> , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
that ' s why you bombed the building .
but you can ' t tell us what she wanted to talk about .
i could , but it ' s confidential . <person> , the point is , we didn ' t talk . i told her this was not an appropriate time or place .
you bastard ! ! you lying son of a bitch ! !

i hope you don ' t find it too stimulating , <person> .
what did ya do ?
i ' m a robber .
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . <person> . your brother and i , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you . . are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .
<person> , please forgive us for what we have done here tonight . we have lost our way . speaking for myself , let me say .
you don ' t know what you ' re talking about ! there was nothing else i could do ! i can ' t explain it better than that , but you can ' t go on like this because you don ' t know anything about it and you don ' t know what you ' re doing !
ok , i ' m sorry !

we need this vehicle , and we need it without you . but with the keys .
i can ' t do that . i can ' t abandon my vehicle .
she didn ' t say anything . she hung up . have you talked to her ?
no . can you not answer my phone anymore ?
it ' s a tribute . a gesture .
a what ? <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet . <continued_utterance> your brain even smaller than ' em slits for eyes ? <continued_utterance> keep on banging out that ghetto ass shit and you ' ll alert every cop in podunk county .

you know what i ' m talking about . it ' s all over the countryside . five million for her dead body .
the one that left you ?
that ' s right . that one .
maybe you can talk to her . she ' s tired of my apologies but , this pressure i ' m under . of course , that ' s no excuse for what i did . . i can ' t believe what i did . is she all right ? the bull . <person> .
she ' ll be ok .
you are a liar !
no , i ' m not ! <person> , come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you ' re not dead .

how high up does this . arms dealing go ?
<person> . if someone wants you dead , it is <person> . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .

i need you at the georgetown mall in three minutes .
how bad is it ?
well , your ears are in the right place . and the rest of it is . not too bad at all .
<person> , i want to know just one thing . those bastards shoot so much as a bb gun at you ?
sir , it was a milk run , sir .
any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .
. and everyone lived happily ever after .
then i wouldn ' t see you .
actually , i picked up a whole bunch of new clients at the open . lotta guys on the tour said if i could do that much for you , imagine what i could do for them .
am i ?
yeah , you are . i ' m just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me .
fuck you . i got a call today from <person> .
. now who is that . ?
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anesthetic . the type you gave her . would have been negligent . ?
negligent . yes . it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .
this is supposed to be years away .
as far as the public is concerned , it is . the reason you got fired , and i got my second demo into production , is i ' m a lot smarter than you . i never give my best stuff away .
excuse me . <person> ?
the name ' s <person> .
you don ' t know what it feels like to be free of that place .
i don ' t know about that ?
<person> ' t i deposit it in the business account ?
no . it ' s not a legal fee . it ' s a personal fee .
yes but --
she ' s my agent . she ' s my responsibility .
you know what i mean .
to tell you the truth . i ' m excited .
what ' s it going to do , being a plant ?
we got to burn ' em .
no , you assumed .
you ' re going to take a year off ?
you have to leave -
a hundred and fifty years ago , my ancestors took this island - a barren , lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization . and now that i ' m being forced to give it back , i intend to return it in exactly the same condition : a barren , lifeless rock . the gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless british government who wouldn ' t listen .
yes or no .
what do you think ? of course yes ! what ' s involved ?
let ' s go out and do something .
this weekend . i ' ll cancel an operation or two . we ' ll have fun . because i am all about fun .
can we stealth these guys ?
doubtful . with all that coke , they ' ll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two . even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat , we get nothing . mcmanus and if we wait for the money ? <continued_utterance> ten more men at least . in my opinion , it can ' t be done . anyone who walks into this won ' t come out alive . mcmanus i ' m for waiting for the money .
just like that --
i ' m contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers
<person> . but . that ' s the thing . i ' ve never even actually .
why , look who ' s here .
he has debts . he has gambling debts . he owes a lot of money .
how much ?
<person> ' s scenario is unacceptable . and he has more experience than anyone .
there is no expert on this subject , no wise old man .
<person> ' s gone . <person> that may or may not be his leads out to the garage . two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle .
<person> ?
what did she -- do that for ?
hey , <person> !
i ' m begging you . please don ' t kill me ! please !
<person> ' t worry . through me , you will live forever .
why ? it ' s so obvious she ' s just wants him for the money .
i just can ' t win this one , <person> . trust me .
<person> .
what do you think i should do ?
come on , man . i ' ll make a sailor out of you yet .
<person> , or get me drowned .
iraqis . a bunch of them .
what are they doing here ?
why do we sell at a lower cost ? so more people can buy books .
why couldn ' t she sell that way too ?
give me that shit . your wife .
i didn ' t kill my wife .
i ' m her husband . bobby husband . ? <continued_utterance> now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i ' ll break you in half .
<person> , chief . i . i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that ' s all .
i don ' t want to wait for you again . we ' ve been circling each other since the montreal olympics .
you ' re a genius of bad timing . i ' m going back to the party . <continued_utterance> this is a great shot .
i have committed no sin .
no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , <person> , it does not look . <person> ' t you know there has been talk ? <person> about you , not him . <person> about going to the bishop . about having you . shunned !
i mean , it ' s not like he was something normal , like a socialist or an anarchist or something --
it happened in spain . people do really stupid things in foreign countries .
press charges against . me ?
<person> , wake up . as your friend , i think you should see what you did to <person> . the press won ' t get hold of this if you get . away quickly .
that ' s right ! <continued_utterance> i think she ' s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
<person> --
<person> , <person> . what should we do ?
i suggest we steal my father ' s bmw and take a trip to <person> . <person> , you ' ll have to be our translator .
<person> . he ' s wise .
to what ? you looking for him ?
probably .
<person>ooooo --
is that the best shot we can get ?
what ' s to see ?
what ?
he ' s out there . they both go quiet .
i have to talk to him .
<person> matter ? you don ' t trust me ? i ' ll have you know i used to be a college professor . we can work together .
-so you show-up <person> . co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can . <person> can you turn lemons to lemonade .
no cop will testify against other cops . this is why <person> has suddenly disappeared .
i can help you with the mental aspects of the game . you ' ve got <person> to be your swing doctor , i can be your head doctor .
but you said you were a lousy shrink ?
i ' m over at southeast plaza . what was it we need to get for pilates ?
huh ? one of those rubber balls , i think . i ' m headed over there now . <person> out of christmas wrapping paper . would you believe it ?
go shower . you smell .
who is it ?
i guess it ' s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach .
you know what your problem is , <person> , is you ' re so straight . i really mean that . you go to a private school , you wear a bra . no one can have a good time with you ! you know , <person> asked me to go out with him this weekend , and i was really really tempted because i like <person> . a lot . as much as you do . but i told him i couldn ' t , that i didn ' t think it was right because you were my friend --
you are my friend .
i ' m not much good .
me neither .
and what ' s wrong with that ?
do you know what they ' re saying about you ?
just part of life on the road , peanut .
do me a favor , <person> ? dont pick up no more hitchers , okay ?
really ? you sure ?
sure i ' m sure . what is this ?
why ? you ' re the one who believes in nothing . screw the world , or whatever you said .
<person> , so i was full of shit . i thought believing in things was wrong . turns out believing in nothing is worse . you might as well be dead . i ' m not thrilled with the world , but i ' m not gon na let those idiots start killing people . come on , you ' re a cop , we ' ve got to get these guys .
are you pissed off ' cause she ' s gone ?
of course not ! what , are you crazy ? i ' m relieved ! <person> she ' s out of here !
no , i will not tell you a story . you go to sleep now . and be good . <person> will be here while we ' re gone .
<person> .
yeah , what ' s wrong with that ?
only way you ' d ever go into therapy was if the shrink was a doll and you were trying to get her into the rack --
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
of course . i ' ll do what i can . i have to go , before they notice .
the lesson being ?
sometimes you have to do stuff you don ' t want to do . it ' s all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .
what is this newfound love for the frost giants ? you , who would have killed them all with your bare hands .
i ' ve changed .
. go both ways !
why .
mr . <person> claims he didn ' t break into your house .
what did i do ? invite him in so that i could throw eggs at him ?
you mean the chocolate easter bunnies ? we ate them already . <continued_utterance> anyway , you have no idea how many packages we ' ve been getting lately .
maybe we can help . <person> ' s get to work !
<person> , i want to propose something -- as long as you understand this is professional -- we ' re not going out together --
tee it up .
<person> ' t you believe in spooks ?
no . why only -- oh --
no you ' re not you ' re glad , because now you ' ve got a witness . i heard the other police talking last night . they don ' t seem to like you very much .
they kid a lot .
s ' matter with you ? you look like you ' re fading .
the thing ' s kind of heavy .
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
i was wrong . and i was wrong not to tell you <person> was part of sid . i should have told you . i won ' t make the same mistake again .
that ' s right --
i think you don ' t know how to behave around an eight-year-old .
i ' ve come in to do a tough job and that ' s what i ' m going to focus on .
when <person> was forced out , he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor . he said `` when you get into a situation you can ' t get out of , open the first letter and you ' ll be saved . and when you get into another situation you can ' t get out of , open the second . `` soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place . so he opened the first letter . it said , `` blame everything on me . `` so he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm . he got into another situation he couldn ' t get out of , so he opened the second letter , which read , `` sit down and write two letters . ``
yeah . nesting .
i ' m mad at you .
just relax . have you hit the cash machine ?
got cash .
with what ? he doesn ' t have a weapon .
he ' s a soldier . he doesn ' t need a weapon . he ' s got rocks . he ' s got bare hands . <continued_utterance> <person> up !
will you accept a collect call from sheeni saunders ?
absolutely .
i did .
well , well , well , all i can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where -- oh .
yeah , i ' m nervous . so ' s everybody else . but i only got ta come and catch <person> . sixty-seven guys got ta come and get me . <continued_utterance> it won ' t always be like this . y ' know . with me . surrounded by all these guys . snoring . a stripper ex-girlfriend on the floor . my caddie sleeping next to her . all of us damn near broke . won ' t always be like this .
yes it will . yes it will . and it ' s okay .
no , but i ' ve confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much c- <number> is missing ?
enough to level an entire city block .
mary , you seen my baseball ?
no , i haven ' t seen your baseball . <person> , warren , you know you ' re not supposed to leave the yard by yourself .
all right . then what ?
<person> . take that girl and start <person>ning . <person> and don ' t look back . all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by . this time run and don ' t look back and call it living . <person> second , live it right up to the hilt . <person> , <person> . <person> for me . <continued_utterance> <person> , please , if you were ever my friend , if you ever had even the smallest feeling for me , <person> . <person> now . please . <continued_utterance> never mind , <person> . i know . just go . <continued_utterance> now let ' s see , <person> . what was that monkey show you were talking about ?
<person> , you heard him .
what if i ' m right , gloria ? what if i ' m right and <person> ' s wrong ? what do you do if you see a bad thing coming ? <continued_utterance> stick with me on this gloria . i need you .
you and i have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent .
i don ' t think so .
who is it ?
it ' s me .
<person> . that ' s right . so it is settled ? <continued_utterance> good girl .
it will only be settled when i decide which one to ride first .
we ' re gon na have to step in , <person> . <person> boys couldn ' t find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
how will you fix it ?
ask me a question i would normally lie to .
are we going to die ?
then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle . works like a charm : her ass will be white as snow in three hours .
bottle of water , white as snow .
what now ?
i wanted to look you in the eye before i kill you .
that low passed through last night .
it ' s time these boys saw some real blue water .
<person> .
august ! <person> ! she was good ! she came back on her own ! besides , you can ' t do anything now ! the show is still going on .
well , the next time he shows up . bring him over . until then , i ' m not saying a word about this to <person> and neither are you .
if it wasn ' t him , it was his twin . can you think of a reason he ' d want to hide from us ?
that might ' ve been <person> -- -
no , you and <person> . she said it looked like you were arguing .
you think now that <person> ' s dead , there ' s all that money there and i don ' t need you anymore , and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and . pop ! <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you think i would ' ve done it if i wanted to ? what can i do to make you relax , baby ?
you could give me my gun back .
what kind of test ?
i ' m sure a lot of you already know . <continued_utterance> palmer , you and copper tie everyone down . <person> tight .
no . <person> dude , i was distracted .
where are you ? are you watching <person> ' s house again ?
i know . all done .
not bad , nightingale . not bad at all .
<person> heard of him .
you have to come .
well , sure . but he was super-gentle , you know ? i mean , he raped me and all , but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes . i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started , it didn't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick , and after <person> just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich .
and you never told nobody about it ?
excuse me , but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot ?
well , at least i ' m not a great big sissy !
you ' re going to let her just wait there ?
yes . yes i am . that ' s exactly what i ' m going to do . why not ?
that bastard <person> .
who ? . <person> ? .
well , for example , we ' ve spent a fortune developing existenz , but we all know it ' s a risky project . she might have to make changes . it ' s the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem .
a problem with her new game ?
neither did i .
i don ' t know if you ' re really delusional , and i really don ' t care at this point . i just care about her . i ' ve seen the way she looks at you .
you ' ll never believe who called me , <person> . <person> !
what ? ! ? why ?
that ' s for sure .
what we men know how to make is planes , buildings , cars , and all that stuff . it ' s useful , mind
i don ' t know . they ' re pretty quick . fifteen seconds ? <continued_utterance> what the hell is that , anyway ?
cannon fuse .
and i ' m sure i can sue you for violating my constitutional rights !
we ' re the good guys , ms . <person> .
<person> ' t we pray first ?
by all means . would you do us the honor ?
he only met you a few hours before me . he would do the same .
i see that friendship is important to you .
that ' s the life spark . exxence of magic and sorcery !
ouch ! !
<person> ?
yes .

yeah .

so whatta you got for me , sport ? why are you here ?
i could have strangled that guy .
i mean it , i can ' t cope anymore . my parents and i don ' t talk to each other and anyway they live in texas , and the baby needs to get out to the park .
porthos the pirate ?
privateer . there ' s a difference .

. <person> .
<person> , i ' m gon na make you rich , <person> . i ' m gon na make you rich enough you can afford a girl like <person> . remember , power is the best aphrodisiac . this is your wake-up call . go to work .
thereandiacute ; s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
i wonandiacute ; t light the cigars - how about that ?
then why do you call it <person> ' s ?
' cause <person> used to own it .
for ages have i guarded <person> and kept it safe from those who would do it harm . in all that time , never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day . i wish to know how that happened .
then tell no one where we ' ve gone until we ' ve returned .
<person> mr . <person> ever been in custody ?
almost .
no , we ' re a school and we don ' t need toothpicks .
i don ' t know . a young tooth is a terrible thing to waste . i should know . when i was that age nobody gave a hoot about my teeth and now they ' re terrible ! have you checked out flavored floss ?
your park , huh ?
yeah . my park .
mr . <person> , you ' ve made a vast <continued_utterance> look , the drawbridge -- we ' re gon na make it .
i don ' t see any bridge .
dr . <person> ' s not here today , <person> .
no . no .
dad --
it ' s time to tell him . it would be the right thing .
and <person> ' s going to own it all !
right ! he can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from earth . beach condos , ski resorts , you name it .
is it working yet ?
ask me a question i would normally lie to .
i ' m asking how much .
dad --
so <person> and sandra <person> were half- sisters .
and the other girl , <person> . <person> ' s niece .
then come with us .
the war is here ! in towns and vil- lages like this ! <continued_utterance> you ' re chasing a dream .
we going to make it ?
hope so . another ten , fifteen minutes . what i don ' t get is .
who do you suppose they were ? and where did they take her ? a fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this !
now , now , don ' t fret .
hi . is your deal still available ?
what about <person> ?
even if it offended someone , i wouldn ' t eat a fish eye .
why wouldn ' t you eat a fish eye , <person> ?
but you ' re clever . far more clever than anyone else in this realm .
`` this realm ? '' why do you talk like that ?
you ' re more than fine , you ' re absolutely fine .
we ' re fine .
i did try calling her . a few years ago . she wasn ' t listed .
so that was it ? one bump in the road and you gave up ?
you ' re accusing me of stealing your wallet ? i saved your life . twice . why would i steal your wallet ? now , just drink your primrose .
fuck the primrose !
yes , sir , for the past three and a half years .
that ' s good . and you ' d heard about <person> ' s escape ?
<person> , what i just tell you ?
this is a light beer . you can ' t have a light beer ?
you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
i defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .
i ' m not going out anymore . i ' m not getting hurt again . this was the last time . i told you .
you can ' t do anything about that . you might fall between that chair and this television . if that ' s what <person> has planned for you , that ' s what ' s going to happen . you can ' t hide from it in your room .
well , i don ' t know . i got all these things i got ta do back in worcester .
oh .
yeah , so we can see your man strength .
good one , <person> ! see , it ' s already fun .
i don ' t know . it would be small , easy to transport and hide . gold or jewels . probably gold .
yeah ! gold ! how much ?
of course you will , <person> . you never have to worry about that .
please don ' t go till you know where you ' re going . please . !
that ' s not all i said . i said -- i can ' t believe those bastards -- i said we were great , i said people can come and sit and read for hours and no one bothers them , i said we stock <number> , <number> titles , i showed them the new york city section . i said we were a goddamn piazza where people could mingle and mix and be .
a piazza ?
i had my whole life planned . i knew exactly where it was taking me . and then , with the opening of a door , it all vanished .
mr . <person> ? may we have a word ?
how long have you been smoking marijuana ?

me too . <continued_utterance> how ' d it go at the trade show ? you make all the other salesmen jealous ?
yeah . you should have seen it . we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system , the one for the <number> . how you can write up an order and the second the customer ' s name goes into the computer , it starts checking their credit , and if they ' ve ordered anything in the past , and if they get a discount .
i asked you to marry me . i ' m ready for marriage . that ' s responsibility . that ' s growth .
i just think that at some point you ' re going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships .
your good friend <person> .
you think i killed him ? cuz he was an apple ? well , let me tell you something about <person> , <person> --
she told me .

yes . from the highest authority . there are two conditions . the u . n . must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles .
on a bench , across the street . <continued_utterance> you calling me a liar ?
someone ' s gon na take it .
i want <person> to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
what is a sip of coffee going to do ?
when ? when ?

it was just bullshit .
everything okay ?
yeah , <person> . it ' s great .
no . it ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that stemmons file . which i know you won ' t do until you figure out how it will best benefit you .
a mistake to underestimate me now chief . the price to keep your secrets is steep . and you ' re going to pay up . <person> .
what do you got in there ?
my foreseeable future .
how ' s that ?
more .
well , i kind of have a girlfriend -- not a girlfriend , yet , but a girl i like , so i shouldn ' t --

<person> ' t point at me .
you never were a team player . that ' s why you never had any friends .

i don ' t believe i know where the upstairs guest room is .
can i say something here ? <person> asked me to come and talk to you , because it ' s her opinion that you ' re not gon na find what you ' re looking for the way you ' re looking for it --
how would she know ?
i want you to call <person> .

i guess we should announce ourselves soon . tell people we ' re coming .

but it ' s a game that everybody ' s already playing ! existence , it ' s wonderful !
four is what ?
she looks like a moth , <person> .
i admit he has his moments of insanity but he ' s really a very generous , charming guy .
you don ' t get it , do you ? when <person> feeds your arm to a lion - that ' s the real <person> . the one who ' s generous and charming - that ' s the insane <person> .
what are you talking about ? you were never an alky , you were a cokehead .
<person> , well when you quit blow , you got ta quit the booze , too .
maybe we are crazy for doing this . but if we do it , we do it right . i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldn ' t have to do it again .
not much chance of that . <person> ' s an idiot .
my assembly bay .
is that it over there ?
what ' s with that <person> ? yeah , sure , take a look around . there ' s no one here anyway .
you ' re right . there ' s no one here .
<person> ? this wouldn ' t last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?

with all the respect i can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories , <person> , trust me - you ' ve crossed that bridge .
<person> . <person> your dinner .
that one shook the entire building !
everyone has got ta be concerned about <person> conlon ' s bravery getting him into trouble here .
i hardly think i need advice from someone who --
i concede i bring out the worst in you , but let me help you not to say something you ' ll just torture yourself about for years to come . she starts to smile and he removes his hand . they look at each other . <continued_utterance> i hope you ' re better soon . it would be a shame to miss new york in the spring .
it happened in spain . people do really stupid things in foreign countries .
absolutely . they buy leather jackets , they go see <person> , they ride in gondolas , they eat in restaurants where guitarists sing malaguena sola <person> , but they don ' t fall in love with fascist dictators .
<person> ? how ' s our new witness ?
d ' you find the obstetric nurse ?
<person> . i see . how much do you want ? <continued_utterance> you want more than this ? <continued_utterance> you want something else ?
drop the package . put your hands behind your head . you ' re under arrest .
<person> . thank you .
you bet . <person> .
he ' s cut all over , but this leg here ' s got the worst of it .
it ' s probably tetanus . it ' s no good .
i wonder if <person> could ever write a poem ? both of them drift off . donna do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster ?
faster and faster . for a long time you wouldn ' t feel anything . then you would burst into fire . forever .

<person> is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it ' s when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you ' re afraid of .
you afraid of the dark ?
that ' s what we ' re doing here . national interest . national security . only this time it ' s not gold . it ' s uranium .

for crying out loud , why don ' t you just leave it at that . you win .
i couldn ' t have won . i smell a rat .
<person> to me how you could think that i shouldn ' t know about this . <person> to me how this wouldn ' t be relevant to me . as a parent .

<person> . i ' m cool with everything . you ' ve long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . you ' ve always had an itch for the good life . i ' m happy for you . this couldn ' t happen to a nicer guy . <continued_utterance> but just for the record , my <person> is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my <person> is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas . you seem to have forgotten they opened <person> ' s family market so they could build something permanent , a legacy , for us . their kids .
i didn ' t forget .
how much ?
five percent should be fine for now , which is , let ' s see , twenty thousand dollars . of course i ' ll be splitting my commission with your friend . he is a very sweet man .
you expected whips , chains , merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood ?
at least it ' s not another <number> -h meeting or a big brother barbecue .
why ?
goddamnit , <person> , you won ' t go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z .

warm .
cock-blocked ? <continued_utterance> we ' ll have to resume this another time , <person> . it ' s been an emotionally exhausting weekend . my parents are in an uproar over <person> . he ' s moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the garage .
<person> ' s not a floozie .
why ' s that ?
he ' s got a mean streak . and he and <person> had been at each others throats for months . have <person> picked up . he likes to loaf at those nigger jazz joints in watts .
<person> , stop it ! <person> ' t let him do it !
i ' ll <continued_utterance> damn ! <continued_utterance> stay where you are or i ' ll kill her !
how very brave . <person> . i won ' t torture you . i ' ll torture her . i can bring back <person> . let him have her . plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby can ' t be made . ida grabs a nearby knife , walks up to sheryl . <continued_utterance> or maybe we can just start dicing . all we need is a healthy heart , brain and uterus . she don ' t need the rest of her fingers , or toes . or her nose , ears . i could carve out her eye right now .
no !
all the professionals keep them in the trunk .
not <person> .
i made our reservation for <number> : <number> . we ' re going to be late .
here she is now .
my cheekbones . what do you think of ' em ?
i like your cheekbones . <person> , are you all right ?
we could feed the entire network , honey . <person> .
by the way , did you call ted fein ?
why didn ' t you mention it before ?
i didn ' t want to hurt your feelings .
it ' s hard to answer . <person> better than if she wasn ' t there .
quite a recommendation . can ' t wait to do it .
no ! i ' m not having a heart attack !
that could be a heart attack , <person> . you should lie down .
a comer . <number> medium-body jets . <number> pilots , flies northeast , canada , some florida and <person> routes .
. don ' t like airlines , lousy unions .
you ' re my son .
what more than that ? <continued_utterance> the casket wasn ' t the only thing you took from jotunheim that day , was it ?
i can see that . why ?
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break <number> bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance . it ' s insane , i can ' t take it anymore .
you ' re stalling , verbal .
give a guy a break , huh ?
that ' s right .
<person> ' t it a little late ?
sure kinko .
<person> ?
and you met <person> how ?
just dumb luck . i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me . i went home that night , shaved my beard , and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back .
what ' s that ?
he ' s been under a lot of pressure recently . he snapped . he had a nervous breakdown . it ' s the saddest thing i ' ve ever seen . <person> ' s be honest about it , nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars ' worth of aluminum siding free .
or just knock us over . <person> , use the bomb !
it ' s out last one . we can ' t kill them all .
i don ' t know .
how long ' s the job ?
exactly .
i ' m gon na walk back to the gas station for help . you ' ve got the heater and the radio , so you should be all right here . though i really think you should consider coming with me .
come on , out with it .
i don ' t think sylvia ought to go on , unless you cut out the high kicks and let her do some easy waltzes . <person> easy waltzes .
do you know she wants to take <person> back to ohio ?
yeah . she just told me today .

stop calling me vernon .
maybe the bureau . or those bastards at treasury . i ' ll take care of it . i hate this shit , <person> . you cut their balls off for me . i ' m counting on you . <continued_utterance> what ' s your first move ?
a hot shower . i haven ' t changed clothes in two days .
had you heard of him before ?
on the street ? a few times . outside stuff . <person> was working for a guy who was working for a guy who got money through <person> . that kind of shit . could be an old badge . a hex sign to keep people from fucking with you back when a name meant something .
tell <person> to get the fuck off !
<person> , he just ate . <person> just stares at his friend . sully nineteen months i been sober .
what if i kept it ?
i ' m listening .
<person> .

you feel like everybody else is inside , and you ' re stuck on the outside . it turns you mean . it turns you ugly . and one day do you hear me , <person> ? one day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face .
i ' m already on a first name basis with these dudes , i got a deal set up , you want me to hammer it or not ?
we ' re not after car thieves here .
he loved her .

<person> , i ' ve got a little problem . i ' m having a valuable package delivered to me on sunday , but i ' m not going to be home . i ' ve got to do the hawaii-tahiti-australia route , so can i have the package delivered here instead ?

well , don ' t say i didn ' t warn you when things go your way .

<person> . that ' s my husband .
i ' m giving you permission to take a vacation , <person> . not a vacation from your work . not a vacation from your daily life . but a vacation from .

yeah . just down the street .
they call me old man <person> . i ' m what you might call the founder of the feast . now maybe you ain ' t <person> , but we skylark through your dingy little country just about any time we damn well <person> and big-hat , crummy- lookin ' free-holes stumblin ' around in the dark ain ' t allowed . <person> po-lice , huh ? think you ' re bad medicine , don ' t you ? hell , i ' ve let stronger stuff run down my leg . so next time we come <person> step aside . get in our hair again , we ' ll saw your prods off with butter knives and stuff ' em in your gobs . <person> ' t kiddin ' neither . you been told . now git .

and he asked you to live with him ?
there ' s no other word for it .

-<person> was my snitch , so it ' s my scene .
then get <person> on the horn , so you can relay that order . i ' m here on his word . now , what happened ?
i don ' t want to drag this out too long for <person> .
i know . <continued_utterance> how about in the meantime , you don ' t sleep in the guestroom anymore ? you sleep in our room . i ' ll sleep down here .
like i said ; so ?
they ' re cancelling all leaves , all passes . no more drills . we stand at full ready starting --
you ' re lucky i am not wasting you .

well i ' m glad your done lying now , just in time to lose your practice . that ' s how we survive , <person> . your family . you ever think of that ?
yeah . all the time .
<person> , what a pwetty wittle name , <person> ! i didn ' t know you had a baby .

look out the window and see if you see them , i ' m gon na try to
that ' s a hallmark of <person> ' s philosophy right there .
<person> is shocked . he thought he had a free pass into the second round , but instead he ' s going home . he dominated the fight the entire way , but fell prey to a very technical finish .
he was premature , wasn ' t he ?
only by two weeks .
not good .
what the hell happened ? we used to be good .
<person> for you . now why don ' t you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn ' t go through all this for my benefit .
it ' s your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
if there ' s a big yard , can i get a collie ?
sure . oh , honey , i feel a wind at my back : i think this is going to work out good .
<person> . <continued_utterance> excuse me ?
i ' m fine , thank you . <continued_utterance> take a look at our young friend .
it ' s your own fault . we never should have endangered a civilian . you should have put an agent into place .
there was no time . <person> is too smart for that ; he would have spotted the agent a mile away .
<person> . <person> . here ' s the deal . <person> was with a prostitute in las vegas .
what ?
<person> , you know you remind me of so much that went wrong in my life . when i heard you were here , i made a special effort to come and see you . i see you are still a pile of wet chicken feathers .
oh lord .
-- <person> was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard . he came out , approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was <person> . he tried to get back into the trailer , but the car came highballing at him . he started running for the open grass . with the car moving , <person> hung his shotgun out the window , took aim -- missed once , hitting the shitter -- fired again , and severed <person> ' s spine . <person> fell , rolled , and came to a stop in the grass . and some chicken feed . <person> chicken feed with four days mold . electromagnetic printing .
was-te . ' cept for one thing . <person> looks twice was nowhere near there . ya see , when <person> was twelve years old , his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near <person> .
you ' re right . i don ' t believe it .
are you in love , <person> ?
yes , tonight . we ' re going to be -- she looks at his watch .
fashionably five minutes late .
come on , we ' re not about pickin ' fights . <person> gon na keep a little order , that ' s all .
<person> ?
and , of course , we are .
well , you never can tell these days , can you ?
everybody looks good in the tropics .
since i haven ' t been able to find <person> since coming back , you ' re going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean ?
it was an accident . you saw it was an accident .
i ' m just trying to help you guys out . it doesn ' t hurt to know something about saudi arabia .
he jumped fritz .
i ' m sure he did . and where is your young partner this day ?
what was it ?
when we were young men in the military , your father and i were recruited for a project . they told us it was biological warfare . a virus .
go home , find a wench , live long and prosper .
why can ' t i stay with you ?
i pack up and go somewhere else . grace somewhere else . i ' ve never been anywhere else . just once . years ago . went to the state fair . it was nice , but it wasn ' t nothing . <continued_utterance> i couldn ' t stay in this place . i wouldn ' t . i ' d just pick up , do whatever i had to do , and get out . <person> looks to <person> and smiles .
sometimes i feel the exact same way .
have you been harboring this shit all along ? i never talked to her .
whatever . i mean - who am i , if i can ' t . be the one who tells you you ' re not ugly ? aw , give me a courtesy laugh . come on !
what should we do with it ?
mind if i borrow a couple of your tools for a second ?
yes . price .
<person> ?
you ' ve been there ?
hell , i ' ve had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . <person> ' t much you can do when you feel like that ' cept tough it out .
lucky guess .
<person> . she left the store to me , and i ' m going to leave it to my daughter .
your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . `` like a woman , purring with ecstasy . ``
i ' m ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .
<person> !
<person> !
that ' s a relief .
i went to the hotel . <person> shot at somebody . i found a shell casing . i ' ll have it analyzed in the morning .
where would i start ?
why here ?
these are the rebels .
fuck they are . this is a government convoy to calunda .
then the next time she squawks , walk right up to her and spit in her eye . that ' s what i ' d do !
oh !
i know , but i ' m a mess . worse than usual .
<person> , if this is an emergency , go to the emergency room . if not , call dr . <person> and i ' m sure he can help you .
no . i ' ll take a look at it . who do i have at ten-thirty ?
<person> .
they ' re all nice , but <person> keeps rushing me , keeps talking about marriage . and i don ' t really want to get married -- not now anyway .
that ' s fine with me . i wish you would ' ve stayed married to dad .
that ' s not in delaware .
no .
which is basically reincarnation , right ?
no , they ' re not really the same thing . reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal recurrence is when you
your husband ! ?
<person> -- run !
<person> ' t worry . don ' t worry . i ' ll take care of it tomorrow .
<person> , my chest hurts . i always taught you , bb , never walk out of a place without a signed contract . somebody ' s word ain ' t spit .
maybe , yeah . <person> , i don ' t know .
well what do you think happens when you die ?
' course . <person> . one of the first raiders .
sir <person> . like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in . bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me . <person> the white knight .
what ?
<person> ' t you put this on me . <person> ' t do it , don ' t do it , don ' t do it , don ' t .
did the tuning fork ring in your loin ?
i wouldn ' t go that far .
with your mom ? did she do that to your eye ?
no . she ' s not even there . she ' s in a clinic or hospital or whatever .
i don ' t understand the problem ! <person> ' s a nice guy !
<person> is a patient . he followed me here from new york which is bizarre . but even if it weren ' t bizarre , my daughter seeing a patient that i ' m treating is entirely inappropriate .
you ' d recognize it if you tasted it .
i doubt it , darling . <continued_utterance> you want to keep him happy .
security ?
two bodyguards . <person> good . mcmanus give us time to check it out ? <continued_utterance> i ' d expect nothing less . mcmanus we ' ll call you . <continued_utterance> take your time . <person> . a .

oh my god .
but something went wrong . something about a real memory . and then those men . tried to kill me .
once you ' ve been driven off a bridge at <number> miles an hour , somehow you don ' t invite happiness in without a full body search .
well , at the risk of boring you , i can present the alternate argument . i once knew a guy who was a real loner . and one day he woke up at <number> , with two daughters who lit his life up with purpose . suddenly he goes to endless school plays , he gets home at <number> : <number> for the evening discussion , and he has the time of his life . his favorite <person> was once <person> , and now it ' s <person> .
now , calm down . we were just havin ' a little fun .
<person> like you ' ve got a real fucked up idea of fun . now turn around . <continued_utterance> just for the future , when a woman ' s crying like that , she ' s not having any fun !
jesus . is that what he told you ?
he said he hasn ' t had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks he ' s kind of . a . . . <continued_utterance> . loser . but i ' m sure your book is so good that he ' ll be able to keep his job . <continued_utterance> <person> here .
fine , fine . but i was thinkin ' , you know what this town really needs is a race track .
actually , you know , that ' s not a bad idea , send a signal we ' re growing up .
you remember that boy who lost his mind , <person> ? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark . he wouldn ' t miss a one . make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe . he would pick up a brick and say `` go on in there brick and hit somebody '' and it would find its mark .
i was afraid to go to <person> because of him .

<person> ' t you hear me ? girard --
sit . <continued_utterance> your father was a proud man . and he had a right to be . i never knew one as brave or as kind . he knew that his strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor . that is why he dedicated his life to his country and his king . that is why he gave his life , for both . <continued_utterance> i watched you this morning and saw someone i knew . you have your father ' s heart , his will to fight , his courage . but these gifts have no value unless they are given . <continued_utterance> it ' s time for you find your fortune with men as brave and as bold as you are . in paris . with the king ' s musketeers . you ' ll need this .

the appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post-sanderline <person> , so your suspension will be recorded but sealed . and kept quiet for now-
i mean really ! that business with your tongue . what is that ? that ' s disgusting !
and , oh my god , that other thing , that pointing to your lap ? what ' s that supposed to mean exactly ? does that mean pull over , i want to show you what a big fat slob i am or .
one twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus . believe me , mr . x , i ' ve put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and i don ' t feel the urge to stop just yet . so think carefully before you tell me : is `` kiss my ass , hop- along '' your final answer ?
no .
<number> days is not enough . my wife and i have three jobs between us and that doesn ' t cut it . so , what do you suggest ?
let me ask you a question : have you considered bankruptcy ? it ' s a viable option . there ' s no shame in it these days .
why not miracle waters ? i ' ve drunk the oil of monkey glands , been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses . after all that , this sounds downright peaceful .

like i said , open container , <person> . i . , misdemeanor possession . <person> to make it disappear . for you , poof , it ' s gone . <continued_utterance> one thing bothers me . that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he ' s lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what ' s your daughter on ?
i don ' t know what you mean .
seriously ? i ' m doing all right ?
you ' re taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you ' re still keeping your small town values . you ' re not letting all this `` stuff '' spoil you .
i tell you what . i ' ve got an idea . do you mind my guys working on a saturday ? ' cos if my crew can work on saturday next , that ' ll free my guys up on monday . <person> , that ' ll really help me out on another job . <person> , if we can do that , i think i ' ll be able to knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job . you see , i ' ve got an overlapping situation on monday . i don ' t want to go into it . what do ya think ?
yep .
no .
i feel so bad . i had nightmares all night long . they all knew you at that place .

i ' ve spent over <number> hours interviewing him . <person> killed <person> and <person> because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered <person> . after seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should be done . the question is , what does <person> have to do with <person> <number> . <number> ?
i know who would know .
mother of god .
the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the bosphorus , cut off the black sea .
<person> is a beautiful girl , with an extraordinary power . one that even
forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , i wonandiacute ; t feel any guilt about what i do to you .
i ' ve seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it , screaming , into a bottle . the bilges are full of them .
what do you mean ?
i ' m not talking to you anymore .
and you don ' t want to show me your face .
well , i had a conversation with <person> , so . maybe i ' ll go with him . <person> is gon na need a new partner because <person> is going into used cars .

i never heard of it .
what did you find out ?
call off the manhunt looking for me . i didn ' t kill the transport guards .
what was it like , the first show ?
the ultimate live television . in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .
what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway ?
then i guess <person> can kiss that arm of his goodbye . he don ' t use it for no good deeds anyway . <continued_utterance> you come all the way out here to watch <person> ?

indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind .
this is a working ship . promptness is not a luxury , it ' s a necessity , as is the work to maintain her . had we been ready , i can assure you we would have sailed .
i joined the musketeers and a strange thing happened . i got my faith back .

professor tripp . ?

so why play into his hands ? we can protect you .
we tried that already . remember ?
you know , this is as much your fault as it is mine .
what are you doing here ?
he wants to talk to you .
you know what we should do ? you and me should kill the biggest boar ever -- just huge ! -- and take it back to the village . just to show them . and we won ' t let anyone else eat it . they ' ll have to watch us eat it .
if it ' s that huge how would we carry it back ?
i ' m not trusting you again .
you loved me once , you must have --
that is very thoughtful of you . i haven ' t had time to tend to my garden like i should .
you know <person> and i are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother .
this one was under the windshield of my car .
you ' ve never been sick ?
it was just like before , wasn ' t it ? wasn ' t it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you ' re after , this time there was only one other person involved .
enough !
<person> ? ! where ? !
down there . just down there . a helpless toy . it ' s . it ' s trapped , <person> !
wa-shee is like . a dumpling . <person> tallow we put in stew . i think he was calling you chubby boy .
<person> . <continued_utterance> you ever see that car before ? <continued_utterance> who ' s it belong to ? <person> ignores him . ray studies her reaction . <continued_utterance> help me , <person> . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t see you today , <person> . <person> .
i thought he was in mexico .
maybe he ' s in mexico , but today he was in new york . the most brilliant and reclusive novelist in the history of the world is here , in this neighborhood . he may be living on this very block .
no .
that ' s why you never had a bioport . you were one of them .
there ' s things that are bothering me .
like what ?
you deserve as good a life any other girl .
am i still a girl ? i feel so old .
bigger than your own ?
a lot bigger .
what else have you been giving him ?
i crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea .
fun though , wasn ' t it ?
you ' d die for fun ?
you ' ll only thaw it out .
come on , <person> , we could have a great week up in vermont .
six . six . six . six . i ' m thinking one . whose one ?
mr . motor .
uh-huh .
jolly old town !
now , dr . <person> ' s testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?
it ' s my opinion it took him much longer . nine . ten minutes . there ' s too much brain damage .
and only in soap flakes without any artificial color or scent . and then rinsed three times in very hot water .
rinse three times .
yes , you did ! you looked right at me -- twice .
yes , that ' s a technique of public speaking , but i didn ' t ask you specifically . you chose to come . you got ta take some responsibility for that . and there ' s no point coming if you ' re just gon na keep whining about every little -- cougar that attacks you . you want some or not ?
what ' s going on , <person> ?
shhhh .
about an hour and a half , because that ' s all the longer i ' ve been gone .
actually , it ' s been about three hours . you ' re the one thinks that car ' s so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?
why ?
just to annoy you .
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of <number> million dollars .
we need padded chairs .
is that old crab still with you ? <person> , you said you were putting her up for a month -- it ' s been a year and a half .
ah , she ' s okay .
and i do not plan to meet him . why do i get the feeling that you are in here somewhere ?
i came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out . well how am i supposed to meet someone ?
i won ' t calm down . i can ' t do this . we can ' t do this . it won ' t work . it will not work .
it has worked .

how ' s that ?
solo works just as well .
<person> .
counting the what ? what does that have to do with the price of butter ?
i was just trying to make conversation .
how do you know it ' s a she ?
i saw her in the water . beside me . she was filling the bathtub .
i hear you . i ' ll stay in touch .
that ' s more like it . where are you at , anyway ?
with all due respect , mr . <person> , what ' s to prevent you from doing the same thing ?
cause i have a way around all this , a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again . what do you say we cut to the chase . i ' m asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut . <continued_utterance> and seven more hours a month .
sure you do , it ' s good for you .
where ' s <person> ?
well when you do , that ' s my answer . i ' m sorry . it ' s not up to me .
why , you married ? <continued_utterance> i ' m not asking you to have my children , just a pizza . how about saturday ?
and me .
. and <person> and <person> and <person> .
<person> --
i need you there with me . i need your expertise on this . the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by .
do you know what we do with people come round here ? you know what we do with people come in our business ? <continued_utterance> we cut the achilles tendon . your feet flop around like a marionette . you ain ' t walkin ' nowhere no more . <person> good , tough guy ? or maybe instead you wan na tell me something . <continued_utterance> <person> doing here ?
oh , i don ' t know . it was an accident .
it ' s always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road .
but -- what happens if i -- - cs -- glinda speaks to dorothy o . s . in f . g . --
give us a kiss .
stop . <continued_utterance> how do i look ?
where was he trying to go ?
anyplace but here . <continued_utterance> but he ain ' t going to make it .

and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr . <person> ?
it is just a regular card .
<person> , i can take everything you got with that deck . it is marked . now i ' m going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere .
molly and i are circling each other . i can feel it .
she the enemy , boss .

' least they don ' t scare women .
you ' re the boss . one thing , though . <continued_utterance> how you gon na get back to ' em ?
he ' s shanking his love life so he ' s shanking the golf ball .
must be true love .
well , yeah , of course , but . let me , uh , let me call <person> .
they wouldn ' t want to talk to you if they knew you had never had a bioport installed . it ' s company policy , you know . they want you to be passionate about your work . <continued_utterance> besides , once you ' re ported , there ' s no end to the games you can play .
all the same , i still want to call her . i know it sounds crazy -- <person> sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but , i don ' t know , maybe i can help her out . the poor thing ' s had it tough -- she ' s in a wheelchair for <person> .

no it isn ' t . they don ' t trust the people that feel this way . but these people are right . and the <person>nedys are wrong . we need you to tell ' em , <person>ny . they ' ll listen to you . <continued_utterance> <person> and <person> are good men . but it takes a certain character , moral toughness to stand up to --
-- you listen to me . nobody , nobody , talks about my friends that way . you ' re fucking here right now because of the <person>nedys . they may be wrong . they make mistakes . but they ' re not weak . the weak ones are these ' people ' who can ' t speak their own minds .

<person> does horrible things to a developing young mind .
all the people working with us are really doing it ' cause they hate to see suffering .
you never know what ' s in the heart and just because you can cry doesn ' t make you human .
he ' s an idiot , and he ' s not nearly as hard as he thinks .
how tough you have to be to make the army ? all you ' ve got to do is shoot a gun , and stop a bullet .

thanks for doing that . <continued_utterance> i ' ll be right back down .
do you have time to eat .
that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn ' t have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations , <person> --
but you can ' t just send me away ! i ' ve read your book , i ' ve been doing what you told me , but i ' ve completely relapsed ! a little time would mean so much . <person> .
<person> , i ' m driving away now and i don ' t want you to bother me again . you came for my advice , correct ?
i ' m in a mess today , too . i ' m thinking about doing it with <person> .
<person> , you are such a crack up . you don ' t even like <person> . is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight .
-- and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail ?
i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry , <person> , i ' m really sorry . ! <continued_utterance> <person> .

no . it ' s what it looks like . a big i . e . d . - ten gallons of astrolite . <person> , get everybody out of here and clear the building .
somebody ' s got to stay with you --
i was hoping you could tell me .
you steal an old bomb , small by today ' s standards , about the size of the one that destroyed <person> , take the plutonium core out of it , intending to use it . to make a bigger , better bomb . <continued_utterance> i have to get after that core . this is my ass .
i do ? i mean , yeah , i do .
i have to admit , i am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
she ' s beautiful , you know ?
no one must know ! especially him . you must appear to live your life normally , conveying nothing . the security of this nation depends on it . can you do that ?
i think so .
where are you ?
we ' re on our way home . i just . we ' re running a little late .
you can go with <person> . he ' s taking <person> to school . but you ' ll have to hurry .
<person> . <continued_utterance> thanks .
ok . ok . <person> , just go get ready for practice and i ' ll deal with it .
fine but i told her i ' m staying with you guys until we leave .

that information is classified . you ' re there to gather information on their operations , period .
call me crazy , but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gon na hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
that ' s what i am to you , isn ' t it ? swamp trash . it ' s what i am to everybody , just like my mom .
<person> bitch . <continued_utterance> why do you make me hurt you ? it ' s like you want it or something . <continued_utterance> god , you are scared , aren ' t you ? <continued_utterance> and this is going to make you feel better , make you trust me .
but she ran away .
that ' s right .
<person> , it ' s <person> <continued_utterance> nope , haven ' t walked the plank yet . there was this guy back in college who was bothering me . got kind of ugly -- a restraining order , the whole bit . <person> , when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution .

<person> , <person> , you should ' ve told someone .
who ?
pulling files is another thing .
to sneak a few here and there when you can .
well , to be honest , the idea of getting old with <person> was kinda startin ' to get to me .
i can see that .
my wife , <person> . my son , <person> . my daughter , <person> . my sister , <person> .
<person> . i was close ! what a wonderful family !
what department is she with ?
she ' s with <person> .
<person> was taller .
there ' s only one rule , d ' <person> -- stay alive .

i ' m asking you to help me , man . i got word yesterday that i did really well on those tests -- but that ' s not enough . i ' ve got to cheat and lie -- but i don ' t care : this is my one chance to get out of here !
no point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end .
<person> . from the beginning .
<person> . wait a sec . it ' ll be dark soon .
where ' s your sense of adventure ?
<person> ' s <person> meant something . <continued_utterance> i mean it . it means something to me . it ' s one of the reasons i came to school here . to be in your class . to be taught by you . it ' s one of the reasons i wanted to become a writer .
well , for that , if nothing else , <person> , i ' m sorry .
let me see it .

you loaded these songs . you don ' t need to be so impressed with yourself .
i don ' t know , <person> . i do love you , but i don ' t want to spend the rest of our lives on the run .
it ' s a small price to pay .
you ' re crazy .
<person> , i ' ve got news for you . i got through to a friend ' s voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious . i ' m sure she ' s called the cops by now .
<person> . what time is it ?
time for you to die .
been a while since we had a couple go missing . twelve months ago the last ?

somebody broke in .
now who ' d go and do .
because i think it ' s primitive , ok ? i think it ' s a fairy tale .

yep .
<person> , <person> , <person> .
part of my job , sir .

if you ' re worried about anything , let ' s take that blood test of yours .
if we ' ve got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn ' t be in any condition to do anything about it . you play chess ?
we ' re gon na have to come up with some kind of plan or it ' s just gon na wait us to death .
well , i was wondering if we could .

<person> , i ' m worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth . i ' m thinking i was right never to have a bioport installed .
but you have one now . and you ' re ported in .
<person> to me , both of you . this is no good . this is trouble we <person> ' t need . for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family . do this and you throw it all away . you saw what happened to <person> .
come on , we ' re not about pickin ' fights . <person> gon na keep a little order , that ' s all .
no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?
all for show . just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing .
if there is a <person> he ' ll be looking for you .
where ' s your head , <person> ? where do you think the pressure ' s coming from ? <person> - or whatever you want to call him - knows where i am right now . he ' s got the front burner under ' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . <person> was just to deal with you assholes . i got a whole new problem when i post bail .
look , it ' s with <person> -- i ' ve been after her for months already .
so what ! if you leave me alone with this kid , i swear i ' ll pack up and be outta here by morning .
get ready !
light it , man ! light it ! !
they went bust . <continued_utterance> you got ta leave .
what ' re they doing ?
why do you think ?
it ' s hard to answer . <person> better than if she wasn ' t there .
thelma ! <person> !
he knows .
hughes .
this is almost over <person> -- i ' ll give <person> the five-grand back .
neither could i .
if i had to get up on saturday morning knowing that i was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that sunblock --
no , i don ' t believe you .
well , <person> did call me into his office today . and he did tell me i didn ' t have my old job anymore .
would you please let me --
-- what happened ? !
not the only one .
the fire ' s got the temperature way up all over camp . won ' t last long though .
do you want me to carry your pack for you ? <person> blurts out emphatically .
no ! <continued_utterance> no , i ' ve got it .
you are a lone reed . <person> looks puzzled . <continued_utterance> you are a lone reed waving in the breeze standing strong and tall in the corrupt sands of commerce .
i am a lone reed . i am a lone reed .
we find the concept brilliant , but new york is difficult for new restaurants . how can we be certain that our money will be returned in the long run ?
it ' s simple gentlemen , design versatility . a restaurant that can change with taste without losing the overall aesthetic . our atmosphere won ' t be painted on the walls .
that ' s <person> , the gag king .
<person> guessed .
what if they call him ?
they won ' t . that ' s not their jurisdiction .
you have something to do with this ?
well . i thought of calling your photographs `` pictures from a lost war '' . i ' m great at captions -- the new york editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell <person> was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance , got you a cover , me a feature , and packaged a class struggle in two words . <person> , eh ?
there ' s no god , there ' s no devil , i hate the god damn world ! i want to die !
<person> , son . you just need to get your feet back under you , that ' s all . come on , boy , let ' s kick south . <person> to the old playground .
put your shoulders back .
what ?
first of all , mr . <person> , you can ' t just come barging in here . and what makes you think it ' s his birthday ?
it ' s in the bible , see . you better go buy him a present . <person> , <person> . let me give him the gift ; cuban cigars -- <person> , his favorite and hard to get .
it ' s a long story , but yeah , more or less .
<person> . you ' re going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . <person> , at six o ' clock . look it up . we ' re taking a trip . be there at six and you ' ll have plenty to tell your people .
go wash your hands and i ' ll get molly ready .
can i bring some toys ?
well , isn ' t there any way for you to believe that without calling it god , or religion , or whatever term it is you object to ?
yes . i believe that .
i ' m not gon na take it .
that ' s fine for you . but do i go back and say i interviewed <person> ? do i go back and say i missed the biggest story of the war ? or do i say <person> was stone cold dead -- that ' s the information , isn ' t it ? or do i say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol ' revolutionary campfire ? can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was . sympathetic ? journalists don ' t fall in love . which story do you want me to tell ?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted .
how old are you , son ?
he might like it if he ever went there and tried it .
oh , have another cookie , marian -- keep your strength up .
you are in idiot .
<person> told you ?
that won ' t be possible .
i ' m sorry i haven ' t always treated <person> the way -- i should have . she deserves better . <continued_utterance> i care for her .
it ' s colder in there . -
you ' re right .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
oh , i see , i see .
no , you don ' t see . there are three of us sharing this place .
<person> , take a look around you . what does everything you see have in common ?
er . i don ' t know . it ' s all owned by you , that ' s obvious . humm . everything ' s from a garage sale !
what ? ! what d ' you think ? !
oh .
<person> , right ! good one ! oh god , you ' re serious .
you want those college credits or not ?
there were still cars when i got here . i thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow ?
what time is it ?
hey , don ' t i have any rights ?
yes , you do . to a swift and speedy trial . <continued_utterance> court is now in session .
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we can ' t be sure .
in other words , we collectively don ' t know shit .
yeah , is she nice ?
she ' s okay . she ' s pretty .
exactly . but don ' t expect everything all at once . even a baby occasionally falls and hits his head .
<person> step around the office . <person> step around the office ! <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> : hi fam ! he ' s a genius !
it ' s probably not a good idea .
<person> .
yeah . look in here . <person> at it from this angle . <person> puts his head inside the truck .
i see it . <person> , it ' s on the inside , <person> . the inside is your territory .
what the hell ' s going on here ?
we ' re in love with your roommate .
well , here we are , eh ?
<person> ! <person> up !
this guy asked for advice , i ' m giving him advice , <person> ? if you ' re so paranoid , why don ' t you run home and chain your kid to his crib ?
anyway , i think someone should call the cops .
we had a class together , you know .
<person> ?
. <person> . i think <person> only knows those two trails . well . between those , i ' d pick <person> . <person> will shoot you to the top , but there ' s not as much to see . <person> weaves through <person> ' s <person> , it ' s a better hike and prettier all around view .
what do you think ?
stars .
yes . but not our stars . <continued_utterance> this is the star alignment for our quadrant , this time of year . so unless <person> decided to take the day off . those are someone else ' s constellations . <person> ' s intrigued , in spite of himself .
what c- <number> . was <person> talking about ?
let me put it to you this way . whether i ' m here . or whether i ' m not . i ' m leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
i ' ll do my best . !
how old ' s your son ?
he ' s lying . two , four , oh , six was definitely the number . <continued_utterance> i never believed he was dead .
c ' mon , <person> , a lotta times they don ' t find a body . you know what the currents are like in that water .
we find that your subscription lapsed .
my subscription lapsed three years ago .
i am going to take a wild guess that this isn ' t him , either . who is he , i wonder . not , i gather , the world ' s greatest living expert on <person> and <person> , but someone else entirely . will you be you be mean to him too ? will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly , miraculously , like a bolt from the blue , find that sharp little tongue of yours ?
no , i won ' t . because the man who ' s coming here tonight is completely unlike you . the man who is coming here is kind and funny -- he has the most wonderful sense of humor --
no , it was a good thing . i mean , good in that it was very quick .
oh . so . what brings you down here ?
call me , if you ' d like to see some of my other pieces .
i ' d like that .
i didn ' t think so . <continued_utterance> boo ! you see , i can ' t even scare a crow ! they come from miles . mcu -- <person> listening -- scarecrow o . s . <continued_utterance> oh , i ' m a failure , because i haven ' t got a brain . mcu -- <person> reacts , speaks --
well , what would you do with a brain if you had one ?
maybe he got promoted . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t . touch . anything .
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we ' re talking spring break !
i ' m busy .
<person> ' t make me raise my hand to you . you have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction .
he say he know you killing him .
now how ' d he figure that out ?
see her ?
there ' s a beautiful , whoa , a very beautiful girl .
what does that mean ?
and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think i would hurt <person> ? ! she ' s the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ?
we were told the building was clear .
you ' ll get your turn , <person> . please step out .
enjoy the rest of your life .
i ' ll meet you on the boat , south of <person> .
you know , this is one bad stretch of road . all kinds of trouble going on up here : kids drag racing . niggers hauling booze across the state lines . <person> drivers breaking down , no-one ever hears from them again .
we just want to get out of here , so if you could just- she holds out the money , but he ignores it .
hi , <person> .
what the hell do you think you ' re doing . ? what ' s going on here . ?
you ' re sure you ' re alright , sir ?
yes , i ' m quite alright . <person> then . goodbye , sir . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> .
you ' ll miss it , i ' m afraid .
i ' ll try my best to be on time .
well , you will be safe here , i can assure you of that . i will contact <person> right away and have them send some people to come and collect you .
<person> , no , don ' t . you mustn ' t let anybody know we ' re here unless you have to . i can ' t be sure that <person> is completely safe for me .
well , it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart -- or that you ' re going on a long sea voyage !
how did you become high priest ?
maybe i do .
maybe i don ' t need your ideas . maybe i can do better on my own . <continued_utterance> you got no reason to do that !
i got one up on ya .
go ahead .
and he can hear a cricket passing gas in niffelheim .
<person> not ! he heareth all !
<person> does this to me and lives !
how do ya like your eggs ? over easy ? side of tomatoes ?
since i haven ' t been able to find <person> since coming back , you ' re going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean ?
<person> . i love her .
i got things to do . blind man oh well , go do ' em . you don ' t see me stopping you .
. but ain ' t you got a little something for the infirm ?
still playing ?
that ' s not an answer . what is it you want ?
and where would you and your beer-bellied architect be leaving to ?
i don ' t know . the super bowl , new orleans jazz festival . maybe a couple months in nepal .
second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein .
wan na see my hickey from <person> december ?
and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think i would hurt <person> ? ! she ' s the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ?
i don ' t know .
i have no plans to die today .
none do .
yes . he came to discuss our friendship . i told him now was not the time .
so where is <person> now ?
things change . now i ' m taking off my clothes . all by myself . <continued_utterance> well ?
you have changed since second grade .
<person> ?
nope . jbj .
my guess is there isn ' t enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring , but we should do a blowup of this anyway .
may i see the magnifying glass , <person> ? there doesn ' t seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring .
<person> , she ' s been like this all day . i don ' t know . she must have eaten something . she did her business and it was kind of . watery .
her stool ? did you look at it for parasites ?
thank you , your honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana , u . s . <number> point <number> and <number> through <number> of the uniform code : ' the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' and , your honor , having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the xerox form .
. one moment , mr . concannon .
thats just what she said . i had a boner with a capital o . i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway . i found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines . she was a wild chick . she was wearin bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides . you know , them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg ?
you mean like pedal pushers ?
no , ted . this is an actual emergency . <continued_utterance> i tried to warn you , <person> . she ' s got stiletto heels hidden in those keds .
but you triple-dog-dared me .
oh . oh , that ' s good .
but we ' re not on my planet , are we ?
it feels right because you ' re here and because you ' re leaving .
you ' ve given me a great gift , doctor . the gift of life . you ' re a great man .
yes , sir .
you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose .
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?
she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .
do you know what you ' re doin ' ? just get outta here !
you know what , man ? you ' re still a fuckin ' asshole .
does <person> know ? what have you done to us ?
we ' re going to ringling . me , <person> . you can too .
<person> for the fanatics ? what does that mean ?
well , you know . they ' re all coming out of the woodwork now .
i know what he said .
you can go with <person> . he ' s taking <person> to school . but you ' ll have to hurry .
what are you going to do with her ?
<person> is a beautiful girl , with an extraordinary power . one that even
no .
yes .
they just said that to put us off guard . they saw the condition this apartment ' s in . <continued_utterance> they know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn ' t find it . so that means we ' ve still got it .
but he said the investigation was closed .
you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of --
oh just shoot us already . i ' m sorry i asked .
why are you lying like this ?
no , <person> . it ' s true . you work for e . i . o . so do i .
you remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like <person> . and your teacher , <person> said , `` you ' re too late , <person> . there ' s nothing left to explore . `` and all the other kids laughed .
how do you know about that ?
i suppose that ' s a possibility . that ' s what i tell my statistics class anyway ; life is a game of chance . endless possibilities and permutations . you just have to calculate the odds .
you haven ' t answered the question .
i mean , i realize i ' m in no position to , uh , basically say anything , ever -- but it ' s not like i ' m down there in some redneck bar in florida having an argument with some stripper ' s boyfriend and i suddenly think , `` hey ! maybe this ' d be a good time to really stick it to <person> and get myself locked up for a few months . ``
i ' m sorry .
what about him ? i told him i don ' t train with people i don ' t know .
ah , the devil you know .
<person> , it was over a year ago .
what ' s wrong with me ?
yes !
you reached down into death . now , isn ' t that right ?
i ' d go to australia . lot of land , not many people . i think after this i ' d like to quit people for awhile . and the girls go crazy for brothers down there .
really ?
wherever it was , you can ' t be doing it , alright ? i mean this is a serious -- shit , he ' s here . <continued_utterance> this is a serious problem . <continued_utterance> guy hasn ' t been inside a school since <number> - <number> .
what are we gon na do ?
that ' s all right . i got it .
it ' s just new drapes and curtain rods . if i had known it was going to be so heavy i would have had them delivered up to the house . <continued_utterance> i just got tired of looking at the old drapes . my mother made them . had them long as i can remember . you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ? bobby yes , i have . <continued_utterance> ' course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i don ' t hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things . bobby i . can ' t . argue . <continued_utterance> this is it . <continued_utterance> thank you , <person> .
we been seein ' you all along the way .
yeah . i been seein ' you , too .
yes , sir . perhaps i can keep my brother here with me , he ' s also very good with horses .
oh no no . not necessary . <continued_utterance> get moving . we leave tonight .
that wasn ' t him . i heard him tell the cops .
no -- <person> -- that was him . but that was him . i wish it wasn ' t , but it was .
it ' s mrs . it ' s <person> . spencer . from next door . is everything --
you ' re the flower lady .
not worth worrying about . mostly descendants of the original colonists from earth . now they want self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals . i don ' t think we ' ve met . you with our group ? takes me a while to know everyone .
sure . <person> .
this is stupid . it ' s going on a month now . how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards ? they can bomb them all they want , <person> ain ' t going anywhere without a ground assault .
why you in such a hurry to get to shooting ?
yes , <person> ?
was that the matron ?
yeah ?
is there anything you want to ask me , about your father ?
my son is out there !
<person> ' s going to hurt your son .
<person> ' t start , alright .
<person> . why so pissed ?
i think i ' ll just lie down awhile <continued_utterance> long as i live i ' ll never <person> used to that sound .
they ' re just lonely is all . <person> , i howl myself sometimes .
stay calm , everyone ! ! <continued_utterance> uh , meeting adjourned .
oh , boy . <person> ya take a look at all those presents ? !
so what ' s your angle ?
<person> . <person> secret .
<person> ? what ?
there ' s a cop on the doorstep . he didn ' t see you . he mustn ' t see you . we ' re in deep trouble , <person> .
you ' ve been very kind . i ' ve been far less grateful than you deserve .
i also hit you with my car a couple times , so it kind of evens out .
came from redfoot .
right .
we ' re here to take you home .
you know i can ' t . my father is dead because of me . i must remain in exile . the other asgardians exchange puzzled looks .
it ' s always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i ' d better . take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
but .
<person> . if that ' s the case , then i ' ll buy you one more drink , and you ' ll leave town tonight .
i had it all backwards . i had it all wrong .
who was that ?
a friend from school .
something before take-off ?
oooowww ! ! that hurt . you biii -- she slumps . <person> looks at <person> .
relax , will you . <continued_utterance> i diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing !
i told the cops we were taking care of her . you realize we ' re now stuck with the kid till <person>
embarrassment ? !
it ' s perfectly natural for a patient to bond with his analyst . it ' s a normal part of therapy . if you want to be rid of him , simply take him back where you got him and go home .
how will we know what to do ?
even a child would know what to do .
i know what i did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much i want that gold .
it ' s all right . i don ' t like it , but it ' s over now .
look ! <continued_utterance> what do we do ?
we keep going , that ' s what we do . we ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
got any requests ?
that country shit all sounds the same to me .
is it true what you said . on the show tonight ? about letting him go if he wanted it badly enough . would you really do that ?
it won ' t come to that .
call it penance .
i thought that ' s what <person> was-
you underestimate me , romes .
it ' s a bad habit i picked up from knowing you so long .
and that there ' s a time in life to play it safe .
that ' s great , <person> . and i ' m learning how to listen to the tuning fork , throw caution to the wind , and take crazy risks i never thought were possible .
how so ?
let ' s look at it this way , what if i can sell you this job at a wholesale price . kind of lessens the burden . the big boss won ' t get so angry , and maybe won ' t throw the guy ' s wife and kids out . at least they ' ll have a roof over their heads .
<person> ' s texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if i want an antique sewing table that we bought together .
do you ?
that guy was hurtin ' me . and if you hadn ' t come out when you did , he ' d a hurt me a lot worse . and probably nothin ' woulda happened to him . ' <person> everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night . and they woulda made out like i asked for it . and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now . at least now i ' m havin ' fun . and i ' m not sorry the son of a bitch is dead . i ' m only sorry that it was you that did it and not me . and if i haven ' t , i wan na take this time to thank you , <person> . thank you for savin ' my ass .
i said all that ?
ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know . we ' re fine .
well , i ' m glad . <person> my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know .
saturday .
you ' ll be there .
i can still read .
your wife wants you to come home . she ' s concerned . i ' m concerned . this life on a boat . where is it getting you ?
<person> ' s on campus , being the good soldier for wordfest . but he ' s a basket case . someone stole <person> ' s jacket last night . and <person> ' s missing , too .
i-heard .
you lead an exciting life , mr .
not usually .
my bike . it ' s back over there . we ' ll hang soon . bring your mask if you want . i ' m getting used to it .
wait a minute .
now that you mention it , they might have been a little bit jumpy .
you know what ? you ' re starting to irritate me .
let me tell you something about <person> ' s father , and your ' s too . how do you think you got here ? you think this is all free , that they owe you something ? you think they enjoy riding subways and commuter trains , driving buses or pulling lobster traps ? work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school ? look around at how the rest of the world lives <person> . we ' re the luckiest people alive , every one of us . they gave it up for you and <person> , and me too my friend . <continued_utterance> there are ground rules in families just like on this boat . if you and <person> don ' t like it , i ' m sorry . someday you ' ll understand that , and if you ' re lucky , you ' ll come home and find your best friend has been there all along waiting for you to forgive him for being a father . it ' ll be the way it used to be , when you were ten and your dad was a giant . <continued_utterance> does <person> know how you guys feel ?
i don ' t know .
sold .
no doubt close to the dog ' s actual value .
but he wants to live at home .
i know , pal . <person> on a minute . <person> ? yes . this is him . <continued_utterance> oh . can you hang for a moment ? <continued_utterance> hey , i have to take this . i ' ll be right in , ok ? we can talk in a minute . <continued_utterance> hi . <person> to keep you waiting .
<person> ' s clean , let ' s go .
you been the one making it rain like that , out there , <person> ?
she retained me last week to help sort out her father ' s situation .
last week ? i thought she just arrived two days ago . <continued_utterance> how long have you been here ?
no i ' m not .
you ' re not ? !
i saw a movie once . part of it took place in heaven . everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses . like that . at least that ' s the way i remember it . abruptly , <person> glances at his watch . <continued_utterance> i should be going .
<person> . <person> ' t leave just yet . there ' s something i think you ought to see .
<person> ' t they tell you ? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak . you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass , man .
<person> feels like it . ted grimaces and shifts in his seat . ted how the hell did you get here anyway ?
i changed my room at the hotel .
why ?
hundred-fifty .
to replace a goddamn radiator hose ! ?
my name is <person> , czech secret police . when you are here you are under my jurisdiction , you take my orders , you do what i say . if you become any kind of an inconvenience , i ' ll shoot you .
here we go again .
what ? i thought <person> was dead . i thought it was verified .
apparently not . <person> , it ' s a shit storm here right now . when are you coming back ? i don ' t know what to tell people any more .
when i see an opening .
that path she was talking about winds through these falls . what do you think ?
of course it matters . hey , hold on !
what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .
<person> and <person> don ' t think so .
<person> ' s happy because he wants to be state attorney general and his most likely opponent will be welles <person> . <person> ' s happy because <person> , who ' s leading their city council race , is endorsed by <person> . thus , they ' re not seeing the larger play . <person> ' s new target will likely be the lapd itself .
look at this finger here .
leland .
the precursor of science fact .
in some cases .
what does <person> say ?
he wants to be me . or he will kill me .
and when might that be ?
now .
love .
yes .
her doctors murdered her . they gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life . her doctors murdered her .
do you know who her doctors were ?
really ?
that ' s what i hear . <person> ' t matter . girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .
oh , right , a snap to find the one single person in the world who fills your heart with joy .
<person> ' t be ridiculous . have i ever been with anyone who fits that description ?
he ' s got nothin ' to gain by lyin ' . <person> ' at all . he already got all their money . i just don ' t know what we ' re dealin ' with here . <person> , it went out again last night on nationwide teletype . <person> ' s just wait it out a little longer . she said she was gon na call back . <person> ' s just sit tight .
we don ' t have a whole lotta choice , do we ? i can ' t figure out if they ' re real smart or just really , really lucky .
<person> .
do you need some money ?
what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in `` heaven ? ''
matter of fact , <person> , my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of `` beauty . ``
howd she sound ? was she doin okay ?
could she be doin okay , <person> ? shes tryin to prove somethin to me , thats all . <person> aint doin no moren showin off , defyin me . <person> , <person> done somethin bad .
the wizard ? the wizard ? i -- can ' t -- well -- yes , of course . but first i ' ll take you to a little place where you can .
oh , thank you so much . we ' ve been gone such a long time , and we feel so mess -- what kind of a horse is that ? i ' ve never seen a horse like that before !
<person> , i am .
<person> , good . get some sleep , did you ?
so they took care of <person> .
<person> to the water . the river keeps goin ' down then rising again .
i did .
why ?
no ! stop ! get off me right now !
if not for me , do it for democracy .
i ' ve never been more popular .
<person> , we need help .
this cup of turpentine right here . go for that gun in your purse and i ' m gon na let you have it .
oh , mr , <person> , please . you ' re my only hope . <continued_utterance> i ' m weak . you ' re strong . <person> ' t you find a place somewhere in your heart to help me ?
yes , sir .
all stop on the engine .
i ' ll get there as soon as i can .
if we ' re moving the press conference , we need to do it now . are you all right ?
happens all the time , man . they ' re falling out of the skies like flies . government knows all about it . chariots of the gods , man . they practically own south america . i mean they taught the incas everything they knew .
cool it , palmer ! !
anything you hurl them at will turn to stone .
they ' re magic ? are you serious ?
can you get him out of it , <person> ?
if i can find whoever wanted to kill <person> bad enough to get this .
then why didn ' t you just nudge me a bit and tell me to go and sleep on the other side ?
i didn ' t want to wake you up . i thought you might think it was kind of stupid or something .
after we ' ve completed our investigation .
that ' s a nice suit .
i will be the judge of that .
no ! they will be the judge of that ! and so will i . if you shame me !
i bet you a hundred .
<person> , good . puts things back in perspective .
and what did your team do .
well , we .
<person> , <person> -- guess who ? that ' s right , and you know everyday i say to myself , today could be the day . so what do you say . will you marry me ? then please can you get me through to mr . <person> ?
it concerns his future !
i need an introduction to the obregon brothers .
i can ' t do that .
no , i ' m not comfortable !
wait a -- hey ! <continued_utterance> <person> him down . that ' s right . just lay him out . lay him right out . <person> . <person> out his knees .
big is the key word , and im telling you i want it bad .
i want you to get rid of <person> .
<person> !
got some boys workin ' around those rocks behind you . another minute or two , gon na have you in a crossfire ! how do you like that ?
you know better than this , <person> . dr . <person> is covering for me .
i told him that , <person> , but he insists on talking to you . he says it ' s an emergency .
where ' s the body ?
the swamp , most likely . <person> ' s a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he ' s made a mistake .
yeah .
it shouldn ' t have . but it did .
hey <person> , tell <person> what you were telling me last night .
the professor -- <person> walks towards her .
well , that ' s what we ' re here for . <continued_utterance> whether you imagined it or not , you actually saw and heard things that frightened you . that gave you reason for concern .
yes , but .
they are better off disbanded .
your eminence , i ' ve been hearing some very troubling rumors about you .
yes , i think . he keeps talking about marriage , keeps saying he wants to meet <person> .
well , that ' s it -- three dates and you got ' im good .
no you mean . ?
uh-huh .
no , i saw you eat the forbidden fruit .
oh , that ! yeah ! i did eat the fruit . i was just kidding about humping maya .
that is not an `` option . `` there is no multiple choice here .
yes sir , there sure is an option here . there are always options .
i was as sorry as anyone to hear about mr . <person> ' s passing . wished he coulda ' lived to see this !
what are you talking about ?
uh huh . want me to lose them ?
no . we need this lead . unit seven .
she did it .
we don ' t know that for sure .
<person> ? <person> they need these signed by the end of the business day .
i walked and i kept on walking . it ' s a strange feeling becoming an orphan the same time you ' re becoming a man . to have this freedom to be anything you want at the same time everything you were is taken away . so i just walked . then all of a sudden , i stopped .
how so ?
i went to see <person> about the divorce . <continued_utterance> he was not too agreeable , and one thing led to another , and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter .
not to worry . they way they set things up , you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection .
then why the clean overalls ?
i know , i know .
i know it ' s not practical --
two kids could ' ve gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .
those are <person> ' s teeth .
i caught you .
brian ! come in here !
i ' ll call them from the road .
do you love me ?
why ?
i don ' t know . he doesn ' t talk much . he ' s kind of a weird kid . why can ' t i have one kid like that on my team ? just one .
easy <person> .
he must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . before the clock runs out .
are you refusing to come peaceably ?
probably . but i ' ll leave it up to my companions . <person> ?
just because you ' re nervous about tomorrow , <person> , doesn ' t give you the right to get snippy . if you can ' t handle the pressure , postpone the interview .
<person> , it ' s not the interview -- i mean i am nervous about it -- but that ' s not what ' s bugging me . it ' s . him .
when will i see you again ?
never . <continued_utterance> good-bye , frank .
i can ' t .
what ' s stopping you ?
i ' ve done a few things but i ' m not a murderer , mr . mckenna .
how do you know if you ' ve never tried ?
youre perfect for me , too .
you remind me of my daddy , you know ? <person> told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies . he had a long nose , too , like theirs . did i ever tell you how he died ?
<person> ! <person> mio ! i can ' t believe it ! how are you ?
good good . how you doin ' ?
<person> good , senora <person> . welcome to the danieli . you are in the doge ' s -- our premiere suite . is there anything special you require ?
have a copy of today ' s <person> sent up to the room please .
<person> ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable . a smear on the drafting board .
<person> , everybody thought so . but me and <person> got a kick out of <person>s . all <person>s . we couldn ' t see the bad in ' em . and when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the first national bank of <person>town , we took his case . but when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . we went to his house to take him in . but he was wise .
who told you that ? i ' m just a marketing trainee . my clinic master thought i ' d learn something about marketing if i moonlighted as a security guard on one of your test previews .
<person> . i ' m marked for death and they send me on the road with a pr nerd .
this was the part of the proposal that intrigued us , but i ' m not sure i follow .
<person> ' s say for example -
may i carry your package , <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> .
you sure you can manage ?
i ' m ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .
i know . i ' m <person> . <person> .
you didn ' t get here in time . my game is dead .
no , just your pod . i replicated the entire contents of your pod when i fixed your nerve boards . they ' re in safe-keeping . they ' re all in one piece .
thats disgustin . those kinda sentiments should not be allowed out in public . is this <person> yet ?
almost . i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat .
<person> , right .
some guy really screwed her - screwed her up real good . some earthman . <person> hopped on a space shuttle .
forget it , just the coffee .
<person> ?
i wouldn ' t know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
you don ' t have to imagine it . not anymore . now all you ' ve got to think up is what it ' s going to buy you .
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?
how many deaths is he responsible for ? how many innocent people ? you may only get one shot at a man like <person> . same circumstances , i ' d do the same again . <continued_utterance> we sent <number> down to kill him . before he could , <person> escaped . a week later our man caught up with the target . put a bullet in his head . that bullet is still there .
<person> ' t snap at them !
they ' re driving me nuts !
to cover you or the war ?
to cover everything . <continued_utterance> no . <continued_utterance> for godsakes , russell , listen .
dr . m , you have a fam ! <continued_utterance> you know , i ' m beginning to think you ' re an ingrate .
what ? !
a which ?
you know , <person>eric-fucking-chopin .
because i say so , <person> . please don ' t think it ' s the way i want it . it ' s just that <person> ' s not himself .
it ' s not <person> ' s fault .
i ' m not bait . no way . i post today .
you posted twenty minutes ago . <person> wants you out of here a . s . a . p . , unless you turn state ' s .
i think it is .
would you like to know how i handle a situation like that . ?
a woman can have the same effect .
what do i do ?
general mcaddie ' s .
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here . we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately .
oh , lance ! you ' re wonderful ! how can i possibly repay you ?
i ' ll think of something , estelle . <continued_utterance> now the kid better not be here when the detectives start coming around . i ' d send him away for a while . a long while .
only if you are a good man , a friend . are you a friend ?
like that boy next door playing that his horn . if he was a friend , he would stop irritating people , but if he stops practicing , he wouldn ' t be perfect in what he does someday .
you don ' t know no shrinks .
i know one .
i guess there ' s probably a story behind that .
there is , but it ' s not that interesting .
so did <person> . she ' s in it too .
sounds like a good one .
so where you headed anyway ?
dr . <person> ' s office . my parents are making me see a shrink now .
hes the kind liked it .
<person> , i got to get some sleep .
oh , no ! are things that bad ?
we ' re using the ski-tow to hang the wash on . you ' re not going to stay either , are you ?
do you think <person> ' s having an affair ?
i don ' t think <person> is mature enough to conduct an affair .
what ?
you telling me you didn ' t know this was the guy ?
andlt ; andlt ; you ' ll be alright . he is from the f . b . i . he is here to help you . he wants to know what happened in the harbor . andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; we were there to buy a man and take him back to hungary . andgt ; andgt ;
my baby here took a huge hit in the church , <person> . you see how she ' s quivering ?
it . she , yes , she ' s quivering .
come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
i don ' t know . this is bad .
so you ' ve given up .
her doctors have . <person> and i .
where are we ?
therapy land , <person> . a twentieth century theme park of the mind . <continued_utterance> the lines look short today .
yeah , dad .
you know you can always talk to me . right ? whatever is going on in your life , your mom and i ' ll understand .
you wanted to talk ?
yeah , kinda , wanted to see if you ' d join back up with us .
i ' m guessing no .
<person> , i guess you ' re right .
what do you mean ?
no engine . no heat .
i ' m just goin ' to see <person> at dawson ' s .
can i walk with you a little ?
that ' s why you married us ? so we could conceive our child in wedlock ? the fucking joke ' s on you . i ' m already pregnant . eight weeks yesterday . <person> and ida stare disbelievingly at sheryl .
you ' re lying .
yeah ?
i think you oughta read it to her .
i ' m involved somehow with e . i . o . it ' s true . it ' s no fantasy .
<person> , i want you to see a doctor . now <person> and <person> have a good man . he helped <person> through his breakdown .
evidence of a massive infection .
what kind of infection ?
yes . ?
i hope you are comfortable here , inside my kingdom .
i just saw her .
in new york ?
august , please . we ' re in public .
ah , nothing to be ashamed of . <person> and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places .
what can it hurt to talk to someone ? <continued_utterance> please . <continued_utterance> you promised . <continued_utterance> <person> , she ' s been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you weren ' t thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .
i never said i wasn ' t upset . of course i ' m upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard . and it wasn ' t some `` symptom '' of something .
why ?
i figure a guy who ' s made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who ' s made some of her own .
and just look at my face ! <person> ' s going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks . and what ' ll happen to me if they don ' t want me anymore ?
but you ' re beautiful -- at your age all you need is a good night ' s sleep and you ' ll look like new .
just sitting here , it feels completely unreal . i ' m sure you knew that would happen .
you ' re stuck now , aren ' t you ? you want to go back to the chinese restaurant because there ' s nothing happening here . we ' re safe . it ' s boring .
that ' s great . i ' ll just tell my creditors i ' m not a rapist . no problem . <person> . i can ' t believe the board ' s going to act without even hearing my side of it .
the van ryan family created <person> . they built the school . <person> calls up the board and says kiss my ass , they say , left , right , or in the middle . you ' re gon na need some help on this one , <person> . you ' re gon na need a lawyer , and he ' d better be a good one .
forget it . i have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope .
i ' m sure the dope was in the diaper .
you weren ' t there , you don ' t know what happened .
i know enough .
. <person> ' t you see . ? if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth . nothing could stop it ! nothing !
<person> , maybe you ' re right about this . but we ' ve got to be rational . we ' ve got to talk this over . i ' m unarmed and i ' m coming in .
of course , i ' m always happy . unless i ' m bored . that blonde <person> , is that your wife ?
what about her ?
<person> .
uh-uh . starts with an `` i '' .
what ?
give me a slap . across the face .
nothing , he ' s just been sort of , i don ' t know . . kidnapped .
<person> ? by who ?
we ' ll take care of you .
<person> , she ' s right here , leland . it ' s for you . it ' s your father .
get this area policed up . no telling who might be dropping in .
yes , sir !
your first step , sir , will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within <number> to <number> hours . they will refuse . when they do , you will order the strikes , followed by the invasion . they will resist , but will be overrun . they will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world , most likely <person> . we will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there , defeating them per our plans .
those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons . and what is the next step ?
. i made a reservation at .
. apartment . no , no . <person> . you don ' t know who we ' re dealing with , i , please believe me , they .
who ?
this is your last chance , you fuck . now either you come clean or i ' m going to kick your ass from here to tallahassee .
they ?
yeah . my assassins . they ' d want to have a little talk with you about where i am .
sure . just chisel some off your heart .
so cute . he shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife .
i ' ll give you a grand to locate and tail <person> .
your partner ?
<person> planned it for <person> day just to tick me off .
thirty dollars and sixty nine cents
you want to crawl , crawl .
you ' re going to blow yourselves up .
then you get us out of here .
i will ! but i need help !
eventually you ' ll let go .
and then what ?
where are you going to go , <person> ? you gon na run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know they ' ll get you out there .
maybe so , but i ' m no rat , <person> . you tricked me , that ' s all . i won ' t keep my mouth shut ' cause i ' m scared . i ' <number> keep it shut ' cause i let <person> down by getting caught - <person> too . and if they kill me , it ' s
i don ' t know .
if she was dangerous before --
of course , i don ' t know , but i think it ' ll get darker before it gets lighter .
do -- do you suppose we ' ll meet any wild animals ?
you ' re not a team player .
<person> ' t point at me .
was she the nanny ? i forgot that . how ironic . then there was the ice skater --
-- also the nanny --
oh , i don ' t know . i think proms are pretty dumb .
' <person> thought maybe you and i could go if you weren ' t already taking someone .
ever since i can remember .
on the other hand , you ' re making strides . you got here .
i think this place may be a little too large for us .
what are you talking about . this match box ?
i am <person> .
in one minute i ' m going to call the police --
i don ' t want you to be sorry , i just want you to stop it !
i will ! i will ! i ' m stopping , i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> <person> ? i ' m stopping ! i ' m not doing it . <person> ? i ' m not .

<person> to me carefully . i saw one of their meetings . it was above a convenience store .
who ' s meeting ? where have you been ?

i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government . the daily newspaper .
forty minutes ?
that ' s right .
his wife .
his wife ? good . bring them .
you ' re serious ?
i just won an event the other night .

and then we would never have been at war .
you ' re right . it ' s not a joke . <person> , i know a little about the amish . i know this has to be an ordeal for you ; and i ' m really sorry you an <person> got involved . <continued_utterance> what was that ?
he wants to know who you are . your name . i told him we don ' t need to know anything about you .
<person> , check out <person> , it ' s still not over .
<person> .

certainly my secretary told you . as of this afternoon , i ' m on vacation with my family until <person> day .
<person> to bother you in a meeting , but you have to promise me that you ' ll be home at eight . i don ' t want <person> and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year .

this is a complicated matter , <person> , affecting both france and the crown . <continued_utterance> and so , until such time as i and my advisors -- -- can determine the whole truth of the matter . i invite you to await our decision in the comfort of . the bastille .
you can ' t do this to me . i ' m the cardinal of france .
i can see this stunt really has liberated your mind .
i ' m telling you , <person> : killing myself was the best thing that ever happened to me .
i could give a shit . i just want to this case to get a quick burial .

you killed one of the cardinal ' s guards . an offense punishable by death .
he interrupted a duel i was fighting .
that ' s right , <person> . i guess you ' re saying there ' s an awful lot of trails for us to cover .

this is about sex , not like . <person> , <person> ' s here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins . you want a muffin ?
for my sin the ground is cursed . thorns and thistles does it sprout for us , and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives . for as the lord has commanded , by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken . for dust you are , and to dust shall you return .
wow . that ' s kind of a downer isn ' t it ?

she ' s in love with me . i ' ve got to get some water in the pool . and once a week i have lunch with president <person> to discuss security measures against the sandinista insurgents , but all he wants to talk about is <person> . he ' s worried about her .

you like ice cream ?
yes .
yes , it is him . <continued_utterance> <person> , yes , operator , i accept the charges .
would you mind very much if i listened ?
if your jupiter missiles in turkey were removed also , such an accommodation could be reached . <continued_utterance> you want war .
however , while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue , the united states can offer a private assurance . <continued_utterance> our jupiter missiles in turkey are obsolete , and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time . this withdrawal should be completed within , say , six months . <continued_utterance> of course , any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government .
silence !
ohhh -- jiminy crickets ! els -- throne --
he okay ?
healthy as can be .
oh . goodness .
you ' re free . you can do anything you ever wanted to do !
<person> , this guy owes me a big one . a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office ; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven ' t all done that . <person> , they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk .
his mother ?
no . just down the street , the amigo tower .
i ' m sorry , i ' m not familiar with it . what style ?

<person> , i don ' t think i should .
<person> ! ! stupid <person> ! i ' ll kill ya ! let me out !
if it was a dope deal , where ' s the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ?
and i am sure you have a host of wild + theories to answer these questions .
what hope is there for <person> ?
there ' s always a purpose to everything your father does . <person> may yet find a way home .
i tell you , i feel like a ghost .
<person> , would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom . my hand is too weak . and would you do me another favor ? i don ' t like asking this but would you clean the tub for me ? i have trouble bending over .
a car accident .
now you ' re going to have to tell me more .
he knows .
you sound so sure .
i saw him .
sure you did , bro . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
you know we ' re going to be rich . admit it . you know . come on , admit it . in spite of himself wes gives a little smile .
<person> , there it is . there it is . you know it .
you mean it ' s been moved ?
i mean the musketeers have been disbanded . <person> free to poke around for souvenirs .
it ' s going .
i was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee .
<person> is a cokehead . hand of god , my ass . we ' re wasting our time here .
he won . he was a winner . that bothers you .
<person> shit .
tell me about it . i got ta be honest , <person> , it ' s not a good time for me . my business is off and my step son wants to get <person> .
well , we ' re fbi agents .
you ' re not fbi agents .
who ' s that ?
no idea .
no matter . he ' ll have to know how close we came .
<person> or not , if <person> ' s alive he ' ll never come up again .
i came here to apologize .
for what ?
can i turn on the radio ?
sure , if you like rocking out to kfrm , `` all agriculture , all the time . ``
no way . not <person> .
<person> . <person> . de-nail ain ' t just a river in egypt . she ' s probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion .
my ride . ? well , i . i ' m not sure .
forgive me .
why <person> ?
he was working on a test . <person> must have been onto something . these bastards got scared and got rid of him . . hey . where ' s .
i never said that . i ' m saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys . besides , your brother <person> never gave a shit about you . ted gives him a look . dom you know , you ' re a real glass-is-half-empty guy . you got a fucking guardian angel , man .
i got ta take this , it might be my boss . ted here . <continued_utterance> yep .
did she want to talk to me or anything ?
no .
<person> , you still got it , <person> . who ' s mr . jocularity ?
that ' s <person> , the gag king .
little white christmas lights that twinkle . i use them in my window and on all my displays , as if you didn ' t notice .
<person> , the reason i came into your store is that i was spending the day with <person> and <person> . i like to buy them a present when i see them because i ' m one of those guys who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relatives . there was only one place to buy children ' s books in the neighborhood -- although that will not always be the case , and it was yours , and it is a charming little bookstore . you probably sell $ <number> , <number> worth of book a year --
my job . back off , benedict . <continued_utterance> the only man i called `` dad '' owns a little grocery store in xenia , ohio . he learned a lot of cool stuff from my <person> , who was a peach farmer in his day . <person> knew the right thing to say in every situation , and it usually involved peaches . my dad ' s a lot like him . and he taught me , you have to focus on the peachy side of life , not the pits . <continued_utterance> there was a time when canned peaches were the hottest , greatest thing ever invented . it was like a little taste of summer , anytime you wanted . grocery stores couldn ' t keep them in stock , they were so popular . and even though other canned fruits like pears , plums , and pineapples have come along , people still need to know they can get their canned peaches , on the same shelf , whenever they want them . it ' s comforting , you know ? it fulfills their expectations . <continued_utterance> you ' re probably wondering if there ' s a point to all this and i guess it ' s just that i goofed last month . i not only moved the canned peaches , i restocked the shelves with kiwi , guava , and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup . i challenged people ' s expectations . and you can ' t do that to your customers . so , i ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches . <continued_utterance> thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
that ' s a nasty cut you got there .
<person> , fell down and hit a rock . not as bad as it looks .
you got me .
i love you , <person> .
i said all that ?
no , <person> , you said the first part . i said all the rest .
take both men into custody before <person> and the feds could , and find out what they were going to tell-
-and why did i choose you for this ?
<number> . <number> . <person> more will get you back .
<person>-seven , fifty . that ' s all i got .
oh .
i knew it wasn ' t possible . what can i say ? sometimes a person just wants the impossible . could i ask you something ?
it ' s me .
<person> ! where the hell have you been ?
no , <person> , i ' m speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say .
in that case , we should go to the canyon trailer park .
do you think i should ?
the shop around the corner is a true new york treasure .
you don ' t have to do that .
i know .
it ' s going to cost you two-hundred dollars .
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty .
well . it ' s an interesting problem . but i don ' t really know what to tell you . it ' s a little outside my personal field of expertise .
all right .
you ' re god damn right it ' s not . you take that picture you ' ll take it for all the right reasons -- i understand .
i ' m not gon na take it .
oh ? <person> taking good care of you ?

i don ' t know how to even tell you this without being embarrassed for myself . it was an accident . it ' s like one of those things out of the blue . it ' s crazy . you can ' t explain it . it happens .
thank you , brother . you see this beast ? <person> ?
amazing , man .
i steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !
i got him ! you see that , i nailed him !
they call me mr . <person> at school . cause i break like glass . <person> ' s face is tense . unyielding . <person> .
. you make this decision now to be afraid . and you ' ll never turn back your whole life . you ' ll always be afraid . <continued_utterance> . i got a present for you .
i ' m finished at three . no . <person> with <person> .
after that .
he ' s killed closer .
you are seriously deranged .
what ' s real to you ? wall street ? capital hill ? now they are myths .
i can ' t be dicking around here . that ' s all i ' m saying . i don ' t carry crystals , i don ' t wan na come back in another life . i just wan na do my job , and do it right , and get the fuck outta here .
<person> , we need help .
you ' re right . i ' ve got to get this pod fixed .
so why ' d you move him if he wanted to stay here .
because it would have been too much work to leave him here . i couldn ' t have done it .
<person> ' t surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
it ' s not a joke .
i ' m sorry ?
i know how hard it can be sometimes .
fifty-seven , fifty-eight --
just listen to what <person> did to <person> ! she --
it ' s the truth . why won ' t you believe it ?
cause i don ' t take <person> . i don ' t know what you ' re up to , lady , but i ' m gon na nail you for the acme murder .
forget <person> .
we can ' t just leave him .
where ?
away from here .
that explains the emptiness that haunts me .
<person> is so unattractive .
why is it every time you choose to speak , it has to be something dark and ominous ?
a master of magic could easily bring three jotuns into <person> .
<person> ? <person> ' t you want the name of the housing project ?
uh , that ' s okay .
you be careful now , <person> .
<person> of a bitch !
. you got your doctor ' s testimony . why do you need me ?
i want someone who was in the o . r . we ' re going to win the case , there ' s no question of that . it ' s just a matter of how big .
maybe . met a guy named <person> , owns a garage , could have some work in about a week . met a few hard luck boys whos stayin here . whats that smell ?
i barfed . <person> to make it to the bathroom . <person> out it was the wrong door anyways . i sorta got it cleaned up .
<person> , <person> , don ' t do anything stupid . you couldn ' t get within a mile of schaeffer right now . so stay put . stay in touch i ' ll let you know when maybe it makes sense . <continued_utterance> you hear me ?
i hear you . i ' ll stay in touch .
how much are your paying ?
whatever it costs , it won ' t be as much as this exquisite mohair episode . we ' re also going to have a section on west side writers --
well , certainly we ' ll reimburse you .
that ' s not necessary . i just felt . . it might be good for <person> to be with his family this weekend .
someone else has it now .
that would indicate that it ' s the future .
i don ' t know if we could take one in with <person> and me at home alone at times .
oh , i wasn ' t pointing my finger at you . hey , you have to think of yourself . a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep . there are too many bad people out there .
did they hurtcha ?
lion , darling -- i knew you ' d come !
it won ' t change anything for me .
<person> , i won ' t play this game . i won ' t feel sorry for you .
well that ' s what i ' m trying to figure out . how long have you known him ?
not long at all , but i really like him . <person> , i know he ' s a little different , tucker , but that ' s what i like about him . he ' s a guy . a real guy . he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn ' t always politically correct and he probably farts , too . and that ' s okay with me .
no . that lady is gone and doesn ' t want to be found .
<person> .
no . it is the beginning . the world will never be the same .
it will be yours , and yours alone . <person> fun with it .
i have . i did . it ' s done .

aaaaaahhhh . <person> . here , i made something for the baby .
what ' s inside ?
i say to myself , look at the map . look what ' s all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they ' d throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they ' re shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot .
what ' s your point ?
do you know him ?
he bought our dream house . we worked a lifetime , saved up for a down payment , then he swooped down with his fancy schmancy lawyers and grabbed it out from under us .
<person> , this is the attendance office at blue bay school . your son or daughter is absent today , monday .

because i know you ' re full of shit .
i mean it , <person> . i ' m getting out of here , and i want to take you with me .
sure . <person> . <continued_utterance> long as you don ' t ask me to fill in your questionnaire .
we ' ve played your game now , and so we can finally agree with the others that you are the world ' s greatest game artist .
i know you didn ' t but you have been so thoughtful .
but when your sunflowers come up , i ' ll pay you for them .
you ruined my life , <person> . me and my wife . and i am going to ruin yours . you don ' t have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years . my wife ' s been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .

<person> , `` <person> '' , whatever you say .
keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty that register ! <person> ' t just let him leave , could ya ! you know what i ' m gon na do to ya for that ? huh ? do ya ? !
the one girl i really wanted , and you took her from me . you ' re insane . you ' re losing it , man .
you have revealed yourself .

i ' m making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that doesn ' t bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
yes . yes . that ' s exactly it . yes .
yeah , that ' s what he said .

<person> engineering .
<person> ' s theory of eternal recurrence .
<person> ? are you insane ? this is her pipeline .

your boy sought this out .
you ' re right . these are the actions of a boy . treat them as such . you and i can stop this before there ' s further bloodshed .
ok . he fell asleep watching tv . so he lives there now ?
yeah . your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia , <person> . so sometimes he does things and says things that don ' t make sense .
i think you should .

<person> . tell <person> that nothing .
<person> up <person> ! <person> ?
i know , right ? can you believe that ? !
<person> shit ! he was thirty-five and one as a freshman !

oh my god . this man ' s tissue .
so this is all my fault , is it .
just shut up .
the car .
i thought maybe you saw some chick walking by . i lost my concentration . why do they call cars ' she ' ? they never say ' he ' . always ' she . ' <continued_utterance> very nice . very nice .

i ' m not . <person> i ' m gon na need some more stuff . i mean it . i ' m out .
<person> , and i ' m gon na need that ten thousand dollars back .
wow . that ' s too bad . he sounds almost perfect .

<person> in there , i ' ll think of something .
<person> ? fine . get a hold of <person> , i ' d be more than glad to talk to him .
oh , not
you ' re the one with all the ideas .
you ' ve had your say , wes . now leave it .
<person> knocked me out .
he ' s having you tailed then .
<person> , are you my best friend ?
of course . <continued_utterance> what is it <person> ? what ' s wrong ?

how did they know ?
<person> ' s going to hurt you . <continued_utterance> you see that ? gold . you take us to the americans , and we ' ll give you another one . now drive .
you are americans , yes ? <continued_utterance> we didn ' t not all want this war , do you know ? we didn ' t not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in kuwait . now your army crushes us . so few days , and so many have died . and many fear we will all die . <person> tell this to your people : we did not want this war . <continued_utterance> i have a brother in our army . when i take you back , will you look for him ? if he is still alive , will you look for him and take care of him ?
mr . <person> ?
that ' s right .
hey .
i have something for you .
no . it didn ' t show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
this looks like new grass to you ?
<person> , fall semester , first day of class , it was <number> degrees and you were wearing the coat . <person> just blinks , no ready answer-available . <continued_utterance> that ' s why they all give you such a hard time in workshop .
because of my coat ?
but it must be planted , cultivated , nurtured . unless . unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation .
you ask many questions . time traveller yes ! and i ' m not ashamed of it . that is how man has learned and bettered himself . i must learn about you and your civilization . you have books , don ' t you ? young man <person> . - <person> ! yes , we have books . he rises and beckons . the time traveller ' s brow clears .
what do you guys want ?
we want the dope . <person> .
<person> on .
yes sir .
i am buying it . make no mistake about that .
<person> for you , <person> .
i . do you want me to leave ?
you do what you want . you want to leave . you want to go kill yourself ?
that ' s the same as even .
wheels within wheels . it ' s nice how you take care of the money for both of us because you ' re older and so level headed . i wonder where i ' d be now if hadn ' t saved your life ?
<person> ' t touch , don ' t touch .
it ' s dead all right . tore the damn thing in half .
but .
we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we ' re out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .
<person> - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field .
will they take the harness ?
we can ' t do anything till it ' s dark .
guess you haven ' t been here in a while . ' <person> ' . <continued_utterance> say , who ' s this guy laughin ' ?
where exactly ?
you sure you ' re not trying to keep me here ? <continued_utterance> why wouldn ' t i ?
his is a mistake .
i think this might be the reason i am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today . <continued_utterance> i ' m reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant . that it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place -- you must walk around it . if our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them . to see the entire elephant . and for that . they need our help .
how was i ?
fast . <continued_utterance> i ' m basically a coward , russell , i hope you understand that . i hope we don ' t get shot .
everyone is gone . <person> is in the bathroom .
i was looking through my trunk and i can ' t find my toby .
goddamnit , <person> , you won ' t go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z .
well , sure .
he was only a game character .
but <person> . what if we ' re not in the game anymore ?
but , in particular ?
i . mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that ' s where i have to go .
how ' bout <person> ?
on his way to miami .
i was thinking of you .
and ?
from the moment i first saw you i knew i was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks , and when you started talking i was smitten and i ' m smitten more every day i think about you -- and the fact that you know i ' m full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually i can bullshit people but i can ' t bullshit you and in addition , most women i ' m thinking about how to get into their pants from day one but with you i ' m just thinking about how to get into your heart -- molly was clue-less . she just stares .
my god .
no . ! <continued_utterance> great . what are we supposed to do now ?
do you know how to play pool ?
oh , my . a kind offer , but i really must .
it ' s just . i don ' t think i could bear to be alone tonight .
no thank you , mr . <person> .
you know i ' d never admit this at home , but <person> is for peasants . there ' s much we could learn from the italians .
i hear things . it ' s hard to surprise me . <continued_utterance> and what else ?
<person> said that i ' m your bodyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety .
and just who the hell is <person> ?
dad ' s girlfriend .
my badge is in my jacket . <person> pocket .
show me .
<person> ' s see yours .
no .
what ' s going on , <person> ?
<person> is just going to ask <person> a few questions . <person> , we ' re not even sure which agency <person> works for . now , <person> is absolutely first class , but on the other hand we have <person> , here , who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for <number> years . so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist .
whats that ?
i dont know . looks like clothes .
the corner . <person> <number> . <continued_utterance> see the one with the funny colored hair ? crazy bitch stabbed one of my men in the knee-cap . there they are , american . the low-rent millionaire criminals . and you thought only your country had white trash . american ? <continued_utterance> oh no ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! <continued_utterance> what the hell . ?
that ' s the guy .
wait a minute ! wait a minute !
you wanted to win me just to get even with my husband . screw you !
you sure ?
yeah . i ' m good . why ?
death therapy cured me !
no !
good .
so let me ask you something , <person> . you think you might want to wrestle in a match ?
how are you ?
guess who i saw today on the subway ?
<person> : why , you dirty , old -
skip that word .
he was a small man . oh collapses face down in the sand .
we ' ve got to keep moving . i ' ve got you , buddy -- just like always .
what ?
i believe that ' s the law . is it not , mr . <person> . ?
what time is it ? do you think you can just treat us like your slave ?
i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late .
that ' s my business .
i hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again . you gon na write a letter to your horse ? <continued_utterance> after you find your horse , i ' ve lost my needle in a haystack , and i could use some help . <continued_utterance> anything valuable . anyone who comes back gets to share it out .
and you didn ' t feel like you could trust my wife with this news ?
i just didn ' t want to take a chance . i didn ' t want to risk it . it could have been frozen along with everything else .
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you weren ' t saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
some people grow up and change their ways .
of course you are .
how can i ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time , <person> ?
<person> , <person> , i know you ' re-
you know nothing . what you don ' t <person> would fill a book . <person> , i feel like it ' s when you ' re around i need it most . you ' re never yourself , you never relax . never . everything ' s so stiff and dead . you always have to keep a rein on everything , ever yourself . oh , you smile sometimes , i ' ve even seen you laugh . but there ' s no light in your smile for me , <person> , nothing to keep me warm . and i get cold , <person> . i get so cold . what ' s between you and that <person> woman ?
<person> , lady , i can be back in thirty minutes with a search warrant and a handful of cops , and i can probably have you arrested , whether or not the charges would stick . now do you want to let me in and talk ?
have you got a badge ?
how long have you known about this ? <continued_utterance> how long have you known ?
six months . i found some marijuana , that ' s all . and a little pipe about two inches long . i talked with her . she said her friends smoked pot and drank --
i know . i know . you ' re right .
i just want to go to ohio and . beat the crap out of his mom .
because i guarantee she ' s married and has a couple kids . girls like <person> don ' t stay single .
what if you ' re wrong ? you just said she ' s the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ?
is that what you were trained to do ?
no .
nah . i ' m . i ' m nothing .
oh . well i am .
your roommate won ' t mind ?
oh , <person> went home for the weekend .
course i am , mama .
what times <person>s train get in ?
what do you look for ?
we ask questions and measure the answers . when something doesn ' t ring true , a fact that doesn ' t make sense , a slight hesitation , then it ' s off to secondary for a closer look . <person> nafta we had about <number> . <number> million trucks a year . now it ' s almost double . pretty soon there ' ll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .
spare me the compassionate father routine , <person> . the suit don ' t fit .
i ' m really trying here , <person> .
<person> ? well , it ' s the law , mr . <person> . has been since <number> they tell me . <person> - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported .
<person> . <person> , okay .
i don ' t know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i ' m in so far , they ' d kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i ' m like you said , a criminal .
i ' m busted up for you , but <person> , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn ' t lift a finger .
how do you do ?
what kind of accommodations would you like ? we can give you a fairly wide choice -- any room in the inn , including mine .
why not ? <continued_utterance> by the way , <person> , you were right about your wife . she ' s a good lady . i ' m glad you got her back .
and i ' m glad you got your sense of humor back . think you ' ll keep it ?
and another thing , the paper said no will was found . but every toon knows <person> had a will and , in it he promised to leave <person> to the toons .
so where is it then ?
how interesting . i thought we were going to keep judy out of this .
<person> to me carefully . i saw one of their meetings . it was above a convenience store .
you can ' t play around with these tent people .
i ' m not playing around . i forgot .
i ' m not quite sure yet . <continued_utterance> <person> . <continued_utterance> who are you ? really ?
you ' ll see soon enough .
you go look .
me ?
what key ?
that key right there !
oh , yeah ?
that ' s right and this is my dad ' s car . you ' re lucky that you ' re in it . i ' m not normally allowed to drive it `cause it ' s so -
i know .
you need to see a doctor , mr . <person> . an internist . and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist , as well .
you what ?
it ' s bullshit . <person> ' s got no intention of honoring it . they want stemmons files though . i think <person> ' s been working angles for awhile , doing his own investigations .
simple . and it could happen . <person> destroys the terrorist insurgents , rebuilds the country , shitcans the purveyors of excess , stabilizes the cordoba , and is finally beloved as the savior of nicaragua . our pal . got a smoke ?
what ' s the downside ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> you ' re such a morning person .
it is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic . she starts to leave . <person> calls out .
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir . maybe that ' s what he was after ?
look , doll , if i wanted underwear , i woulda broken into <person> ' s of hollywood . i was lookin ' for <person> ' s will .
you fucked me , man ? why would you do that ?
what do you mean ' why ' ?
what does that mean ?
the neuro-filter acts like a surge protector , regulating the infinite flow of information from cerebro to
four o ' clock . m will meet you in the conference room .
<number> : <number> . it may take me a little longer to wrap things up here .
what ?
lift me down . <continued_utterance> you can let go of me now . i ' m safe . how do they look ?
to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us .
you did a great job . she ' s a good kid .
every day for the last five years , i told myself someday i would be out here again . no more bars . no more guards . no more fights just to stay alive . every day for the last five years , i told myself that lie .
it wasn ' t a lie .
<person> , well wait up for me tonight . i ' ll see what i can do about that .
promises , promises .
they ' re anxiety attacks ? that ' s a little disappointing .
<person> luck next time .
then what are you trying to say then ?
maybe you can ' t see what ' s happening here , but it ' s clear to me . i appreciate what you ' re trying to do <person> . maybe you could live with it , but i couldn ' t . if you think i ' m going to let a sixteen year old take responsibility , then you underestimate me . the <person> was my ship . the ocean academy was my school . her loss is mine and mine alone . i can ' t bring your sons back . if you want my ticket , if that will ease your loss , it ' s the least i can do . this . <continued_utterance> this is easy . living with it , that ' ll be hard .
<person> , i know you get approached a lot by dubious men , but i ' m different , i never talk to strangers , all my life i ' ve been waiting for the right person to walk across the room . you ' re that person , you don ' t know it but i do and if you walk away now i ' ll never see you again or you me . you ' ll grow old .
oh really .
yeah . it ' s really g-g-good --
-- it blows .
<person> ' t you fall apart on me . <person> , thelma . every time we get in trouble , you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit , and this time . not this time . everything ' s changed now . now you can do whatever you want , but i ' m going to mexico . i ' m going . are you coming with me ?
i think he does . <person> around .
what ' s that ?
it ' s my pink-fone . i ' m not sure i should answer it .
what ?
come see , i said . <continued_utterance> the poor thing , she ' s really wiped out .
. yes ? .
i could come for a second opinion ?
<person> ' s a very jealous person .
that would be the reason . <person> . he thinks she might be going for this . <continued_utterance> so it ' s like you want to be secret friends .
i brought you here so that you would be safe from magneto .
who ?
forget him , <person> , let ' s just do it .
<person> up ! you keep still or i ' m gon na make damn sure you stop breathing today . got that ?
oh , yes ?
yeah . i ' m gon na live on his ranch in phoenix . the `` <person> , '' it ' s called .
<person> .
<person> ' t disappear on me again .
is there a picture ? <continued_utterance> so that explains it .
he was in jail .
i want to buy a gun .
<person> . <continued_utterance> i ' ve got winchesters . colts . what do you plan on hunting ?
you still hanging in there with <person> ?
i ' m hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun . by younger men .
i concede i bring out the worst in you , but let me help you not to say something you ' ll just torture yourself about for years to come . she starts to smile and he removes his hand . they look at each other . <continued_utterance> i hope you ' re better soon . it would be a shame to miss new york in the spring .
thank you for the daisies .
i ' m sorry .
what are you doing in these parts ?
i said in the ad . thousand dollars firm .
thousand , huh ? that must be with a guarantee .
they found prints at blue legs ' place .
<person> . <person> ' s prints are there . but they cross over <person> ' s prints . and he wasn ' t there until six o ' clock the mornin ' after to get eggs from the chickens . so <person> wasn ' t there til the next day . <person> ? <continued_utterance> look , man . you better bust <person> and get out before somebody shoots up more than your car next time .
would you boys stop it ? !
tackle him !
i hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again . you gon na write a letter to your horse ? <continued_utterance> after you find your horse , i ' ve lost my needle in a haystack , and i could use some help . <continued_utterance> anything valuable . anyone who comes back gets to share it out .
<person> here . <continued_utterance> remember that day me and <person> raced you in your car ?
what you want to watch this trash for ? aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain .
that so ? you want to tell me what , if any , real thoughts you had lately ?
<person> only gon na sing that song to my wife .
what you want to watch this trash for ? aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain .
why not ?
because i ' m the mother , and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life ' til you ' re eighteen . seriously , we ' ve got no money . i can ' t buy you the moccasins .
congratulations , porthos . you brought down the house .
my aim was off . i was trying to hit <person> .
what ?
you fucking prick , we had a deal -- you said you wouldn ' t fuck me and i wouldn ' t fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture . you crossed the line , man . <person> backs away nervously .
does she drool ? does she cry all night long ? does she chew on her fists ? does she put everything into her mouth ?
i know she can ' t talk .
you think i ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks ? i don ' t want your silly billion dollar empire ?
that ' s a good start , yes . a very good start .
this is important .
oh ?
are you listening to me ?
put your arms around my neck . lock your legs around my waist .
how many have you done ?
three . well , you ' ll be the third .
and how . so where do we go now chief ?
there are other forces at work here . faces we need to identify . names we need to know . a third party .
what ' re those ?
i ordered these from the golf channel .
scenic detour .
no way ! get back on the highway .
i know where i am . i ' m on federal land , doing a federal investigation , and if you don ' t wan na cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car , and spend the rest of the day in a little room , answering federal questions . it ' s your call . who are you ?
i ' m a full blood <person> , born and raised on this reservation .
stop worrying . he won ' t get any place with her .
you sure ?
aw , come on , <person> !
but at the very least . it does suggest he ' s been co-opted by hard line elements .
<person> or skinny ?
er , skinny , i think .
i ' d be clever as a gizzard -- <continued_utterance> then i ' m sure to get a brain --
a heart --
the americans have their money . i left it all for them .

do things together that are enjoyable .
what would we do together for it to be enjoyable ?
<person> , save it for somebody else will ya . this ancient shit doesn ' t have anything to do with me . lawford pauses for a moment and then explodes theatrically .
<person> ? ! ! ! <continued_utterance> <person> for me please the words of mr . keats at the bottom of the page .
listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely don ' t regret . is the choice . i made to be your mother . <continued_utterance> i miss you .

that ' s exactly why we need them .
we couldn ' t have missed him ?
no way . <person> ' s get a coffee before the next shuttle .

in the last mayoral election , when <person> was running against <person> , i went to get a manicure and forgot to vote .
appearances aren ' t everything . keep your mind on the road . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
i don ' t feel like driving . <person> ?
<person> ever come out here ? <continued_utterance> i say something funny ?
no . but i mean . just the idea that mr . <person> would .

hey , did the feds dig your pad ? <continued_utterance> -i see anybody near there <person> , the deals off and i gift that file to <person> to fuck you with-
besides an apology ?
unless you ' re planning on leaving <person> , there ' s gon na be other cases , other days . you might want to keep that in mind .
he ' s not so --
he ' s an idiot , and he ' s not nearly as hard as he thinks .
fuck you , <person> . you ' re paying me to write my novel , so you own me .
i don ' t own you . you ' re brilliant , you ' re good-looking , you ' re handsome .
i have enough money . but thanks .
well , good luck , <person> .
mr . <person> -
come on , out with it .
just like that ? these people ruined your life , bro . <continued_utterance> i told you they were going overboard and they did . they ' ll settle . believe me . they ' ll be begging to settle .
you don ' t think you ' re overdoing it ?
are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl ?
my guards are from south africa , mr . <person> . this is their chance to get even with the formerly ' <person> ' britain . now both of you . put your hands on your heads , and step forward .
<person> , that thing . <person> ' t you .
rules are rules , mr . <person> .
you ' re straddling the state line . you ' re in two places at once . <continued_utterance> repeat after me .
i can ' t .
he was blowin ' his lines , all right .
so what ? he ' s already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule !
play `` <person> '' -- anything .
<person> . just do it the way you sang it this afternoon -- you ' ll be great .
will you calm down . <person> ' s gon na come to you just like he did to me .
<person> , but he can ' t push you around like he can me . you ' ve got family and they ' ve got clout . with we it ' s different . with me .
i just want to look at it . remind me of what i ' m dying for .
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
<person> . you understand .
did you call about the feurs ?
this is insane .
all i can tell you <person> , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay .
about things . about your wife .
<person> ? what about her ?
maybe i did . <person> first . <person> cant ever stop talkin bout that town .
on one condition . <continued_utterance> you give me your permission to kill <person> .
did you ever have to use this thing ?
that is called a crab apple switch . it ' s for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i don ' t know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk ' s stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down <person> and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was <person> . my daddy taught both of us to play but <person> was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named <person> sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . <person> had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl ' s room and he wouldn ' t stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
and anyway , we ' re friends , aren ' t we ?
always .
tie it off ! !
outer .
are you gon na stay in town for a while ?
well , i don ' t know . i got all these things i got ta do back in worcester .
<person> ' t deserve it ! ? ! i ' d have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level .
well , whatever you said to <person> , it was enough to get him to give <person> a black eye .
i got a postcard from you from alaska . ?
<person> , i was up there for a while .
<person> !
<person> ! do you know where <person> is ?
who else ?
<person> for instants .
i was ?
that seems to be the local custom .
hi , <person> . <person> ! when did you get in ?
just now .
i don ' t see the connection .
the connection is , it did a head number on him . he ' s petrified of cars . <person> ' t drive . i ' ve known him all my life , and he ' s never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle . he rides passenger and he rides horses , and that ' s it . the man that shot <person> down was behind the wheel of a moving car .
that ' s the code word . i miss you , peaches .
<person> , <person> . thanks .
i ' ve fallen over something , <person> .
are you okay ? you look like shit .

it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i don ' t have the money .
<person> ' t you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . <person> ' t you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?

you ever think that maybe you was sent here cuz the fbi ' s need one good reason to take out the entire warrior movement . and what better reason than one of their men , gettin ' blown away on the res . a low-rent , expendable public servant sent in to take a bullet for his country .
i ' m sick of your shit --
mcnamara won ' t be able to handle them . it ' s too much for one man . . with all due respect to our heroic fifth column .
we ' ve got <person> ' s attention with the blockade . if we want a political solution . i think it ' s time to turn up the diplomatic heat . <person> if we let this go on too long , we ' re going to find ourselves in a war .

i want an hour with him .
i said his heart , not his attention .
`` terminator '' climbing claws . <continued_utterance> miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .
they come in any other styles or colors ?
i know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?
dad , let ' s just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .
what the hell are you doing ?

our girls aren ' t afraid of rats .
force comm cleared you to give us total cooperation , right ?
<person> , but . . .
what if he wasn ' t aloud to kick and you were really mad at him ?
no . <continued_utterance> how much did you take off ?
doesnandiacute ; t it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?
it does indeed , <person> .
you must overcome your fears and regain control . <person> hold of your life again . it ' s as easy as holding that glass . what if i told you that you can take control of all of this . everything . even me .
<person> . i ' m straight , okay ?
well , of course not . my goodness , what a fuss you ' re making . well , naturally , when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why , you ' re nothing but a great big coward !
you ' re right -- i am a coward . <continued_utterance> i haven ' t any courage at all . i even scare myself . <person> at the circles under my eyes .
you ' re masking hostility , <person> . <person> that down .
it ' s full of freudian symbols , dad . it ' s educational .
why does everyone keep saying that ?
you may be able to fool the rest of
yeah .
what did you do ?
really , <person> , you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than <person> got pills . <person> to take it easy . go over to <person> for a few days .
im stayin right here by the phone until you find <person> , then im comin to get her . you call soons you got somethin , even if its three in the a . m .
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
wow . <person> here just in time . i brought you this .

you look good . how are you ?
no sweat . only do me a favor ?
sure .
they ' ve announced the possibility that <person> will delay the release of your new system indefinitely , until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is . i don ' t approve , myself . i don ' t think we should bend one degree to extremists .
<person> for the fanatics ? what does that mean ?
because if more of you . were like more of us . like more of us .
. the un summit . the whole world will be watching .
<person> well . load your guns .
what was that , admiral ?
you sure you want me too ? <continued_utterance> i pick that way .
<person> . then we go this way .
bullshitter !
fuck you , it ' s true .
what ' s that ?
well . if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school . in the long run you ' d save them thousands of dollars . i mean look at the cost of dental bills . i bet i could have put my kids through college with what i ' ve spent on fillings .
you ' re going to be fine .
you ' re not going to let me die , are you ! ? <person> ' t let me die ! ignoring the question:

where are you , <person> ?
i ' m on the roof .
why couldn ' t he have just told you all these things ?
he talks loud . and he loves his code .
you ' re right about the old man . his power ' s long dried up . he ' s supposed to be a medicine man but he won ' t go see the people . he says we changed , and we don ' t listen . well , he don ' t go out and talk no more . i haven ' t had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar , and this <person> is gettin ' watered .
cut the shit . you shouldn ' t be in here , <person> .
<person> ' , boss . just old smokies . <person>nly place they can come for a puff . it ' s all banned topside .

some of them pay a little more than that . <continued_utterance> i would have had to bounce for a month to make what i made in two hours last night . <continued_utterance> and these guys , they ' re not real fighters . they ' re just guys who have seen too much ufc on tv . if you have a better solution , i ' m all ears .
what are we gon na tell the girls ?
no , you ' re right , you ' re right --
what are you talking about ?

where is she <person> ? -
what is it , <person> ? you haven ' t the guts ?
<person> ' s stuff . <continued_utterance> so do i need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything ?
it ' s more emotional damage . it wasn ' t very serious physically . <continued_utterance> nothing like when i sent you to the hospital .
i don ' t think so . because he ' s a foreigner . he ' ll come back to the city . after six years in confinement , it ' s the only place that ' s familiar to him . that ' s important .
a man murders two children in cold blood . a jury declares him insane . how could such a person not be ? <continued_utterance> he is sent to a state mental institution where the security is . less than perfect . and he escapes . it . it isn ' t fair .
yes i do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
you don ' t understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
oh-oh- cu - <person> crying - speaks -
it ' s only a man without a head who could do a thing like that . <person> little bee . cu - dorothy reacts - reaches o . s . -

he was the prime suspec-
-he was screaming about `set-ups , ' and about how a `cop ' killed <person> -- he thought i was you <person> . the gray <person> that gunned him down showed up three minutes after my dispatch call .
<person> , buddy . thinking big is fine . . but you shouldn ' t forget where you come from , either .
you know , you ' re absolutely right . would you mind sitting over there ?
that ' s right on my way .
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
everything .
we love you , ted . we always did . we always will .
we ' re being run out . apparently , <person> was so optimistic about money coming in for <person> , he figured he ' d double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with ringling . so he sent mr . <person> into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job . <person> , she . <continued_utterance> . she was the police chief ' s wife . mr . <person> got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town .

<person> , please . this is out of your hands .

l . e . we hold a court order .
<person> , it ' s not your fault , and it ' s not your decision .
i ' m not gon na let it happen <person> .
you ' re also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that ' ll never see a screen , regardless if it ' s leading lady gets `kidnapped ' or not .
this isn ' t the first time you ' ve spied on me .
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
<person> , but we made that deal while <person> was still alive . he ' s gone . time for a new deal .

i had a nightmare one night and i didn ' t wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . i think that was the first time . does that count ? megan that counts .
we ' ve been pawns in someone ' s game . they tricked us into bringing the money to king . not just elaborate . cock-sure .
and expensive . cost three million plus .
they ' re not going to --
it ' s the only way . we drive ! <continued_utterance> wave at them . <person> ' t look , just wave .
yes . not to be morbid , but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides .
huh . quite a hike just to end your life .
so what does he want ?
what does he want ? he wants revenge .
aw shit . <continued_utterance> help me with this guy .

what reputation ? you ' re nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumbleweed hick .
it ' s queens , dad and a <number> % mortgage and you rent the top room -- i got ta live in manhattan to be a player , dad . there ' s no nobility in poverty anymore , y ' know . one day you ' re going to be proud of me , you ' ll see .

i don ' t trust the driver !
i know how you feel -- i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours . you know it ' s against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state .

what ' s that supposed to mean ?

kind of a mean place to be . <person> cold , unfriendly .
we ' re not canceling .
i know .
well , you ' re half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
about what ?
come on !
no .
perhaps . but it does explain how an ex-kgb agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people . if you believe what you read in the papers .
need i remind the two of you that <person> - sir <person> - is directly descended from the earl of aberdeen ? that his scottish ancestors practically invented hong kong - and out of sheer gratitude , <person> herself named the port `` <person> '' in their honor ?
it ' s for last week ' s game .
i ' ve come to understand that . an ill advised purchase in the parking lot .
we can pool our savings and i ' ve got some sick leave coming , besides my regular vacation .

well , of course , we can understand that .
well . let me go get him .
thank you . that ' s a valuable lesson . <person> , come on .
mrs . <person> -- this gets her attention -- <continued_utterance> your husband owes a lot of money . enough that snapping this kid ' s neck wouldn ' t nearly cover it . <continued_utterance> you better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is going to disappear , and he won ' t turn up until the evening news . <continued_utterance> you get exactly one warning . <continued_utterance> the first payment is three million dollars .
gawd . you ' re . beautiful .

i just thought it might be nice to do something together , that ' s all . thought it might be fun .
nothing . why ? do i seem different ?
yes , now that you mention it . you seem crazy . like you ' re on drugs .
i do .
when did you break up ?
so you ' ll dredge the bottom again . you ' ve done that before . the results were . uneven .
you wan na find out about rats , ask a rat . i ' ve had my people put together a talent pool . i downloaded it to your desktop . <continued_utterance> the usual prospects . convicts , contract killers , murde .
will you be sure to tell them about it ?
absolutely . <person> ' t worry about a thing .
how the fuck do i know ? ! <continued_utterance> torch them ! !
but .
you ' ve heard that every man in the musketeers is on the run from someone or something ?

think the iraqi ' s killed them all ?
probably shot a few . scattered the rest . murderers . <continued_utterance> you saw how he ran didn ' t you ? first chance he got he ran out . would have gone straight to his co , told him all about the gold . what do you think would have happened then , huh ? then what do you think would have happened ? two thousand screaming iraqis bearing down on us . you ought to thank me for killing him . i ' ll get a medal for it . <person> and see if i don ' t get a medal .
you ' d think he wasn ' t sitting here facing life in prison .
this has worked for years and it will continue to work for years . nafta makes everything more difficult for you . the border is disappearing . you people are like those japanese soldiers left behind on deserted islands who think that world war ii is still going on . let me be the first to tell you , your government surrendered this war a long time ago .

this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
are you and hannah seeing each other , <person> ?
no ! what gave you that idea ?
of him i think .
did she say that ?
i would have asked for your phone number and i wouldn ' t have been able to wait <number> hours before calling and asking , `` how about coffee , drinks , dinner , a movie , for as long as we both shall live ? ''
<person> .
i ' m gon na just tell her i ' m waiting .

you want to insult me ? this is my hospitality . pick one . <continued_utterance> good , now find a room to crash in . <person> , show him .

when all is done , we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds . then i , the bastard son , will have accomplished what <person> and <person> never could .
<person> ?
sweated up like a stuck pig . and be careful . he was fucking around with his front door before he left . i don ' t know what he was doing .

i think you have a gift for it . it was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness .
nope . it ' s that <person> outfit again .
what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
what were you doing in my room ?
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet . now why did you lie to me ? where did you go ?
oh , man , i ' ve never eaten so good in my life . why don ' t you develop a useful skill ?
yeah , like turning into a beautiful woman .
federal bureau of investigation , <person> and <person> . <person> to disturb you , but we would like to see <person> ' trailer , please .

so what are you gon na tell him ?
nothing . i ' m not gon na tell him a thing . the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is .
because my opinion threatens yours , it ' s poorly developed ?
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes <number> % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .
you just go when i say go .
should have at least gotten the map off of him . <person> up with him then we did all this for nothing .
where are you , <person> ? an elevator ?
i ' m in kinship . <person> , <person> , there ' s some things we need to talk about .

my husband !
parents still together ?
yes .
<person> can ' t hold the throne ?
<person> couldn ' t hold his pecker without <person> ' s help and he knows that . he ' s gon na bury himself like a tick . <person> luck turning him up , he took six or seven grand out the safe tonight .
yeah . it ' s already been hit .

but i don ' t understand how the slate gets wiped clean when he breaks into my house and i ' m the one charged .
i ' m cooking you dinner .
you don ' t have to do that .
i can be better . i will be . and i hate the way i am anymore ! i don ' t know why i do it ! what about that stenotyping thing you were gon na do ?
it won ' t happen . it won ' t happen . it won ' t happen . things aren ' t going to turn out well , things aren ' t going to start looking up , and it ' s never going to be like heaven on a june day . there is no uranium . there is no stenotyping . there is no c . p . a . license . there isn ' t . <continued_utterance> . i talked to dwight : after <person> , he wants you to come up to concrete and live with him for a few months -- go to school there .
that ' s weird . i talked to your brother jimmy five or six times . ted is devastated to hear this . mary by the way , how ' s he doing ?
he ' s dead .
and old war injury flaring up ?
is the tape on ?
what , are you one of those people who can ' t pee with the bathroom door open ?
no . but it ' s not something i
no sin ? maybe . not yet . but , <person> , it does not look . <person> ' t you know there has been talk ? <person> about you , not him . <person> about going to the bishop . about having you . shunned !
that is idle talk .
why ?
cause that ' s the way they do it . <continued_utterance> so it ' s five guys , <person> casino . <person> hundred bucks and you do the thing with the rubber hoses . are you in ? <person> , are you in ? good . boyd hangs up , puts on his jacket and turns with the same bizarre insincere smile in his photo . <person> extended . <continued_utterance> <person> boyd , nice to meet you .
i don ' t care what you believe as long as you leave me alone .
<person> , i ' m calling you out .
<person> . where the fuck did they send us ?
a long way from home . you be careful out there .
what ?
i doctored my grades so i ' d make the cut . i ' m a moron , okay ? you satisfied ? !
<person> . yes . yes . <number> . <number> at <number> . <number> for <number> . at <number> . <number> at <number> . i ' m amazed the windows don ' t blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed , ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards .
i just want her to be happy .
oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
a beach named x ? that i ' d like to see .
so there you have it . i guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?
two , three months . maybe less .
so you ' ve given up .
rough ain ' t it . thank you everybody , very nice . <continued_utterance> i don ' t think <person> is dead . i ' m gon na find him .
they say he ' s very handsome . it would make a wonderful picture , eh ?
you ' re the last person who should be whining about being a `` crew '' .
how do you figure that ?
you and i know each other . you found me on the internet .
what do you want ? why are you following me ?
i still got a day job , pete-
-tossing more bantamweights out windows ?
we shouldn ' t have been here , <person> . there is a war going on !
this is miles from the battle lines .
wherever you go on the planet , i ' ll find you . there ' s no quitting . if you try to take it off , a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground . is all that clear ?
yeah , i spy or i die .
you should , she ' s your mother . respect that . can you turn that down ? i hate that judge . i wouldn ' t be in this place if it wasn ' t for her .
but this place is pretty nice .
then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home , you get rid of the gun . <continued_utterance> please . <continued_utterance> was that all of them ?
yes .
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
who said that ?
go catch <person> , <person> . <person> . he ' s gettin ' away . go ahead , go get him . i ' m late .
hey . hey , those are my sunglasses you ' re wearing .
i think i ' ve lost my appetite .
a shame . mutant creatures provide new and previously unimagined taste sensations . <continued_utterance> shall i clear all this away ?
i ' m useless , <person> . i feel so useless .
that ' s not true . no one can make you feel inferior without your consent .
he ' s got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you ' re standing naked in the display window of macy ' s . he ' s using you . only you ' re too blind to see it .
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who can ' t stand that his son ' s become more successful than himself .
ky .
she started saying it at the match today .
it ' s no arsonist ' s <person> , but i guess you know that . it ' s a young man ' s book . it got me remembering how it felt to be young .
maybe i should read it .
<person> , i had to go slummin ' . <person> , a friend of mine ' s bein ' framed .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .
<person> you stupid fuck , i want my car .
i will be the judge of what is best . for me , and for france .
of course . forgive me .
yes . now that you have , what will you do ?
bring you back . to pay for what you did to my son .
no great loss --
i need to go out .
he said something like , `` do you want it dirty <number> '' or something . i tried to turn away , but he pushed me to the floor .
was there penetration ? did he put himself inside you ?
what does she do ?
some kinda legal secretary of something . <person> to some boring jerk . <continued_utterance> and she could be so hot , if she wanted to be . she ' s like a dying plant that just needs a little water .
<person> , it ' s so cute .
<person> ! get back here ! it might bite you .
no , i don ' t . not a thing . i don ' t feel a thing . uh , do you want me to do you ?
what the hell was that ?
get off him ! <continued_utterance> what happened ?
i told you . he tried to steal our gold .
<person> ' t smile at me . it ' s not going to get you out of this .
why not ? it always has before .
<person> , whoa , you ' re getting crazy now . why would i cross the line -- what do you think i got no pride ? healy grabs <person> by the neck . tucker i swear ! i didn ' t tell her nothing ! you probably did it yourself , you piece of shit .
oh that makes a lot of sense . why would i rat myself out ?
how much we got ta lose ?
you want to liven things up , <person> ? that ' s a hell of an idea . say everyone puts in twenty bucks and the pot goes to whoever solves the riddle .
where is he ?
he ' s right here in the . <continued_utterance> . car .
sure i ' m sure . what is this ?
well , i was thinking , we ' ve <person> made a pile of money . maybe we should just pull up <person> and move on . and we could stay on the move , you know ? just keep going , see the world . <person> room service the rest of our lives . how ' d that be ?
he ' s trying to put it behind him , <person> . you should too . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got a beautiful life . and even with this , it ' s always been clear that he loves you . i ' ve come to think that ' s all that really matters .
i don ' t know .
the gold ; give it to me . <continued_utterance> give it to me !
if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
this speculation --
i ' ll rephrase . did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise ?
i ' m impressed . <person> . i need transportation to the . uh . the sphinx .
i ' m sorry , sir . but earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely . no one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles . <continued_utterance> oh . do you want the item you left with us ?
come on , i ' ll make you some waffles , maybe we ' ll squeeze in a trip to the mall . <person> .
<person> . <continued_utterance> you ' re such a morning person .
i good you bid evening .
<person> on , i ' ll go with you .
what do you want me to say ? everything you said about me was true , <person> . i was just a big chickenshit jerk , and now i ' m payin ' the price .

i ' m talking about <person> insurance . i ' m talking about money .
pros -- prozze <person> . daj noge .

<person> !
and the day they wrecked the apartment , <person> came home and couldn ' t find <person> . i ' ve never seen him in tears like that bef .
never mind about that . <person> , <person> , you got us into this mess , and you ' re going to help us get out of it .
you mean like pedal pushers ?
i guess .
<person> ' t worry , <person> . if there ' s one thing i ' m good at , it ' s charm- ing a woman . <continued_utterance> so . <person> ' t live without me , huh ?
lose your skirt ? how embarrassing .
he killed the dolphin .
the <person> was a symptom .
did he try to kiss you ?
all week long .
<person> up buddy buddy . you shook gekko the great ' s hand and you still got all your fingers . he ' s not the only elephant in the jungle .
. a dog with fleas .
<person> , <person> , tapped the phone ? you think so ?
oh , come on ! murder one and armed robbery , thelma !
who ?
<person> in <person> and prejudice . she was too proud --
replaced by a better life under these beautiful monet-like skies .
my mother ' s favorite .
i ' ll take a ride .
go for it .
that -- would be an antelope -- or a deer -- a deerpalope .
it looks like maya .
not me . i ' m in my prime .
<person> , you look it .
he ' s fine . not injured at all . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> a . <continued_utterance> <person> , my friend .
what happened ?
<person> , i ' m not . remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis ? that ' s all it was was talk . i was scared out of my mind to go to war . i still haven ' t gotten over stepping on that land mine .
you still got a map on you ?
elektra , it ' s not too late . eight million people needn ' t die .
you should have killed me when you had the chance . but you couldn ' t . not me . a woman you ' ve loved .
absolutely !
and give her a bath everyday , and don ' t let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed .
you didn ' t tell me about <person> --
-- what the hell is <person> ?
there ' s a cop on the doorstep . he didn ' t see you . he mustn ' t see you . we ' re in deep trouble , <person> .
tell me what .
with what ? i said , go right on ahead with what ?
whatever , dude .
no ! !
<person> . ! !
i ' m honored , <person> , but i don ' t think i would be very popular with the other men . not after today .
i suppose not . your heart is set on being a musketeer . when i was your age , i too had dreams of joining the musketeers .
how is old <person> ?
gone fishing .
i mean my father .
a father is nothing but sperm , ted .
you can drop it now , <person> . the game is over . your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented .
no . i sell cars . that ' s all ! not even foreign cars . nothing international , i swear . i ' m no terrorist . everything i said was a lie . you have to believe me . i ' m actually a complete coward . if i ever even saw a gun i ' d -- <continued_utterance> -- faint . <person> ! <person> ' t kill me . i ' m not a spy . i ' m nothing . i ' m navel lint . i have to lie to women to get laid . and i don ' t score much . it ' s pathetic . <person> , look . would a spy pee himself ?
what ' s wrong with this world ? there are sick people out there ! <person> ' son of a bitch like that takes up my time . cuts into the amount of hours i have available to deal with other people interested in my wares ! there ' s no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country .
they don ' t make our job easy , <person> .
they ' re all good , sir .
oh , okay , then i can take this kind .
<person> ' s just say mr . <person> and i have a conflict of interest . i want to see this airline work . . the figures here show it can .
. and you ' re prepared to take these large salary cuts .
i don ' t know ! what ' s `` omnipotent '' mean ?
work with me -- i ' m just speculating here . <person> ' s call this force `` <person> '' ; and let ' s say this `` <person> '' is controlling everything . <person> wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil .
he loved that track .
get a grip , skippy . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s dead . and ain ' t no requiem gon na resurrect his ass . he down under the ground now with the real men of respect .
that ' s part of growing up , honey .
what ? having spring break ruined by will readings ?
do you know what this is ?
it ' s my father ' s . it ' s his regimental pennant . how did you come by this , sir ?
never .
when he looks at you , do you forget how to breathe ?
you got that right .
probably up a pole starving itself to death .
great . he ' s revolutionizing the place . no one is allowed to work in his department who doesn ' t have a ph . d . in children ' s literature .
i love daisies .
he didn ' t want anyone to know . he kept it out of the papers . he said a third wife was bad for his image . you ' ve got to protect me !
go to my hotel room . i ' ll be there in twenty minutes .
reilly turns to lindenmeyer .
where ' s the sheila <number> . <number> module ?
well , just relax , will ya . you ' re makin ' me nervous . <continued_utterance> so , <person> still hasn ' t called yet ?
<person> ' him a taste of his own medicine . <person> .
but , but . she changed your life .
yup . and now i ' m gon na change hers .
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and <person> out of trouble was to send us to big daddy ' s farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama ' s hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . <person> will never have to bust his knuckles like we did .
i want <person> to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
that makes mom the czarina . i ' m a czarette . <person> . <continued_utterance> none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar .
<person> --
well , then , you ' ll have to walk . the munchkins will see you safely to the border of munchkinland . and remember , never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment , or you will be at the mercy of the wicked witch of the west .
but , how do i start for <person> ?
please ! and take it with you !
oh -- thank you so much ! now we can go back to the wizard and tell him the wicked witch is dead !
when you get back to the united states , i want you to give this ball to <person> for me . he is from <person> .
<person> is dead ! <person> has disappeared ! the guardia has the church , and we need you !
i love you .
have a nice bachelor party .
we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty . we wanted to showcase women throughout the world .
next time , make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold .
well , i guess i could use some help getting this box into the house . not far . you could shower , get something cool to drink .
well , i could use something cool .
i like that about me , beautiful .
it ' s <person> .
for you ! i don ' t even know why -- <continued_utterance> whoever i was , i must have been a helluva guy .
`` whoever you were '' ? ? ?
<person> no , baby . i wouldnta done that without tellin you .
that bastard <person> .
you lost a sale , <person> . the hudsons ' loan didn ' t go through .

take her to the boat .
you can ' t do that yourself ?
hell no , i can ' t do that myself . i ' m blind . <person> ' t you see that ?
yeah , they arrived about ten minutes ago .
<person> ! what a homecoming !
so who are you ?
bond --
<person> ' s nice .
they ' re all nice , but <person> keeps rushing me , keeps talking about marriage . and i don ' t really want to get married -- not now anyway .
jesus . it ' s slower than hell .
<person> , but it weighs better than thirty tons . no way they could stop it .
i ' m terrible at this . i blurt . i ' m a blurter . your parents . they . well . they exist no further . skinny-dipping . the amazon .
you ' ve got the wrong guy . the closest my parents have been to the amazon is the brazilian pavilion at epcot .
i ' m sorry she never got her miracle .
she did . it was you .
i thought i loved her .
chicks are like buses . if you miss one , don ' t sweat it . there ' s another coming ' round the corner . <continued_utterance> take your pick . they ' re identical .
just insecurity . <person> crunching gut splinters .
what does that mean ?
when do you think all this smiting is going to go down ? we may have some friends there .
accompany me .
well , i ' m glad you did .
i don ' t know what ' s gon na happen to moe .
it ' d make their heads explode .
<person> , man .
there ' s blood all over his house , seems to belong to him . there ' s just no body . not yet .
i don ' t feature <person> for it .
yeah .
i ' m not surprised you made the tournament , brendan . you got some stones .
this was that guy ?
<person> , i told you i ran into another tin man .
it ' s a place called <person> ' s <person> . the address is <number> north east <number> . it ' s under your name .
and what ' s the mysterious code word ?
good . i ' m good .
you are ?
all in good time , my little pretty -- all in good time .
oh , please give me back my dog !
if there was some way i could make it up , believe me , i would , because you know where i stand . <continued_utterance> you know where i stand , wing . if there was any way , believe me , i ' d make it up . i ' d give you thirty percent of what you didn ' t get because it was a fluke . i ' m willing to make some kind of retribution .
you just pocketed the god damned money . you just took my money and slipped it into your god damned pocket , didn ' t you ?

he ' s not at <person> ' s .
no way <person> . not like this .
<person> , steps up , it ' s a corker down the pipe . <continued_utterance> it ' s outta here !
i know , i was wrong . but <person> , <person> , we got to get out .
<person> to yourself , <person> . <person> and crawl or you might get <person> ? what kinda talk is that ? that ' s <person> lyin ' over there , <person> . our own brother . <person> life . no sir , i ain ' t going no place . you want to go , fine . i ' m stayin ' right here and have it out with those bastards . <continued_utterance> how much you wan na bet ?
last show i worked , one bull faked a belly ache just to get the whiskey . <person> grab the hook .
are you a bull man ? august would hire you in a minute .
see here , this is queens . all the way round here , australia . you can ' t get any further away before you start coming back . y ' know , there ' re still places in australia where no human being has ever set foot .
so when are you leaving ?
i know . it ' s nuts . and he quit after his freshman year .
why ?
<person> .
keith do not trivialize this .
i did .
a single hour .
are you <person> ?
no , i ' m not .
<person> at you , the mighty thor . <continued_utterance> stop ! what are you doing ? ! <continued_utterance> if you destroy the bridge , you ' ll never see her again !
forgive me .
<person> , i ' m just guessing .

you think that ' s wise ?
um-huh . and guess what else ? i have toys .
' <person> , forty-nine . lives in arlington , still working at the hospital . ' can you get out tomorrow ? how come she isn ' t speaking up .
right .
just keep making pars , asshole .
i ' ll take eighteen of ' em .
something you obviously have a hard time doing !
hold that thought .
mints ?
copped a tin of altoids at the car wash . dom nods , satisfied .
if you manage to seize an inconceivable <number> percent of all drugs coming into this country , you ' ll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than <number> percent which won ' t affect drug use at all .
why are we calling this a war at all ? you don ' t declare war on your own people . addiction is a little worm that gnaws a house apart from the inside .
does she want to hear it was one of her professors ?
i ' ve got tenure .
or we could just start there .
it ' s worth a look , i suppose .
the truth . i just left you out of it .
when did you build this ?
you never were a team player . that ' s why you never had any friends .
i have plenty of friends .
oh , yeah , i remember something about that . a greek doctor .
that ' s right . that ' s the one .
she ' s in a wheelchair ? !
<person> ' t look so shocked , it ' s been a long time . i bet you ' ve changed a lot over the last twelve years , haven ' t you ?
yes , mom --
then here ' s a little bump .
not really . no .
not a problem . understand not my words , but follow my orders . follow my orders
why is that ?
my father was executor of the inventor ' s estate and he refused to liquidate it . i often chided him on that account , but he felt positive that the owner would return some day . - some people hereabouts think it ' s haunted . who are you , sir ?
you can drop the act , it ' s over .
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about !
really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
i think i can find my own way back to into town .
did you come home during the day last week ?
no .
mine . <continued_utterance> i got ta get out , <person> .
<person> ? outta what ?
<person> , sure . with only an infinitesimal chance of permanent spinal paralysis . i ' ve read all about it .
it ' s your chosen profession , geek . <continued_utterance> there ' s an intimacy involved in playing existenz that is beyond description . it has to be experienced . and frankly , the two-player version is the most exquisitely intense . <person> ' t you like to play with me ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> look !
what is it ? what ' s the matter ?
can you make it back up ?
<person> -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope . it should reach down here . go get it , throw it down .
what do you mean ?
here . read this .
well , i ' m not on drugs . but i might be crazy . <continued_utterance> oh my god , <person> ! ! ! i can ' t believe it ! i just really can ' t believe it ! i mean . whoa !
oh , thelma . oh , no .
what would you like it to be to me . ? i , i , i can ' t invest in failure .
excuse me , i ' ve .
you are so sweet to that guy , you really are . <person> not wanting to drag him into this . he is a lucky man .
i didn ' t ask him to come ! it ' s like i said , thelma , he just loves the chase .
i ' m on the way with a team to relieve you . what ' s the latest ?
they retrofitted <person> with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it , light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that `` classified '' stuff you didn ' t want me to know about . does the song `` <person> '' mean anything to you ?
we ' re going to get off , all right . we ' ll get you off of there . just . be cool .
where you going ?
all i know is , you killed your girlfriend and i don ' t know what ' s in your mind .
i need your help .
i ' m choking on it . <continued_utterance> <person> ? ummm . do you want me to come with you ?
oh . now . it ' s probably not such a good idea right now . i ' ll . catch up with you later , on down the road .
spirits have a way of bringing that out .
and being sixteen .
theyandiacute ; re all asking how youandiacute ; re doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ? <continued_utterance> why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will .
what ? . miss me ? <person> , iandiacute ; m gon na walk out the front door and trust me , it wonandiacute ; t be soon enough for everyone here . <person> pulls a duffle bag out of the closet . logan can i , umm ?
i ' m sorry . i didn ' t mean that . where are you going ?
do out there , what you did in here .
with all my heart .
kiss me . ?
the first three we opened were .
really ? any chance that some of the others . ?
and who will stop me ? the elements are slaves to my command !
there is no one who can match your sorcery . except me !
you approved the decision .
but not the timing of the matter . i intended to address them myself , explain the situation .
and what ' re you gon na tell <person> this weekend ? you gon na say you wouldn ' t join the scouts because . him didn ' t wike his widdle uniform ? <continued_utterance> ' no boy given over to dissipation or negativity can stand the gaff . he quickly tires and gives up . he is the type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment . he can not take punishment and come back smiling . '
all right , but this stinks .
you are a sad strange little man and you have my pity . <person> .
oh , yeah ? well , good riddance , ya looney ! <continued_utterance> rendez-vous with <person> .
investment ?
<person> hundred acres ? enough for two resorts , don ' t you think ?
well . i like it . because even in this little town , i feel like what i do is very connected with the real center of people ' s lives . i ' m not saying i ' m always mr . <person> , but i don ' t feel like my life is off to the side of what ' s important . you know ? i don ' t feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people . i don ' t feel like a negligible little scrap , floating around in some kind of empty void , with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies i can scrape together on my own .
well --
<person> . you know .
oh . something to eat . si .
the report . i ' ll never .
oh my darling .
she ' s in high school . she ' s sexually active . she ' s on drugs . she ' s crying out for some help .
you ' re describing half the high school girls in america . what is she doing right now ?
consider me ungrateful .
it ' s i who should thank you -- for taking that money back to mi- <number> . so distressing for m . an explosion inside her lair .
you ' re lying .
am i ?
to see ?
if she .
youre scarin me , baby .
well , theres a good side as well as a bad side to it . the good side is i knew your daddy , and i thought <person> was a good ol guy .
<person> .
i ' m a full-blood <person> .
what do we owe our governments ? yours kidnapped you , mine abandoned me .
<person> , this ain ' t about the people that sent us here , you know that .

get away ! get away ! <continued_utterance> you ' ll die ! you ' ll die ! <continued_utterance> who are you ! who are you !
i ' m <person> . i ' m here to find fin <person> .
i ' m looking for anything out of the ordinary . maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found .
we weren ' t expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington .
you forgot your keys !
oh . thanks .
i dunno . all my things are back at nellie ' s -- the other side of town . i know what i could do , i ' ll go back to the house . there ' s still a few things i left behind . at least i can get a change of clothes .
i ' m glad this is working out .
<person> naked is no big deal . it has nothing to do with emotion , nothing to do with love . you can be around all the naked girls you want and you won ' t be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life . <continued_utterance> see that ? you don ' t know me even one ounce better than you did before . you and your stupid magazine . i liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human , like the rest of us .
yes ?
tell it to the dolphin , goodall .
everybody deserves a second chance , ya know ? we ' d do the same for you <person> .
you own this place ?
yep .
<person> . the gopher !
hey , don ' t i have any rights ?

you ' re breaking my heart .
the worst thing about you , <person> , is you realize the futility of what you ' re doing and you do it anyway . i wish you could see how transparent you are . this food tastes like shit .
<person> ! what do you think you ' re doing ! i tell the planting seeds in this village .
i told him we didn ' t steal it , wil- low .

from the magazine ?
this is mr . <person> in subscriptions ?

the world is not driven by discounts , believe me . i ' ve been in business forever . i started helping my mother here after school when i was six years old . i used to watch her , and it wasn ' t that she was selling books , it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be . when you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does . i guess i ' ve gotten carried away .
you have , and you ' ve made me feel .

i told you about calling me boy . i ain ' t no boy . <person> , you and <person> got a bad habit of calling me boy . you call me boy in front of my wife . you think i ' m going to fix the roof ? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain .

<person> ' t be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .

she ' s doing a lot better than we are , <person> .
<person> <number> <person> --
<person> <number> . insights into my soul .

it was two wars ago , i believe . nineteen seventeen . warden why now i recall . the chap who inquired about my father -- and the house that used to be across the way . but no . that ' s impossible . you haven ' t changed . you ' re not a day older . and your clothes . <continued_utterance> i ' m afraid it ' s going to take me a little time to explain . you see . there is an insistent , ear piecing siren . it lasts for three seconds .
the last alert . hurry !
would you kill her ? <continued_utterance> because i ' m sick and tired of her little games . because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again . because i ' ve got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her , and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it .
i ' ve done a few things but i ' m not a murderer , mr . mckenna .
you actually listen to all those tapes ?
no , i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ?
medicinal marijuana initiative . or am i being cynical ?

you ' re telling me , but only because you never let me in on any of it . you ' re not going to see <person> , are you ?
then take me with you .
no . you ' ll be safe here .
you shouldn ' t be , <person> . i am no doubt culpable for <person> ' s actions .

why wouldn ' t you eat a fish eye , <person> ?
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle . he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble . his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing . and he couldn ' t swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn ' t get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver . i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . <person> ! it just stuck up there and spread out . it was about the size of a half dollar . and that ' s why i don ' t ever eat fish eyes . he plays the guitar for <person> . then stops . truman i ' m not saying it ' s right or wrong , it ' s just the way i feel . it ' s the custom thing i was thinking of . in america we don ' t use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides . we throw away the tail , the rest of the insides and the head .

fine you want to stay here ? <continued_utterance> officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple . completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .
what do you think ?
i think he ' s not the first husband you killed . i once knew a man , one of the counts of <person> . he told me a story . of beauty and danger . he was the bravest man i ' ve ever known . and the saddest .
`cuz <person> been whippin ' <person> ' s ass from the time he could talk .
what about the wife ? beat her too ?
you are the emperor of every little girl who dreamed of growing up to see her naughty bits spread eagle , airbrushed to glossy perfection , with staples through her ass .
you ' re the sultan of semen . the monarch of masturbation . the merchant prince of lust . you . ted .
i ' m not a big fan of heights .
i know . we erased what really happened from your memory .
we ' ll have to go after them .
<person> ' t you afraid ?
do you know dr . <person> . ?
i know of him .
but he has <person> now . she can handle it .
no , she can ' t . his guardian still has to make every single decision . it ' s the difference between a baby sitter and a parent .
which was a big mistake . i see that now . you think it won ' t be awkward the next morning but -- trust me , you just want to rip your eyeballs out . <person> , if you want to impress <person> , tonight at the feast , do the fertility dance with her , then drag her back to your hut .
my hut ' s a mess . and what if she struggles ?
the name ' s <person> .
<person> , would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night ?
you think i ' m kidding . you ' re the most fallible , wrong-headed , self- deluding , just generally benighted jackass i ' ve ever <person> . yet , withal , even at your worst , you ' re the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope .
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life .
that ' s what this is all about ? tell me , who ' s gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
not for long . we ' re retiring the red cars . <person> will drive , mr . <person> , because they ' ll have to . and when they drive , they ' ll have to buy our cars , our tires , our gasoline .
i know ! they both get quiet .
i don ' t want to talk about it ! thelma , i ' m not kidding ! <person> ' t you even .
no .
so - for an object to exist at all , it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion . and that fourth dimension is duration . time ! dr . hillyer all right ! but what ' s in that box ? <continued_utterance> i ' m coming to that . but first , consider ! why is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension ? because we have no freedom to move in it . we can move in the other three -- up , down , forward , backward , sideways . but when it comes to time , we are prisoners . do you follow me , <person> ?
no . never . <person> .
would you object if i answered it for you ?
i must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . you know , we have so much in common we have such history together i ' ve been thinking we should become friends . <person> ' s anxiety tanks are hitting capacity .
you and me have nothing in common .
there ' s got ta be something . we have to dig deeper .
you forget , i dislike you at least as much as him .
just sit here for a moment . you seem very upset .
<person> just pulls up out of the blue . i mean . what is this world coming to ?
no . i saw the man who killed him .
anybody know about this ?
oh , <person> . now , i happen to know progressive plywood is looking for an assistant editor . it would be perfect for your father .

while i appreciate your poetic sensibility , mr . mcavoy --
have you cancelled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet ?
you don ' t show for chicago , everyone ' ll know there ' s something going on .
you are my son . my blood . i wanted only to protect you from the truth .
because i am the monster parents tell their children about at night ?
i propose we get your father a job here in ukiah and you can come and live with him .
brilliant . not that i ' m fond of ukiah , but i ' d live in a drainage culvert to be with you .
toy ?
t-o-y . toy .
you don ' t expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job , do ya ?
hmm .
-until when ?
<person> votes on the floor of the city council in two days , ratifying the official start of construction on <person> stadium-
no . just like an hour or so .
what about the chairs ?
the name ' s gibbons . you were saying ?
what is this place ?
i ' ve been very lazy for a long , long time .
you seem like you ' re anything but lazy , <person> .
iandiacute ; m sorry . iandiacute ; m not like the rest of you -- iandiacute ; m tired of hurting people . she starts to cry now .
itandiacute ; s okay .
i ' m not sure i made the slightest difference . i tried . i really did .
there are a lot of encouraging statistics . the work ' s just started , but i intend to see it through . you ' ve got my word on that .
they ' re boxing us in with these rules of engagement . if you agree to ' em , and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won ' t stop for inspection , the chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting . they want a war , and they ' re arranging things to get one . if you don ' t want one , we have to do something about it .
how does a man get to a place where he can say , ' throw those lives away , ' so easily ?
but the others .
you can ' t help them now . your job is to survive . she struggles to sit up .
let ' s see , it closed at uh , <number> <continued_utterance> rising profits . strong balance sheets , good earnings per share .
so you ' re hot on this stock ?
<person> , i need money . <person> threatened my children . they want a first payment of three million dollars .
<person> , if i had it i would give it to you , but i don ' t have that kind of money .
<person> .
<person> `` <person> '' .
<person> , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
i see .

i just drove in this morning .
<person> into superior ? what for ?
tell me about the letter .
take a look at this . <person> and i found it under <person> ' ring fingernail .
i don ' t know what you ' re asking ?
you ' re skill .
but we ' re not on my planet , are we ?
no .
i thought we ' d have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails .
but the captain ordered you hard to starboard .
i ' ve always been a collector at heart . when i see something i want , i have to have it .
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
how the hell do these tape things work ? hold her for chrissakes !
my arms are getting tired .
i didn ' t know you were a jane austen fan . not that it ' s a surprise . i bet you read it every year . i bet you just love mr . <person> , and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really , honestly and truly going to end up together .
would you please leave ? <continued_utterance> please ?
yes .
how is she ?
well , why not ? i ' m feeling magnanimous tonight . the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . i ' m retiring to take a new role in the private sector .
<person> ? well , don ' t expect the toons to give you a gold watch . <continued_utterance> here you go , kid . say hi to casper for me .

you mind if i have a quick smoke ?
the <person> boy saw him , <person> . i ' ll make it , but <person> and the homicide department off my back or they ' ll blow the whole thing .
when word gets out that <person> was a cop , all hell will break lose . you ' ve got <number> hours . that ' s all i can give you . <number> hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department . <continued_utterance> tell you what . why don ' t you and that blonde what ' s-her-name come over for dinner sunday . how ' bout that .
<person> , i ' m not going anywhere . not yet anyway .

it seems we ' re short on singers .
everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen . it lets everyone know you ' re in sync . it shows unity , that all thoughts are one . a crew that sings together stays together . besides , i like it . so , pipe up and be sailors .

it doesn ' t matter . you ' ve forgotten about that boy , <person> . you got scared . just because something happens , doesn ' t mean you can ' t take another chance in your life .
i don ' t understand .

now <person> is dead . he got his revenge .
he ' s not through yet . <person> doesn ' t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there ' s more coming in . he ' s working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against king . and you .
she looks like a moth , <person> .
a moth ?
<person> reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable . he wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was brains . there was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches . <continued_utterance> it ' s that nut of yours .
what do you want ? no . nothing happened to him .
that ' s right .
<person> , do you remember a carswell fensterwald ?
you better be careful . you ' ll get a stroke arguing .
i wouldn ' t care if i drop dead if he learn something from it . <person> , you make me wish i was dead .

i said out of respect . <person> for you fisher . for you and your wedding and your beautiful bride . there will be no more rain . you see where i am here ?

why you sly dogs , he was right ! i want to say that if more wisdom , or more empathy , or more pure intelligence exists than exits in this man , i want to know about it . do you know that he actually had me sleep here last night ? in his jamies , using his toothbrush !
that ' s a very unusual technique .
a promise .
ja .
and you ; you ' ve got it all together .
i don ' t want it this way . i wouldn ' t kill you just to kill you , but i can ' t let you lose the gold for me . not when we ' re so close .

in a word : merk . exposed .
that ' s two words . and i ' m out of the `` exposed '' business , remember ? i need to graduate . besides , <person> ' s a boy scout .
why can ' t i come with you ?
because if you ' re such a baby you got ta tell your mommy about us playin ' pool when i totally asked you not to , and i got ta listen to her shit all day , then you ' re goin ' to the baby-sitter ' s so you can stay at the baby house .
you ' re kidding me ?

<person> check everything the chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it . no one ' s to know about this but <person> . i need redundant control over what happens out there . and if things aren ' t as advertised , you ' re going to make sure they come out the way i want them to come out , starting with this low level flight thing .

so i do not misunderstand you : there are no offensive weapons in cuba .
it ' s in between us and them ! ! how we going to get back ? !
i can ' t hear you .

i don ' t give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there ' s only one way to do that .
bad examples . <person> , <person> , i don ' t want to depreciate the loss here , but perhaps -- in a sense- this -- is for the best . <person> ' s eyes shift , study crabtree .
kind of a sign , you ' re saying .
do any other daikinis ever come by here ?

i heard <person> on the news again tonight -- i don ' t know : i hate the democrats and the republicans , but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn ' t seem like . . a liar .
<person> -- the senator from rome .
well , yeah , they do . but there ' s definitely peeling involved too . i saw it on discovery health . if more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife .
laser .
when all is done , we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds . then i , the bastard son , will have accomplished what <person> and <person> never could .
this is a great day for <person> .
i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
you never said anything . about the drapes .
<person> , i don ' t want to have to take you in for questioning . you ' ve got his car , you were the last to see him
i don ' t know where he is .
excuse me , mr . <person> ! can you sign an autograph for our grandson ?
can ' t you see i ' m busy ? ! i ' m working ! this is my office ! do i come to your office and ask you for an autograph ? ! <person> . he practically stiff-arms them as he passes , heading up to the clubhouse . they stand there in shock . <continued_utterance> who the fuck these people think they are .
still , you were right about the celebration . and when the cardinal told me how much it meant to you .
i said nothing .
is the tape on ?
of course .
there ' s a depraved thought . you ' re so delightfully low . <person> filth .
thank you , your majesty .
what ?
tell me that wouldn ' t sell it . plus he ' s a communist .
see how polite he is ? he was really nice .
you cheer up now !
<person> . we ' ll work it out .
well . i could use a beer .
what about the water .
you bought her some time , <person> . <person> ' t never gon na be over . but you bought her some time .
you don ' t have to do that .
yes , i do . you ' re right . i can ' t just let him go free . besides , i can help you from the inside .
what are you doing ?
it ' s nothing to do with you .
private , you will do as you are told . <continued_utterance> hook him up .
as you see , sir , this one is stronger .
look , i loved `` exposed ! '' and i hate it that you got busted . i know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it ' s really not that bad .
<person> ' t even tell me you ' re hot for <person> over there .
why am i looking at pictures of people i don ' t know ?
because that ' s my family .
twenty-four isn ' t young . i ' d already been goin ' out with him ten years when we got married . i ' ve never been with anybody but <person> .
well , if you don ' t mind me sayin ' so , he sounds like a real asshole .
your old friend <person> appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime <person> took off with someone else .
how did you know ?
but , <person> , that <person> was mine .
and <person> ' s your dog . <person> , i trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog , and all you can do is piss and moan .
it ' s more emotional damage . it wasn ' t very serious physically . <continued_utterance> nothing like when i sent you to the hospital .
what was that ?
you are americans , yes ? <continued_utterance> we didn ' t not all want this war , do you know ? we didn ' t not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in kuwait . now your army crushes us . so few days , and so many have died . and many fear we will all die . <person> tell this to your people : we did not want this war . <continued_utterance> i have a brother in our army . when i take you back , will you look for him ? if he is still alive , will you look for him and take care of him ?
yeah . we ' ll look for him .
i ' m not a referee . i won ' t do it .
oh , we know , we know : the bride won ' t argue . the bride won ' t raise her voice .
we ' re not really that insulted --
take it back !
no . i ' ve done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt . like , he was built . you know .
he was large ? <continued_utterance> did you try to fight him ?
it ' s his father sir . he ' s suffocating him . we ' ve all seen it . <continued_utterance> i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn ' t even know who his own kid is . what right did then have to show up here ?
they have every right <person> .
what was he doing in the rec room ?
well , after i worked on him -- thought i ' d let him rest . left the room for a bit . when i came back , he was gone .
not at all . it ' s a much more organic approach to gaming than classic , arbitrary , rule- dominated games . it ' s the future , <person> . you ' ll see how natural it feels .
<person> at this . could this be the future too ? ever see anything like this before ?
the last month maybe .
how long have you been smoking marijuana ?
no sides ?
no .
she ' s crying .
<person> , every time i try to put her back to bed .
oh , how inappropriate is that !
take a whiff of heaven .
good . i got stuck at the office with a client .
i know , <person> called . oh , i dropped off the fan at leo ' s today .
<person> .
they took it down , set fire to it , and threw it on the doorstep of room <number> at the buffalo butte motel . your room . <continued_utterance> we traced the number of the truck that dumped it , and it belongs to one <person> , also known as <person> . she ' s been all over the res , riling up the traditionals , telling them not to break , and to keep <person> in hiding . she ' s a problem now . and she ' s yours . get her off the reservation .
he could identify me .
if it concerns you . kill him . <continued_utterance> let ' s toast this <person> . we ' re in his hands now .
i know he does . <continued_utterance> are you mad at me ?
listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely don ' t regret . is the choice . i made to be your mother . <continued_utterance> i miss you .
you could have told me what i was from the beginning . why didn ' t you ?
you are my son . my blood . i wanted only to protect you from the truth .
and if i resist . ?
i will kill you with my bare hands .
this is <person> , <person> . this is <person> to joy .
my apologies , mr . renaissance man .
what are you going to do ?
i don ' t know .
you shouldn ' t be smoking .
i know . but if i do .
are you alright ?
i think i ' ve really fucked up . i think i ' ve got us in a situation where we could both get killed . why didn ' t we just go straight to the police .
not from forty feet . <continued_utterance> the disposable lighter also contains a small self-detonation charge depending on who - or what - you wish to dispose of . <continued_utterance> stop fidgeting , <number> . <person> - he takes out a pair of shoelaces .
. shoelaces ?
so you ' re basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i couldn ' t do it .
well , think of it as playing a role . it ' s fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
well , i think he is .
how would you know ? did you ever meet him ?
gee , <person> , you ' re not gon na go , are ya ? <person> ' ll be layin ' for ya at nine o ' clock .

i ' m up to speed , <person> .
are you . an architect ?
well , just until i get my pga tour card . <person> stares at him , mouth agape . healy i ' m kidding . <person> , i guess you could call me an architect -- it ' s just a job really , a way to keep me moving . my real passion is my hobby .
that ' s exactly what i ' ve been thinking ! you wouldn ' t believe the things that have been happening to me lately . i just didn ' t know why .
i know why . to bring you here -- to this place -- to me .
er , skinny , i think .
uh oh .
you should have killed me when you had the chance . but you couldn ' t . not me . a woman you ' ve loved .
you meant . nothing . to me . <continued_utterance> one . last . screw ?
and you are an old man and a fool !
a fool , yes ! i was a fool to think you were ready . <person> takes a step towards <person> imploringly .
what do you mean ?
her left arm . it was numb . she said she couldn ' t use it . said it had no feeling . probably from the drugs she was taking . i just thought i ought to tell you .
<person> , sir . i ' ll discuss this with the broker and i ' ll get back to you . you ' re welcome . <continued_utterance> if i ' m closing out this account . if he doesn ' t pay for it tomorrow , you pay for it .

yeah ?

besides an apology ?
tell me again , franklin , why are we here ?
for the waters . are you coming ?

no .
what do you think ? guess .
it ' s hard to believe they haven ' t heard of the great porthos .

and then you weren ' t there .

yeah . <person> . i forgive you . but i do not trust you . tell <person> this is where i am if he wants to see me .
<person> --

nourish is a double agent for cortical systematics . he was working with <person> to subvert the realist cause , and doing it rather well . <continued_utterance> after all , he got you to assassinate your own contact . but now you ' re going to put a stop to him .

my friend , if you ' re planning on crossing me .
what ' s on it ?
a little <person> , little <person> , little <person> , little this , little that . and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick i ever met .
admittance form is wrong .
forget it . you can ' t prove it . <person> ' s testimony is no good . <person> knows we win she gets the cash .
yes .
did he come in with you ?

she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you ' re afraid of the responsibility .
' bout ten frames . <person> ' ll you see the pictures -- you look great .
i ' ll bet i look great -- give me the film .
<person> , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
we kidnapped <person> out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ?
how sweet .
my timing always was lousy .
yeah . we ' re making it worse !
no we ' re not . <person> up .
i came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out . well how am i supposed to meet someone ?

i snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . and when i woke up in the hospital . somehow it hadn ' t . <person> now .
it was last year . we were having troubles .

<person> , why should the datin game be different from real life ? at least them boys is gon na get somethin to eat .
you reached down into death . now , isn ' t that right ?
my god , we tried to save her . you can ' t know . you can ' t know .
am i ? where ' s <person> ? you can ' t file murder charges without a corpse . who knows this ? cops know this- you would know this .
-i ' m going to the review board and have you cited for- -keep him off balance . big curveball-
i don ' t understand .
you will after tonight . <person> on it .
i ' m writing a letter .
with a picture in it ?
i think you ' d better go on home , <person> . you ' ve fallen in .
no . not this time . this is the case that makes up for a whole career . if you can ' t understand it now , you will in a few years .
i know about business being bad .
yes sir . well , so we figured as long as we had the opportunity we ' d do a little rehearsing . <person> here .
then i ' m sure you can do it again .
and i ' m sure i can sue you for violating my constitutional rights !
oh no , they told you ? i fibbed a little but . <person> ' t be mad . oh . <continued_utterance> the fam .
i think you know , <person> , that your behavior is entirely inappropriate . we talked about trust . we talked about my needs . i want you to get on a bus and go back to new york .
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by <person> many years ago . her name is <person> .
you need a warrior for this job .
take a vacation .
i ' m on vacation ! !
come on . i know better than that - <continued_utterance> it must do something .
well . if you insist .
all we can do now is hope our plan works .
you think the cops have our phone bugged ?
what ?
if you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house , blow it into the phone hard , next time he calls . probably break his eardrum . he won ' t bother you after that .
. rings a bell somewhere . so what ?
a comer . <number> medium-body jets . <number> pilots , flies northeast , canada , some florida and <person> routes .
why ?
partly because i didn ' t want to hurt you . but partly . partly because i was relieved .
i ' m supposed to -- i got ta get <person> back her car .
well . i don ' t understand . how are we leaving things ?
first let ' s see if <person> ' s still out there .
<person> ' t he have a home to go to ?
i ' m doing a piece on skybolt . i hear <person> ' s meeting with him in nassau .
we ' re giving the brits polaris instead . but a story ' ll just aggravate things . <continued_utterance> not today . he ' s got tight schedule .
how do you know about that ?
it doesn ' t matter . you ' ve forgotten about that boy , <person> . you got scared . just because something happens , doesn ' t mean you can ' t take another chance in your life .
you lost ?
yeah .
yes , it ' s fresh !
just asking , florence .
can we contain him long enough ?
i think so . <continued_utterance> he flies at night . <person> cloud cover to disorient him . hopefully we ' ll knock him out with complimentary cocktails , pull the shades down during the movies . he ' ll never know .
what ' s he doing out there ?
i ' m sort of helping him work through some issues .
you didn ' t step on any mine .
i heard it click .
but , <person> , i missed the plane .
<person> , but now i have to go .
well , mother , he is sitting in his own bowel movement .
that ' s no excuse .
no .
then what do you think he was trying to do .
what ' ll it be ?
<person> ' er up .
<person> ' t dismiss me because i sit in this chair !
get away from me .
and you still want it-
-bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent .
here we go again --
we will grasp the foreskins of our penises and cut therefrom the extra flesh .
i ' ve forgotten and i don ' t know why . did anything unusual happen with him ?
you ' re joking .
in the passenger car ?
yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?
it ' s borrowed .
it ' s a good fit .
come on -- come on . <continued_utterance> where do we go now ?
yeah .
yes . i wrote it .
' practice and methodology in anaesthesia . ' general textbook on the subject . is that correct ?
that ' s a crappy thing to say .
<person> . i ' m cool with everything . you ' ve long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . you ' ve always had an itch for the good life . i ' m happy for you . this couldn ' t happen to a nicer guy . <continued_utterance> but just for the record , my <person> is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my <person> is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas . you seem to have forgotten they opened <person> ' s family market so they could build something permanent , a legacy , for us . their kids .
i ' m just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my mind , remember ? thanks for the lemonade . <person> turns to leave .
you never did answer my question .
what if every country legalized at the same time ?
somehow , i don ' t see that happening .
what is it . the secret ? <continued_utterance> what ?
if it were only that simple , my young friend . <person> on , gentlemen .
on my life , i promise you i will .
if you ' re lying , i ' ll hunt you down and kill you myself .
this fucking pervert just came on to nance !
all right , just be cool .
-fuck off . this is handled . and pull your idiot partner out of there-
-junior ' s already here-
no one ' s asking anything of you !
of course they are !
<person> , please . <person> ' t do this to me .
it ' s got nothin ' to do with you , <person> . it ' s-
i ' m afraid i ' m a little rusty yet .
oh , dear -- that was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you couldn ' t come to <person> with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart .
yeah , we ' re beat .
hey , where is everybody ?
i know , you ' re incredibly busy .
<person> . i ' ve raised my rate . i might even cut my sessions to forty minutes .
i didn ' t mean to hurt you , <person> .
you never do . you live your life skimming the surface . never aware of the attachments beneath . it must be a luxury .
what is that supposed to mean ?
the room looks wonderful , dear .
how can i reach you ?
you can ' t .
guilty on a reduced charge . <person> dollar fine and ordered to desist . pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place . you seen it . <person> filth . <continued_utterance> its a serious situation . not like the turks and the armenians , maybe , or the <person> and the jews , but i want people to remember me and what ive done and pick up where i left off . <person> had to make a move . it was nice meetin you folks .
what lesson do get outta that story , <person> ?
<person> . i can ' t drive a car .
you can now . <continued_utterance> get on in and i ' ll teach ya ' ! <continued_utterance> that one there is your brake .
a remarkable woman . the most beautiful i ' ve ever known . and the deadliest . which would explain my attraction . how is our young daredevil holding up ?
he ' s wishing he ' d never heard of the musketeers .
<person> ! it ' s not even one o ' clock yet . how long you been married now ? what is it ? twelve . twelve years ?
sixteen .
we ' re gon na die ! ! ! we ' re all gon na die !
excellent point . as you might have noticed , being out here pretty much puts you in the moment . if you panic , if you lose your head , you die . maybe you take your mates with you . how ' d you like to have to bet on <person> here getting us home today ? each one of you is responsible for the rest . `` where we go one , we go all '' . if your buddy is asleep at the switch we ' re all fish food . <continued_utterance> the ship beneath you is not a toy and sailing is not a game . the <person> will take us far gentlemen , but she demands constant attention . respect her , and we ' ll do fine . oh , and one more thing . there is nothing that goes on , on this boat that i don ' t know about . she speaks to me in the night . so don ' t test me . not even a little . <continued_utterance> nothing like experience to put things in perspective . huh son ? alright . <person> ' s go home .
he ' s smooth , right ? he probably has mistresses in every european city , too .
it ' s really a shame you ' ve scared him off -- she tosses some euros on the table . <continued_utterance> the two of you make a nice couple .
maybe she ' s hungry ?
well , what are we s ' posed to do ?
i think we just need to get wasted .
i wan na live at the beach someday .
this is where i stand up for all the little guys everywhere who ' ve had their fill of soulless robots like <person> --
he may be a soulless robot but he ' s a rich , happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who ' s got you by the huevos -- besides , how is getting into the u . s . open gon na change what she thinks about you ?
we ' re taking the body back to portland and there ' s not a thing you can do about it .
maybe not _a_ thing , but maybe _two_ things .
<person> ' s house . <person> ' s house . what ' s the difference .
oh , <person> , you ' ve had a big fall .
nothing . there was . i thought i saw something .
is it gone ? <continued_utterance> come on , let ' s go back to bed .
i know , <person> called . oh , i dropped off the fan at leo ' s today .
thanks for doing that . <continued_utterance> i ' ll be right back down .
that ' s the holy of holies -- you have to go in there and talk to the gods .
the gods are in there ?
then i guess <person> can kiss that arm of his goodbye . he don ' t use it for no good deeds anyway . <continued_utterance> you come all the way out here to watch <person> ?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
yes .
<person> , <number> rd precinct . i ' d like to ask you a few questions .
but what if they find out . god , they ' d put you in the gas chamber .
so if they ' re tapping your phone , we ' re dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you ' ll never see <person> . <person> ? i love you .
let go of me .
<person> ' t get near ' em . the plants ! they ' re alive . those things can imitate anything .
cool it , palmer ! !
read von <person> ! have you read von <person> ? get your facts straight !
how you feelin ' , <person> ?
rather an obvious question under the circumstances , don ' t you <person> ? a better one might be how do you feel ?
real magic , <person> , is simply the art of controlling the reality of others . you lack faith in your- self . you must learn to trust your intuition . <continued_utterance> go in the direction the bird is flying .
oh , if i could do that i ' d -- i ' d turn <person> into a toad !
where were they runnin ' to ?
a place called the stronghold . they died for a dream . but you live . you are their great-great grandchildren and you live . we have to honor their dream . of protecting the mother earth . and being proud of being indian .
you ' re a known hijacker . you ' re sweating like a guilty motherfucker . that ' s my p . c . save us the time . tell us where the truck is . <person> knocks on the table .
hello ? can you hear me in the back ? p . c . he looks under his chair . <continued_utterance> where is it ? i ' m lookin ' . it ' s not happening . what ' s going on with that ? i want
i want an article in the globe as soon as possible , ' st . <person> ' s . <person> serving the community ' etc . we ' ve got it in the files . i want something in monday ' s <person> : ' our gallant doctors , ' something . be inventive , i want television . . talk to our man at gbh . and to belabor the obvious for a moment . our clients are : the archdiocese of boston ; st . <person>herine laboure hospital , and <person> . <person> and <person> , two of the most respected men in their profession . the thrust of this defense will be to answer in court , in the press and in the public mind -- to answer the accusation of negligence this completely : not only that we win the case , but that we win the case so that it ' s seen that the attack on these men and this institution was a rank obscenity . all right . <person> ' s get the cobwebs off . billy . ?
please turn to your page four . <continued_utterance> we ' re going to start with a review of the depositions of the operating room team : the nurse-anesthetist , the scrub-nurse , the .

will you do me one favor ?
dont the reject guys get anythin ?
gift certificates to <person> .
i wouldn ' t be a proper girlfriend if i didn ' t nag every now and then .
i get it , but it makes me feel like the bad guy every time . which makes me feel like shit .
. and that you invited him to strike you ? to fight it out on the deck of your ship ? !
yes , that ' s true .
is that all right ?
yes , of course , sorry . i just think it ' s interesting . i don ' t know what i am , besides august ' s wife . i grew up in foster homes since i was a baby .
kelly ' s file . read it . you ' re going to find an angry , sexually confused girl who ' s made threats on her mother ' s life and a female lover she ' d never identify .
<person> ?
hey ! myeu-muh !
where did you find this ?
no , thank you . i don ' t like to lose control of my emotions . grady nods , accustomed to <person> ' weirdness . <continued_utterance> i ' m not supposed to be here , in case you were wondering . i crashed . i mean , not intentionally .
are you and hannah seeing each other , <person> ?
<person> me , but - i must formally protest this meeting . given the nature of what ' s occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force , the army , or mi- <number> . this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty ' s <person> .
admiral , are you suggesting -
otherwise whatever we ' re looking for could be anywhere .
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i don ' t think it ' ll be too hard to -- <continued_utterance> take cover ! <continued_utterance> let ' s hit ' em ! <continued_utterance> cover me . <continued_utterance> clear .
what if it hadn ' t been wes ? what if . i mean , accidentally , what if i had .
you shouldn ' t think about things like that . it ' ll just make you crazy .
we ' ve been watching you this entire time .
you saw those men try to kill me and you didn ' t intervene ?
<person> ? just how far did you intend to let this go ?
i don ' t know . i just wanted to hurt mr . <person> . <continued_utterance> he was my friend at first . then i got busted . he didn ' t even stick up for me . i had to go away to that hellhole . it ' s like , you ' re his favorite , then who cares ? you wan na know something ? when <person> said we should do this , i thought cool , all these big shots screwing me over , like that cop , <person> . now they ' re gon na get screwed .
there is no us , remember ?
except i can ' t get you out of my head , <person> .
<person> , that ozone layer is disappearin . <person> to me the government could do somethin about it . one of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an x-ray .
you okay , honey ?
<person> . <person> that winch there . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ?
fuck the winch . i wan na drive .

you ' re lucky somebody got to you first , madmartigan ! i ' d ' ve killed you myself after that stunt at land ' s end !
nesting ?
yeah . nesting .
oh right , the pediatrician .

<person> , people have religious experiences like on a lake or when they go up into the mountains , that kind of thing .
maybe . but i had mine in a smorgasbord .
we ' re not supposed to give out the number but i can call him and .
that ' s okay . i ' m sure we can find him if we need him .
someday , i ' ll find out .
you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip .
of course ! i promise ! <continued_utterance> come to daddy , little darlin ' . i think she likes me !
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she ' s either hungry or she ' s tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .
you ' re steppin ' on sign .
hey . hey , you , listen up --
what are you doing ? !
saving our lives !
who are you ?
we hung out last night , remember ?
questions , questions , mr . <person> . which i ' m afraid i ' ve neither the time , nor the inclination to answer . take them out to the jungle and -
i forgot to mention : the job comes with a car .
i aint fuckin sure , <person> .
<person> think about it too long . you had enough ?
<person> , i had no choice ! hand me the toast .
get the toast yourself .
fifteen .
<person> , fifteen .
no . no .
yes . we ' ve all got to let go .
why not ? you said you thought she was attractive .
so what ? who cares about <person> ?
what do i do . i ' m a key figure in an ongoing government charade . an annoyance to my superiors . a joke among my peers . `` spooky , '' they call me . <person> . <person> sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid . who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens and anyone who ' ll listen that the fix is in . that our government ' s hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy . that the sky is falling and when it hits it ' s gon na be the shitstorm of all time . she stares at him for a moment , startled by his drunken screed . she pulls back the shooter she ' s just poured <person> .
i think that about does it , spooky .
<person> .
and the lake ' s already polluted .
we want the dope . <person> .
and we want to give it to you . but the cops are tailing us nonstop . matter of fact , there ' s one right behind us now .
i ' ve got supreme confidence in you . <continued_utterance> <person> looks good , eh ?
everybody looks good in the tropics .
what does it mean for us ?
well , it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart -- or that you ' re going on a long sea voyage !
i feel like . we can do anything .
we can .
off a high-powered paraski that was trying to kill me .
the russian army , they spend millions on flying skis , but they can not afford to pay the soldiers . the men , they do what they have to do to feed their families . in this country , for the right price and a pack of cigarettes , you can get anything you want . <continued_utterance> that too . everyone does what they can to survive .
<person> --
why ? do you object to losing your head ?
<person> , please .

how long have i been here ?
two days .
you bought him ?
what ' d you pay for him ? <continued_utterance> how much , <person> ?
not today , <person> .
it ' s a matter of great importance to me !
you didn ' t have another vision . <continued_utterance> yeah , right here .
you take care .
<person> powerful words .
yes .
that ' s right . i agree . <person> .

that ' s <person> . do you know who that is ?
whatever you say <person> .
i ' m serious .

<person> ? you ' re fucking crazy . we are not invading <person> . nobody gives a rat ' s ass about <person> . not now , not ever . if you print something like that , all you ' re going to do is inflame the situation . nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations . <person> like that can find themselves cut out of the loop .

just because you got ' em to laugh ?
exactly . the morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating : nymphomaniac , criminal , communist . anything along these lines . once you visit the set of her `attack of the atomic vampires , ' you ' ll see the void that is her character . we haven ' t a photograph handy , but she ' s playing the lead female role .
i ' m happy to help . but my price is $ <number> , <number> . not <number> .

. <person> <number> , ' if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to <person> ? she aspirated into her mask ?
<person> , you have to deal with _all_ of this .
i ' m dealing with it , <person> . big time . maybe i ' ll make you a tape tomorrow .
it ' s weird , <person> , but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework .
i can see this stunt really has liberated your mind .

you ' re not going to believe this -- i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story . . exclusive . eat your heart out .
<person> , they dig him up and cart him back . he gets thawed out , wakes up and scares the shit out of them . and they get into one hell of a brawl .

i just told you ! to enter is instant death ! only i can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings .

i ' m ready . <person> stops , sees the two men looking at him . <continued_utterance> you all right , professor <person> ?
he ' s great . come on , let ' s blow before ol ' <person> decides to boil your bones for breakfast .
it feels like a storm has passed . <person> read some of <person> ' s letters to a woman he had a child by . the child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort . <person> didn ' t know that deep down at the bottom of <person> ' s hate , there was some love .
did i ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell ? he didn ' t want nobody ' s opinion but his own . <continued_utterance> he ' s going to check out heaven first . he gets a round trip ticket to heaven . he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home . people dripping with sweat , working in the fields , hardly surviving . he asked a man who was getting a drink of water , `` i thought the streets were paved with gold . `` `` they are but you won ' t see them , '' he said . `` boy , you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness . `` so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell . he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back , picking their teeth . `` man , this is a dream . `` he asked , `` what ' s you ' ll doing ? '' they all hollered back , `` sinning . `` the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said , `` please to meet you . `` he asked , `` i thought you ' ll was supposed to be burning in fire . `` <person> said , `` man , ain ' t no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins . `` the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth .

oh <person> , champagne completely overwhelms my senses . i always feel the better for it when i abstain . all i remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking . i don ' t even know how i got home . i don ' t remember a thing .
well , i want to apologize for --
how ' s that ? how many times has he been in here , busted you up ?
yeah , but he ain ' t got the salt to truly take a man ' s life . especially not <person> ' s . he was scared of him .
i ' m busted up for you , but <person> , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn ' t lift a finger .

<person> , <person> , i ' m closing my practice . most of my patients are on the west side but i have one case i ' d like to refer you .

it ' s like real life - there ' s just enough to make it interesting .
he ' s too nice . i won ' t do it .

something ' s wrong . <continued_utterance> . my pulse feels thready and i ' ve got a funny taste in the back of my throat .
what ' s gotten into you ? <continued_utterance> oh , still sore about this .
something your father would ' ve come up with .
yeah . what do you want . <person> , right ? have you ever been to california ?
yeah . grace is it far from here ? <continued_utterance> oh yeah . it ' s far , it ' s another world .
this is so sad .
you think that machine is your friend , but it ' s not . i ' m late .
someone wants to kill me , i ' d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
if this little show is for my benefit , i ' ll take you home right now .
i ' m sorry . i ' m probably wrong . i assumed that night after the raid was the first time you two fucked , but obviously it ' s been going on longer than that .
<person> , you ' re being silly .
may-i be frank , <person> ? i suspect your political power as much as i respect it . i don ' t know why mr . <person> has so many faceless allies in city hall , and i don ' t care . the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here .
immunity .
i got the shanks .
are you taking penicillin ?
<person> , it ' s okay . it ' s me . <continued_utterance> i was worried about you , <person> . i decided we should all get together , one more time , before we split up .
are you mad at me ?
where is she ?
she ' s here . she ' s just . <person> on a second .
no one knows much about them . but i knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation . shield showed up , and he was never heard from again .
i ' m not going to let them do this .
i once knew a man . one of the <person>s of <person> . my native province . when the good <person> was about your age , he fell in love with a visitor from paris . a breathtaking girl of seventeen . she was more than beautiful , d ' <person> . she was . intoxicating . and this man , the poor idiot , he married her .
<person> ' t that what people do when they fall in love ?
no .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! <person> away !
- that <person> may be involved with <person> and <person> , and the missing <person> .
<person> . <person> chatter from a source you can ' t identify - who insists on talking only to <number> . nothing but loose talk and innuendo .
i ' m waggling .
set up to the ball like i showed you last time .
they need leadership .
that ' s what i ' m saying . let the israelis straighten it up . they got plenty of room down there , number one . <person> , and this is just a plus , they kind of look alike -- the jews and the mexicans . so i think on a whole your average <person> is gon na have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing . am i right ?
hello , <person> . <continued_utterance> do you like my tomb ? the museum financing fell out , so i thought your clients might be interested .
it ' s certainly . dramatic .
i ' ve never been inside the vault before . it ' s said the tesseract was once held here .
the tesseract ? i thought that was but a legend too !
we are beyond diplomacy now , <person> . he ' ll get what he came for -- war and death .
so be it .
and she is the only living family , is that correct ?
yes , your honor , she is . but mr . <person> hasn ' t seen her for over twenty years .
<person> up a piece . not much , but us simple folk like it .
i ' ll be back in a couple of hours . and be careful with her , will you ? <person> slams down the hood .
you got me . but i think i know what they did with <person> .
i can ' t . <continued_utterance> i can ' t go any farther .
i ' m telling you , it ain ' t natural how she gets away every time .
she got to be hiding up on the slope ? you head up first and i ' ll follow with the flashlight .
funny you should say that . my grandfather was a peach farmer . ouch . for the first time , that really smarts .
he was my grandfather , too .
maybe we shouldn ' t .
then we ' ll never make it .
all i know . is i did what i did . and i ain ' t in solitary , gettin ' pumped up with downer , gettin ' beat to shit . but i tell you what , <person> . <person> me back . cuz i can ' t take this shit no more . <continued_utterance> man , i don ' t know who the fuck i am no more .
you and me both .
that ' s right .
<person> deal . <continued_utterance> is everything okay ?
thanks , iandiacute ; ll pay you back .
well if youandiacute ; re going to leave then you at least owe them a goodbye .
<person> , <person> . is there a problem ?
you wan na let me see your license , please ? <continued_utterance> you wan na take it out of your wallet , please ?

that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off , to hide something : bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself .

i have a lock on the door .
<person> , i ' m sorry , <person> . it ' s just --
<person> , the school district ' s not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs .
why do you want to have a child with me ?
that ' s not true .
then take my advice and go back to new york .
but i can ' t go anywhere ! i ' m all locked up !
<person> ' s settlement ? <continued_utterance> yeah , well , i told you they were gon na make us look stupid .
hey , don ' t back away from it , you were right . we did look stupid . what you were wrong about , is who made us look that way . <continued_utterance> think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . <person> had an affair with <person> , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for <person> to fabricate her charge in the first place .
what do you mean ?
<person> ' . forget it . <continued_utterance> you had a vision . you had yourself a vision . a man waits a long time for a vision . <person> go his whole lifetime and never get one . and along comes some instant indian with a mastercard and brand-new shoes , has himself a vision .
business hours are over , <person> . this is the switch .
i have to reach him . this is an emergency . could you give me his home number ?
he ' s sealed himself in .
he ' s going to insert the plutonium . <continued_utterance> do you know what you ' re doing ?
well , you
<person> right . <continued_utterance> i was upset . and i was horrible .
it ' s got iron in it .
oh . is that good or bad ?
<person> said how <person> murdered a man .
<person> , baby . your daddy never committed no murder . <person> been you didn't hear grandmama proper . he made some mistakes , is all . your daddy aint always been so lucky . <person> almost at the depot , honey . <person> back a minute .

but wait , you don ' t understand-
how long you been standing there ?
long enough .
all right , let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth ?
no .
uh huh ?
lets leave here .
i don ' t know why they ' re after me , but what ' s your connection with all this ?
we were together before .
<person> . what if i shove it up the wrong hole ?
<person> ' s grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous ; he imagines there are orifices galore down there .
a little .
so what are you doing out here ?
<person> , that ' s not nice . i ' m in church now .
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you weren ' t saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
he wouldn ' t like a lot of things . hop in .
he seemed pretty upset this morning .
ok . i ' m just gon na say what ' s on my mind . i want to be an assistant coach too .
seriously ?
why should it ?
thats right . take one of these .
<person> : i think it should be .
. but we don ' t tend to focus on that aspect of it , right off the bat --
dr . <person> , do you think you can help me ?
there ' s a saying , <person> , that the best psychiatrist in the world is right inside of you . i can help you , provided you ' re willing to help yourself .
after , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . dr . <person> called me in . he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he never looked at the admittance form . and he told me to change the form . he told me to change the one to a nine . or else , or else , he said . he said he ' d fire me . he said i ' d never work again . who were these men . ? who were these men . ? i wanted to be a nurse .
no further questions .
now , thelma , that is not .
<person> , he wasn ' t expectin ' that !
you do go all the way , don ' t you , little girl ?
sooner or later . <continued_utterance> you willing to go all the way ? huh ? you wan na do it for me . all the way for me means all the way - dead .
you ' re a pig . a happy-go-lucky pig .
no .
where did you get this ?
from my mother . <continued_utterance> it ' s true isn ' t , <person> ?
everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen . it lets everyone know you ' re in sync . it shows unity , that all thoughts are one . a crew that sings together stays together . besides , i like it . so , pipe up and be sailors .

<person> ?
no .
<person> .
<person> ! i knew it ! you ' re a vic- tim , <person> . <person> , you and me : victims of a rotten , corrupt , cor- rupt , rotten world . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> my friend . i ' m really a good man . give me my freedom , and i ' ll look after that baby for you . trust me . <continued_utterance> that ' s it -- good -- good -- like that , yes , good , good , the chain -- that ' s it , come on -- come on -- !

<person> ' t you ever say that word . or i ' ll never come over here and bring you chicken soup and fuck your brains out again .
i ' ll show you a badge when you open the goddamn door ! <continued_utterance> i don ' t carry a badge . i ' m issued a license , a piece of paper , and i left it at home . you ' re <person> ? <continued_utterance> can we sit down ? <continued_utterance> do you recognize this man ?

she ' s a transvestite .
you ' re stoned .
well , we ' ll see about that , d ' you have her phone number ?
whose phone number ?
so my wife is lying ?
<person> , think about it , if i was trying to rip you off , i would have left town after <person> was killed . i wouldn ' t sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal .
call the police . <person> , that ' s one option .
that is not an `` option . `` there is no multiple choice here .
so that clinches it . we ' ll never be together . i ' ll take care of these . he picks up a mango , squeezes it . joe i could never be with anyone who likes <person> . `` it ' s cloud ' s illusions i recall , i really don ' t know clouds at all . `` what does that mean ? <person> waits for <person> to say she likes <person> . but <person> doesn ' t say anything .

if you asked your girlfriend as a favor , would she do it with me ?
guys don ' t share their girlfriends .
and if i do , then what ? i love <person> more dearly than any of you , but you know what he is . he ' s arrogant . he ' s reckless . he ' s dangerous . you saw how he was today . is that what <person> needs from its king ?
he may speak about the good of <person> , but he ' s always been jealous of <person> .
maybe it ' s time to publish that story about his sex life . even things up . a close race is always better for our tv ratings .

i thought we could unite our kingdoms one day , bring about an alliance , bring about a permanent peace . through you . but those plans no longer matter .

<person> , look , many years ago .
fine , if you don ' t want us , stay with the scum in present management -- dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground .

nothing . nothing you don ' t know about . <person> ' s the big day . just have the car ready to go if i call or if the civil defense warning comes on .
what happens to you ? i ' m not leaving without you .
well she wouldn ' t . he left when she was twelve . never spoke about him after that . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t need the sound . you can pretty much tell what ' s happening by the faces . turn it up sometimes , though . <person> like someone ' s here . <continued_utterance> why are you here ?
i don ' t know .
yall take american express ?
yessir .
what about the king ?
he is not mentioned directly . but the agreement is contingent on a ' demonstration ' of the cardinal ' s power .
ask if he can check how many sick days i ' ve taken since i ' ve worked here ?
is that the entire message ?
<person> . your secret weapon right ? i mean , i know j . <person> is a slanted fuck , but traditionally `vicious fags ' don ' t make the best major case witnesses . i ' m worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility .
oh i don ' t need his testimony <person> . i ' ll just force yours .
help me . we have to seal it .
we ' ve got to get out .
what did you find ?
something i couldn ' t show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i ' d just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i ' ve never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
oh no ! oh please forgive me , <person> !
you broke her heart ! you broke your mama ' s heart . you stole me ! that ' s right . fuck it away . but it ain ' t ever goin ' away , cause your mama -- she ' s like a hungry ghost baby , she won ' t go away , she won ' t leave ya alone .
put him through .
go ahead , <person> .
i need to be alone .
you got it .
heard an argument , loud , maybe a minute or two , then silence .
what ' s this `peeper ' riff she ' s on ?
<person> . it ' s because you ain ' t got the baby batter in your brain any more . that ' ll fuck with your head , that stuff will .
huh .
this is everything , ain ' t it ? this is the choice it comes down to . this is our immortality .
no time to be thinkin ' ' immortality , ' cup . time to be thinkin ' <number> iron .
thanks . god , i hope they ' re not screwed up . i might have to bag the whole semester . <person> , sorry to bother you .
no problem . nice meeting you . hope you get it sorted out .
<person> palm , your girlfriend . god knows you spend enough fucking time with her . the guys laugh .
<person> , and who are you gon na take , your own palm ?
so maybe you ' ll get a different judge .
she ' s the only judge who handles these cases and if i look bad in front of her right now , i ' m screwed . i ' ll have to close my fricking doors .
<person> ' t call him a dipshit .
you do --
you got about six more big states to go before we find out .
we got through two states already .
nice to see you again mr . <person> .
try the steak tartare . it ' s off the menu but <person> ' ll make it for you .
you notice my new jumper ? <continued_utterance> my friends buy me clothes , so i don ' t look like trash .
i would hardly say you look like trash .
you ' re going to need this .
why ? --
math . history . science . <person> .
you wouldn ' t happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
i was afraid to go to <person> because of him .
all those places that us coloreds lived , that we used to call <person> , have all been changed to drives and <person> . everything is in what you call it , not in what it is .
yes . thank you .
then i will leave you .
were you guys that bad ?
<person> was average . i sucked . <person> .
starting to burn .
that ' s good . it means the circulation ' s coming back .
i never miss florida in the rainy season .
no letter ? no wire ?
really ? i think about it all the time . it ' s the hormones at work , you know .
wow . a second floor .
indictments . <person> time . whole nine .
<person> . is this true ?
yeah .
what ' s he doing up here ?
but you must buy your ticket and give your word that you ' ll go home . this is all about trust again , <person> . we must have trust .
i trust . i absolutely trust . i ' ll go buy my ticket . <person> now !
<person> ' t over yet . <person> is part of day ; separate , but equal . <person> is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
difference between you and me , old man , is i see the glass half full , you see it half empty .
what did she do ?
she didn ' t do anything . she took the patient ' s history and signed the charts . ' k . c . ' ' <person> . '
well , she sure as hell knows i ain ' t taking her to no doral for massages and mimosas all weekend . i got ta do something with my life . <continued_utterance> i got ta rise to a level worthy of the women that think i ' m a joke .
well . you could go out and win the open .
-out again . <continued_utterance> but if we see another mother from <person> ' s school , me name is <person> . i always wanted to be a <person> .
oh . <person> came to visit me at the center today .
i see what you mean . but wednesday we ' ve got to be back in new york .
all right -- so it ' s just for a couple of days . <person> ' t you want me to enjoy the winter sports ?
i mean . it ' s a disaster , <person> !
<person> .
only because i got pulled out early .
nobody else ever got anywhere near him . nobody else . understands him like you do .
that ' s right . i do , don ' t i ?
so why do you wan na go ?
<person> , let ' s forget it . <person> ' s forget the whole thing .
i get one hundred a day plus expenses .
what ?
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn ' t breathe ? that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?
well , i did work it out -- more or less --
then why ' re you running outta here in the middle of the day without a word of explanation to me , <person> ?
how ? what ? where ? when ?
a bit of <person> . we ' re not all stupid colonists .
maybe someday .
<person> , i ' ll tell you something that is the god ' s honest truth . i ' ve seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
does this look familiar to you ?
<person> waterhole ' s <person> . we could be there by mid-morning .
they ' re wise by now . <person> is <person> , <person> ? yeah , let ' s try there , <person> .
what does that mean ? !
it means you can do anything .
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .
i was invited . what ' s your story ?
but i just --
you are a lone reed . <person> looks puzzled . <continued_utterance> you are a lone reed waving in the breeze standing strong and tall in the corrupt sands of commerce .
you got no know-how . about indian way . or about jack <person> for that matter .
maybe you ' re not aware of this , <person> , but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods , psycholingusitics , dna fingerprinting ; i don ' t have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers . <person> was killed right here .
what is it , <person> ? your balls need scratching ?
your article sucked .
you have , and you ' ve made me feel .
she was . how did you know that ?
yes , i do . you ' re right . i can ' t just let him go free . besides , i can help you from the inside .
<person> ' t they gon na wonder were you ' ve been ?
<person> ?
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .
oh yes , i remember you .
<person> took us apart , but i knew it would bring us back together .
no . it ' s wonderful . it ' s something you ' d see on the wall of a steak-house in hell , but it ' s wonderful . sign it .
<person> ' s see yours .
. but what if i ' m not ? what if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can ' t move on while that ' s unresolved . <person> ' t you just . <continued_utterance> wow . <person> walks past him toward the parking lot .
<person> , please .
the last one ?
yeah .
i also called <continued_utterance> they told me they don ' t help out stalkers . <person> , maybe they ' re right , it ' s been a long time .
i got it -- you hire a private eye , fly him out there , he follows her around a couple days , she ' ll never know a thing . ted considers this .
but that ' s kind of cheating , isn ' t it ? not to say confusing .
not at all . it ' s a much more organic approach to gaming than classic , arbitrary , rule- dominated games . it ' s the future , <person> . you ' ll see how natural it feels .
let ' s ask her . <continued_utterance> cecilia , what should we do ?
birdie ?
in fact i have . i saw him and his lady leave .
when was this ?
<person> like you ' ve got a real fucked up idea of fun . now turn around . <continued_utterance> just for the future , when a woman ' s crying like that , she ' s not having any fun !
<person> . i should have gone ahead and fucked her .
<person> .
what ?
the quartet is part of the bit about <person> . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing i had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than i did . they knew all of us .
you ' re stalling , verbal .
that would make it about the time of her old man ' s suicide . you don ' t think that could explain some erratic behavior ?
all i ' m saying is , i think we should go slow here .
huh .
the most honest moment in a man ' s life is the five minutes after he ' s blown a load . that ' s a medical fact . and it ' s because you ' re no longer trying to get laid . you ' re actually thinking like a girl . they love that .
just the look on his face when you . . it ' s not funny .
now , thelma , that is not .
and the other girl , <person> . <person> ' s niece .
thank you for talking to me , <person> . i am sorry about <person> , she .
<person> is suspicious . we are moving sooner , tonight . we understand each other ?
yes . yes .
when she said it , there was something familiar . but no .
you dropped a glass .
but you never do .
if we were a team , we could do anything . i mean , anything .
my step-father ' s going to tear you apart .
i ' m torn apart already . i mean it ! under all that armor is a beautiful -- <continued_utterance> who is that girl , anyway ?
telling when people have done something wrong ?
yes .
<person> , owner-operator .
well , excuse me for askin ' , <person> , but isn ' t it kinda dead in here ?
no thanks .

if you want to keep all your fingers , stay the hell out of my galley unless you ' re invited .
some of you already know mr .
as long as you keep overpaying me , i ' ll be the first to go into production on three , and four , as well . <continued_utterance> mr . <person> , i could have <number> of them ready by tomorrow .

oh , <person> ! oh , ricky-y-y ! please let me come down and work at the club !

good good . how you doin ' ?

it ' s him .
they ' d never sail this close to the shore .
wait a minute - i ' ve got it . there ! off the port bow !
what do you want with him ? <person> smiles now , tapping his metal helmet .
canandiacute ; t read my mind ?
<person> .
<person> .

yeah , i seen it . that girl over there , she has it .
you know . i hate being called the brilliant one . the ruthless one . they guy who does the dirty work . the one everybody ' s afraid of . <continued_utterance> i hate it . i ' m not smart , you know . and i ' m not so ruthless .
you ' re right about the smart part , but ruthless , well .
that ' s why we ' re here , <person> .
out back in our morgue desmond starts to leave . cable it ' s <number> : <number> . we close at five .
so many secrets .
that ' s because i ' m really an arms dealer .

because i don ' t think you want to see <person> ' s entire career destroyed . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
what are you talking about ?
about <person> . i understand , and i don ' t blame you for shielding her . a beat . <continued_utterance> i spoke to her , and everything is all right .

<person> asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ?
it ' s your car . these are all your cars .
some of them have to be automatics .
<person> , tell me about the surprise .
oh , yeah . <person> yourself .

hello , <person> .
<person> ? ! ? what are you doing here ?
what ? why ?
breaking and entering .
yeah , i did , and i do , but .

someone with your accent should never be allowed to say `jew ' again .
that accent allowed me to execute many a nazi .
<person> ' t you ship the film to new york ?
i developed it in my room . <person> , <person> ? !
he had a heart attack , hon , but he ' s okay , he ' s at the hospital .

-we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal .
but you ' re not dismissing me .
then we go after him .

<person> looked real skeezed this morning . like he was on a dope jag .
<person> ?

well , what the hell took you so long ? what ' d you do , go out for breakfast or something ? i didn ' t even have time for a cup of coffee , for chrissakes .
she snuck away . and we haven ' t seen her . she hasn ' t come home .
oh , man --
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty .
unbearable , i ' d imagine .
i got into stereo equipment when i was a kid . some people don ' t notice the difference but it is very important to me .
of course it is . have some more wine . <continued_utterance> now , francisco , my friend . i must know where these men are who killed my captains . not where they were last week , but where they are today , and better still , tomorrow . you are clever . you can predict where they will be , can ' t you ? francisco begins to weep .
because he was worried about me .

get out , frances . you can say you were hijacked .
it ' ll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat . <continued_utterance> you have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse .
abuses in your case . you destroyed my hydro-boat in less than seven minutes , as no doubt will be the case with this . <continued_utterance> <number> , my deputy assistant . i ' m grooming him to follow me .

i didn ' t want to have to come here . i wish that i didn ' t have to ever see you again . i ' ve gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me . i was going through life , sailing along , pretty good . doing okay , and i tried to get even with some crazy guy . and i ' m here .
the wet becomes you . <person> rid of some of the slickness .
you put him down or don ' t bother coming back .
but .

i ' d like to ask you something . were you ever in an oxygen tent ?
oxygen tent ? oh no !
then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .

my employer wishes to remain anonymous .

hi . <person> said to introduce myself . i ' m <person> , <person> ' s neurotic sister .
a pleasure . i ' m neurotic too .
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world ' s most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on <person> .
my daddy aint never killed nobody , has he , mama ?

<person> been worse .
i played in the pro-am with some asshole movie star shot <number> here once . how did a great ball- striker like you , a `legend , ' manage to shoot an <number> ?

<person> your smart mouth . this means the end of child support .
the c . i . a .

oh , now ?
whenever you wish .
<person> . <continued_utterance> hey , my snakeskin jacket . thanks , baby . did i ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom ?
bout fifty thousand times . i got us a room at the cape fear , and guess what ? . i hear powermads at the hurricane .
it ' s not a bad thing , finding out that you don ' t have all the answers . that ' s when you start asking the right questions .
for the first time in my life , i have no idea what i ' m supposed to do .
i don ' t get it .
<person> ' t get what ?
what book is that ?
meth . methodology and <person> .

<person> .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
is that so bad ? it ' s not like i wouldn ' t try to make him happy . for awhile , anyway . i mean , i would . do things for him . i guess i ' m no good that way . i guess i tried to sucker you along like that . do you hate me for it ? i wouldn ' t blame you if you did . but maybe it ' s like you said : you just got to do whatever it takes to get out . bobby whatever it takes . <person> steps to the edge of the plateau . <continued_utterance> i wish i was a bird . i know it ' s stupid . every child says that . when i was growing up some of the old ones on the reservation believed people could actually change into animals . i wish i could . <continued_utterance> if i was a bird i would fly to florida ; to <person> . i always wanted to go there . i ' d fly to new york . maybe . i guess new york isn ' t the best place to be a bird . i ' d fly to st . <person> , then new orleans , all over texas . then i ' d fly to california . i guess by then i ' d have seen it all and i could die . <continued_utterance> they say you don ' t feel anything . the shock kills you before you hit the ground . i don ' t know how they would know that . but i heard it ' s just like flying ; straight down into the ground . i guess if it doesn ' t hurt it ' s a beautiful thing . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s a funny thing . <person> now i bet you don ' t know if you want to kill me , or fuck me .

i ' m fine . !
relax . they only come out at night .
this is not going well .
well , that thing in the ice sure weren ' t no dog .
of course not . but whatever it was revived , it . well , the thing was probably disoriented . and realized it couldn ' t survive for long in our atmosphere . but being the incredibly adaptable creature it was . it tried to become something that could . before the norwegians killed it . it somehow got to this dog .
<person> , i got lot ' s of friends .
i don ' t .

yeah aren ' t you forgetting something <person> : rule one , capital reserves . this company has $ <number> million cash in an overfunded pension . that buys us a lot of credibility . . and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker .

hey , what are you doing in here ?
the officers told me to wait here . i ' ve been sitting here for over two hours .

the most honest moment in a man ' s life is the five minutes after he ' s blown a load . that ' s a medical fact . and it ' s because you ' re no longer trying to get laid . you ' re actually thinking like a girl . they love that .
<person> you ' re right .
i really have to pee --
<person> , i know i ' m not perfect , and i may have made a few wrong turns , but you have to understand -- i ' m a chosen . that ' s a lot of responsibility -- you can ' t even imagine .

she wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father .
so how can i help ?
or when you ' re in bed .
yes ! my job is to find a story , then tell a story -- whatever it is -- because i believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow , through information alone , we all have a better chance to survive . i believe in information . that ' s a very romantic streak i have running through me -- maybe it ' s a weakness . information is good -- lack of information is bad . <person> , eh ?
from the sun . it ' s a reflection on the glass .
it ' s her ! i ' m telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she ' s trying to contact me !

<person> .
<person> , listen . you have to come with me .
why ? so you can get rid of me , too ?
but he ' s not here .
if he ' s not here , he has a reason , because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body . i can ' t expect you to know anything about a person like that . you ' ve nothing but a suit .
it ' s not that , frank , really it ' s not .
i know , that was terrible of me .
<person> then , mr . <person> ! prove it .

you can ' t just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that ' s going to solve our problems ? i ' m sorry , x . it was a kick for a while , but it ' s over . you ' re just not going anywhere .

they speak ?
yes .
really ? <continued_utterance> that ' s an interesting idea . actually , i just wanted to ask you .
at least that way things would have been clearer to begin with , y ' see . they wouldn ' t have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib , y ' know ? ' <person> nothing ever comes out of our rib , y ' know ? <person>r . only out of our prick , and even then . <person>rything still has to be done after that .
<person> , that just wouldn ' t work . i depend on that child support money to eat .
but shouldn ' t you depend on the child support money for , you know . child support ?
what the hell ?
i caught him ! i caught him trying to steal the gold .
i feel good .

they ruined me tonight .
as an example . i came home last night , i get undressed , and i realize you ' re sleeping on my side of the bed . i ' ve always slept on that side . it ' s something i ' ve always done .
then why didn ' t you just nudge me a bit and tell me to go and sleep on the other side ?
did you want me to clip <person> ?
not yet . by now , he ' s stashed <person> , so he ' s travelling solo .
<person> ' t you think you ' re overreacting ?
yes . the famous james <person> . i ' ve heard all about you , sir . you were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off , on your own , like some half-assed cia cowboy - endangering the gold , attracting that lunatic woman , and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide .
-no , no . it ' s nothing . i had a phone call , just before yours .
was it him ? the cop you were telling me about ?
thanks . <continued_utterance> quite a shopping spree . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean .
hey , i ' ve got it , i may as well spend it , right ? i ' ve always wanted to live where i could dive for my dinner .

it feels so . . real .
it ' s better than real . it ' s synthetic flesh . <person> blood . <person> organs . it ' s a physiological machine .
he ' ll be thrilled to knock me around . plus he ' s holding something of mine , so we can kill two birds . he ' ll grab us tuesday in front of the pacific dining car .

you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .
i ' m not your boy . i don ' t like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . <person> ' s just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
that i couldn ' t . say . let me ask you something : was she a little <continued_utterance> well she must ' ve packed on a few pounds over the years .
<person> ' s a little chubby , huh ?
<person> dunk .
beauty . beauty .

i ' ve got you so whipped .
i operated a gas station .
but you still operate a gas station , don ' t you ?
is this a bad time .
we , we . no . we just had a small reversal in the case . i have some , uh . i have some work to do .
. more of a half-wit . for a start a war could break out there any day .
that ' s just media talk . they ' re . . just a minority . they ' re powerless .
i guess not .
he ' s trying to put it behind him , <person> . you should too . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got a beautiful life . and even with this , it ' s always been clear that he loves you . i ' ve come to think that ' s all that really matters .
i ' m just trying to help .
i don ' t want your help !
what ' s <person> , speak <person> , speak <person> !
<person> ! what ' s with you , man ? <continued_utterance> <person> a minute . <person> -- what are you doin ' ? you ain ' t a fbi . you ain ' t the law . let me see your -- ray snaps out his gun , straight-armed .
of course .
i didn ' t quit my old team . i got thrown off .
<person> , your fishy ' s losing air .
<person> ?
really ?
really .
<person> , coulda , woulda . get him in the water .
<person> , for <person> ' s sake .
like this .
show me .
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn ' t breathe ? that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?
um . sure .
we got through two states already .
that dont smell like a more .
<person> , boss , you got the ' s ' word .
what am i doing wrong ?
sure . it ' s to break up winds , so we don ' t have no more dust storms . can you imagine what it ' ll mean to this section of the country ? i ' ll show you . it works perfectly now . here ' s the principle . you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky . these air currents -- oh , stop it !
oh !
i know i don ' t have to be .
i haven ' t even heard of half these bands .
then why son , why didn ' t you follow his order ?
because -- i panicked .
when you do , how do you ?
like in a church painting . i see this giant hovering over the ground . he ' s wearing a robe , and has long flowing hair , and he ' s pointing his finger at something .
i . i don ' t know what ' s real .
what happened that night , <person> ?
hey , the terminator ! <person> ' em away <person> .
and , i ' m pretty sure we got the beezer brothers out of tulsa coming in with us and i ' m working on the silverberg boys in canada .
he ' s dead .
two hours . just until he makes bail .
it ' s the only way to ensure the safety of our borders .
it ' s madness !
<person> , i ' m calling you out .
what ? you want to fight ? over her ?
yeah .
you sure ?
i don ' t know .
are we being watched ?
what if theyandiacute ; re naughty ?
get some shut-eye , slick .
he ' s dead . i know it .
then why did they bring us all the way here to see him ? he doesn ' t know .
<person> think about it too long . you had enough ?
have now .
i ' m not going to stay long anyway . i already said that , didn ' t i . <person> . i ' m a total wreck . <continued_utterance> <person> , this woman is the most adorable creature i have ever come in contact with . if she turns out to be even as good-looking as a mailbox , i will be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her .
she could be a real dog .
what happens it i come out ?
we ' ll put in a word with the big boys . maybe you ' ll just get exile to venus .
have you been a patient of dr . <person> ' s for a long time ?
long time ? i wouldn ' t call it a long time . what ? three or four days ?
do you suspect either of the women ?
according to wilhite , they were in santa barbara at the time .
' <person> , ' what does that mean . ?
it ' s a common medical expression , it ' s a crash program to restore the heartbeat . dr . <person> cut an airway in her trachea , to get her oxygen , her and the baby . ms . <person> .
do not make light of it , <person> . they can do it . quick ! like that ! and then . then i can not sit at table with you . i can not take a thing from your hand . i . i can not go with you to meeting ! <person> , good <person> , you must not go too far ! dear child !
i am not a child .
i ' m not tired .
i need to be with her .
oh . hey , <person> . what ' s up ?
<person>ie , i have some bad news !
before it was changed by <person> .
i operated a gas station .
oh yeah . accidentally . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry . my foot accidentally jumped up in the air where you could see the bottom of it . i hate it when that happens .
come on . you ' re going to get us in trouble .
no , i hate loving her . i hate the kind of person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little `` games '' she plays . like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me . the bitch . she loved to play . she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it . she tortures me . but she ' s family . she ' s my little girl . my baby . i couldn ' t stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . no . not me . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy . how much you want ? a pause .
make it twenty . jake twenty-thousand ? i don ' t have that kind of money . i won ' t get the insurance until months after she ' s dead . i don ' t imagine you ' ll want to be stickin ' around after poor <person> ' s demise . twenty-thousand ; that ' s more money than i could ever get my hands on . <continued_utterance> how much could you get ?
exactly , and this is how i know i ' m not getting into business with the u . s . government .
you will help me with my other problem .
well , i like the countryside .
that ' s good , `cause you might end up spending a lot of time here .
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he ' d get his name cleared , but it didn ' t happen .
connections and politics , it ' s the same everywhere .
now who are we talking about ?
<person> ' s boy , <person> , to start with . the <person> ' s <person> was another one .
call him ?
call him . <person> ' t tell him anything . tell him you ' re having a wonderful time and you ' ll be home tomorrow night .
no , no , i ' m fine .
you ' re gon na need to muscle up , big guy -- give it the old steroid jerk . <person> is cool as ice . he smiles , then moves around to the other side of the ball , suddenly facing away from the course . this baffles everyone .
who ? what are you talking about ?
they ' re on me . they ' re smoking me out !
<person> , i thought he was -- <person> slaps her .
do you think i didn ' t know about you all along ? my contacts in the kgb told me you were coming . you show up undercover and , i must admit , you play your part to the hilt . when it ' s time to be cruel , you are cruel . when it ' s time to be passionate , you are very very passionate indeed . <continued_utterance> i could have killed you , but i thought this would be so much more fun . to twist you and use you how i see fit . and to be honest , you went much farther than i ever expected you would for your country . <continued_utterance> and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?
where are you ? are you watching <person> ' s house again ?
it ' s my fucking house and no . i ' m just driving . where ' s the kid now ?
oh , a couple of weeks ago .
everyone is breaking up . you . me . this other person i know broke up with someone in an elevator . i think it was in an elevator . or just outside it . or after it . it got stuck . i think . and suddenly everything became clear . when i saw you , at the coffee place , i was waiting for him and i was --
stop ! stop it ! sheriff were you going to help her fly away , asshole ? what ' d you think , you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to ? she tell you the story about old jake forcing her to marry him ? that ' s a good story . how he killed her crazy <person> ? <person> in bloody agony . <person> stunned that <person> would reveal this now publicly . <continued_utterance> <person>damnit <person> , stop ! <person> ' t !
. but i bet the story she
will you just open the door !
or drugs .
<person> , that ' s insane .
so my wife is lying ?
<person> .
dr . griswold . a moment of pathetic silence , then : molly starts laughing -- he is destroyed . <continued_utterance> the therapist laughs at her patient ? is that how it works ? a man is laid bare before god and he ' s the butt of the cosmic joke ?
this is a light beer . you can ' t have a light beer ?
no i can ' t .
yes yes , i did get my degree up there .
<person> ?
um-hmm .
where ' s <person> ?
no !
thank you , <person> .
i came to join the king ' s musketeers .
bad timing .
yeah . maybe . i dunno .
do you think i ' m strange ?
tell him .
that who i think it is ? <person> turns to her , then picks up the radio .
oh , praise the lord .
nobody calls me an idiot .
it didn ' t come up .
well i do . i ' ve always loved you , <person> . i
that ' s too bad .
no -- i don ' t mean -- she ' s not ill . she ' s just . i don ' t know .
i think he could do it .
he says older men have been called , and besides , he misses the food . i tell you , susan , he tried to make it a casual letter , with little jokes , but it came out just begging .
to get what belongs to me .
so now you own a satellite ?
all right -- but just -- we have to be out of the house by eight , so -- i don ' t want to tell <person> you ' re coming unless you really think you can make it --
yeah -- no -- i ' ll be there .
how about <person> , she knows all the routines , she could pick it up in no time .
on the other hand , it ' s all right if we lose a number , we ' re running too long now . we have to cut somewhere .
oh my god . this man ' s tissue .
it ' s like jelly .
you know by rights i could take this farm back today , don ' t you ? and i ' m a great believer in my rights .
it will come .
and why have you come here ? to make peace ? you long for battle . you crave it . i see you for what you are , <person> <person> . nothing but a boy , trying to prove himself a man .
this boy has grown tired of your mockery .
why is he worried ?
because , i don ' t know , because sometimes . sometimes i forget things . and ever since <person> left , ever since my daughter left for school , there ' ve been . i fainted and . why is this so hard ?
everything ?
all the answers you seek will be yours , once i reclaim <person> .
you can ' t expect me to pay you for your -- attachment to that car .
i don ' t . i expect you to pay me for yours .
but can you kill a person ? can you do that , <person> ? can you kill me ? hide my body . contact the crazies . trust them to pay up . <person> over my now-decaying , fucking grotesque corpse . really expect them to hand over <number> mil cash ? <person> ' t you ever go to the fuckin ' movies ?
i like your script . i want to be in it .
where are we ?
you got me . but i think i know what they did with <person> .
<person> ' t cross <person> . he ' ll crush you . you ' ve worked hard to get where you are . if <person> doesn ' t buy <person> someone else will ; and who ' s to say they won ' t do the same thing .
at least i wouldn ' t be pulling the trigger .
for what ? because i ' m a dangerous man . because i know too much about the truth .
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar .
<person> .
they call me old man <person> . i ' m what you might call the founder of the feast . now maybe you ain ' t <person> , but we skylark through your dingy little country just about any time we damn well <person> and big-hat , crummy- lookin ' free-holes stumblin ' around in the dark ain ' t allowed . <person> po-lice , huh ? think you ' re bad medicine , don ' t you ? hell , i ' ve let stronger stuff run down my leg . so next time we come <person> step aside . get in our hair again , we ' ll saw your prods off with butter knives and stuff ' em in your gobs . <person> ' t kiddin ' neither . you been told . now git .
me and wes are just going to talk .
why you got to move away to talk ! ?
just go . it ' s all right . <person> , really . <person> well .
all right , well , good night .
you remind me of my daddy , you know ? <person> told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies . he had a long nose , too , like theirs . did i ever tell you how he died ?
in a fire , as i recall .
but . but where did i go wrong ?
<person> , boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man . a boy ' s whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed .
we ' ll see about that . harmsway glances at his watch . <person> coldly .
<person> ' t you late for a meeting ?
you don ' t show for chicago , everyone ' ll know there ' s something going on .
i don ' t care . cancel it .
well , i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with <person> .
you love her , but you hate her ?
<person> , sometimes . lots of the kids hang out here . you really think something bad happened to <person> ?
<person> ever come out here ? <continued_utterance> i say something funny ?
i have no idea .
the course of love is full of frightful turns . but , no matter how you feel , no matter how hopelessly afraid . never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in france . <person> that your starting point , and everything else will fall . into place .
<person> , manslaughterer whos broke his parole and got in mind nothin but immoral purposes fars youre concerned .
thank the lord . well , you aint let me down yet , sailor . thats moren i can say for the rest of the world ?
what ?
that crazy guy that banged into my car and smashed my windows in . i don ' t fucking believe it ! i ' m gon na get him .
i can ' t . but i did enjoy the dress rehearsal .
<person> tien , mr . <person> .
ah , <person>dan . i was a drunk . i mean , you know . i ' m sorry .
forget it . you were always a front runner . you never had any interest in underdogs . but i was your son .
no ! for god sake you ' ve got it all backwards . <continued_utterance> aids , the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns . this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs .
what do you mean , walked ?
that ' s four . let us know if it starts moving , burt .
<person> that .
<person> . <person> . what a coincidence . mind if i sit down ?
yes i do . i ' m expecting someone .
i take it back you don ' t act like <person> , you act like <person> .
i know it . he ' s winning . i do act like him . i feel like him sometimes . i ' ve got ta get out of this place or i ' m a dead one .
but . . why didn ' t you say something , <person>p ? i mean , what are we doing here ? grady gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield , turns on the ignition .
i thought maybe i made it all up .
- instant melt-down .
<person> will look like a campfire .
-no more information over an open line . i ' ll be at the bethune event later on today . find me there .
i ' m giving you on-scene command . <person> wants everyone removed from the premises and the entire house bagged for evidence and brought to <person> . can you handle this ?
where is he ?
dr . <person> is in the trunk .
well --
-- i thought -- maybe you could sell your half of the house to me , and i could pay you whatever it is over a certain amount of time , and that way --
i ' ve been doing this a long time , <person>p . i feel this kid in my bones .
only in your bones ?
i know where i ' ve heard it before . i know .
i needed a backup .
you know , considering you ' ve only been out of prison for seven hours , you ' re readapting quite well . <person> , i didn ' t mean that the way it sounded . i meant .
<person> ' t worry about it , all right ?
what ?
if it stops them from hurting you and me . maybe we should .
watch the tone fella .
fuck you boyd !
i thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why didn ' t you buy a nice big power boat ?
come on , man . i ' ll make a sailor out of you yet .
why don ' t i get a recording ?
i don ' t know , sir . maybe the number was just recently disconnected . maybe there ' s a temporary malfunction in the wiring . why don ' t you try it again in the morning ?
i wanted to . i thought we could make it .
why didn ' t you say anything ?
<person> ' t move a muscle .
<person> that work ?
excuse me , i think the word you ' re searching for is <person> .
the word i ' m searching for i can ' t say because there ' s pre-school toys present .
well in the city of philadelphia , <person> needs a little help !
i could never love a man who was so . little . <continued_utterance> the other night . when you saw me after my bath . i . i tried to look as i thought you would want a woman to look . i am sorry . that i did not .
<person> ! make a space ! this is where the spaceship lands .
-- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action !
well , let ' s see , we ' ve got double a ' s --
watch yourself ! ! <continued_utterance> halt ! who goes there ? !
in the window . <person> ' s at work .
i don ' t .
no first of all . i ' m not in a game mood .
you ' re interrupting a personal conversation .
one of these days you ' re going to meet somebody extra cute and the next performance i ' ll be doing a single .
<person> ' ll ever be cute enough to break up this sister act .
what is it ?
rogueandiacute ; s missing .
hi , babe -- whaddya say you put on a sexy dress , and i take you out to dinner tonight ?
great . what ' s the occasion ?
in my case , they don ' t come along at all .
she ' s the worst combination : stunning looks and a brilliant mind .
it ' ll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat . <continued_utterance> you have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse .
thanks , frances .
what are you doing here , <person> ? i expressly asked you not to come .
to hell with that . what do i have to do to prove my love to you ? my friends have gotten laid and i ' m pretty sure neither one of them was beaten with a tree trunk , raped by a walrus , or had to contend with the likes of trent preston !
not now , <person> . i ' ve got some bad news .
<person> news ? !
er . i don ' t know . it ' s all owned by you , that ' s obvious . humm . everything ' s from a garage sale !
vacation , <person> . everything you see is part of a vacation . every year , for one month , i bring my family to this house on vacation . nice , isn ' t it ?
our home city , of course . but i should start with you . would you like some moonshine ? <continued_utterance> then what would you like ?
i ' d like to fuck you .
<person> ?
how you choose to live your own life is your business . but you be careful with that boy , <person> . with <person> . he belongs to somebody else .
you know . . the guys who ride the short bus .
<person> ' t that a little politically incorrect ?
the bible . why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles .
interpreted by another guy like my father .
it .
it ? oh
are you with me <person>dy ? <continued_utterance> i want you with me .
i ' m with you <person> .
. you helped save the airline and the people at the airline are gon na remember you for it .
. if i was you , i ' d think about that bluestar job <person> ' s offered you .
because you have hope that you ' ll get better ?
no . maybe i believe <person> has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself . maybe i believe the journey , the big adventure , never ends . he kneels on the floor . puts his head on her pillow next to hers . <continued_utterance> maybe i believe <person> sent you to me because i am ill . to help me through . <continued_utterance> i want to go home .
no .
i thought you might see it my way . <continued_utterance> where you going , x ? i said where you going ?
i ' m looking . and i sure don ' t like what i see .
<person> enough . but it ' s not that simple , <person> . when i was down and had nothing , it was <person> who helped me . he got me all my clients -- you among them . and he can take it away like that . you may find out one day -- that when you ' ve had money and lost it , it ' s worse than never having had it at all .
what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .
thats disgustin . those kinda sentiments should not be allowed out in public . is this <person> yet ?
who ' s that ?
the wives .
but recent events have been
we ' ve become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . while the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there ' s nothing fake about <person> himself . no scripts . no cue cards . it ' s not always shakespeare but it ' s genuine . that ' s how he can support an entire channel .
there ' s one guy for sure ! a redhead , kind of young , disguised sort of like a college student .
i knew it . they ' re going to be watching us around the clock .
the ozone must be fully depleted on <person> .
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?
i can fight it a little longer .
no . you ' ve put it off too long ! i worry for you .
really .
they ' re glass . the buttons .
my <person> ?
we ' re sorry .
it ' s not like he ' s a young man , <person> . he ' s had time to live . it ' d be quick . i mean , he wouldn ' t even have to
<person> ! i think this place is making me crazy . i was crazy to come back here and see you . i ' m crazy for listening to anyone in this town , and i ' d sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute with you .
thelma , that is not an option .
but i don ' t know . something ' s crossed over in me and i can ' t go back . i mean , i just couldn ' t live .
the window .
are you hungry ? i was gon na make some pancakes .
<person> , then we don ' t have a deal .
<person> , okay . <continued_utterance> that ' s good coke .
. was the man at the restaurant ? <continued_utterance> sometimes the mind behaves as if it were in a dream . faces change , people become other people . the subconscious is a powerful thing . you treated <person> carelessly , didn ' t you , <person> ? your feeling of responsibility or guilt over <person> might have easily turned <person> into <person> . do you know what derangement is ?
i need your help .
sshh . <person> back .
where is she ? did he hurt her ?
yeah . just a little .
<person> strange or bad strange ?
photographer ?

<person> .
it ' s over .
who , mr . <person> ? the kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists ? the oliver stones of the world ? i ' ll publish their books , i ' ll make their movies , i ' ll put them on my tv shows ! they ' re my bellboys . they carry my luggage . <continued_utterance> now . get them in the airlock .
one problem , <person> : the girl . and the handcuffs . they ' ll give it away .
no ! <continued_utterance> no , i ' ve got it .
what happened to your hand ?
it is a girl .
show me its arm . <continued_utterance> it ' s true then . i must tell <person> .
-- were with . `` i didn ' t know who you were with . ``
excuse me ?
you wanted to play my game , didn ' t you ?
yeah , i did , and i do , but .
i am , really .
it ' s just she ' s been the focus for a while .
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her . in my house .
oh god .
everybody knows why she went over <person> . you jibed the boat .
i was trying to get her up wind ! that ' s what you do when you ' re hit a-beam . or maybe you ' re too stupid to know that !
they don ' t know that ! it was just you and me there . i ' ll say he raped me and you had to shoot him ! i mean , it ' s almost the truth !
it won ' t work .
aw , shit , thelma , he ' s gon na kill you .
well , he has never let me go . he never lets me do one goddamn thing that ' s any fun . all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he ' s out doing god only knows what . <continued_utterance> i left him a note . i left him stuff to microwave . <continued_utterance> i guess you haven ' t heard anything from jimmy . yet ? <continued_utterance> . never mind .
you ' re still an idealist .
oh hell .
how ' s it coming back there , <person> ?
who ' s that ?
<person> believes it can happen to them .
it can ' t be .
go ahead , <person> .
i have a pick-up truck . no plates . subject -- indian -- entering suspect ' s house . over .
-- that you ' ve lost hold of -- well , not just your religious feeling , but lost hold of any kind of anchor , any kind of trust in anything . i mean no wonder you drift around so much . what could ever stop you ? how would you ever know if you had found the right thing ?
well , uh , i ' m not really looking for anything , man . i ' m just , like , trying to get on with it .
there ' s no rest for them . move them along . move them along !
please , please , please . <person> on your feet . no , please . no no no . <continued_utterance> please please . <person> on your feet .
you are acting like one !
i will be the judge of that .
you got it .
i haven ' t got it yet .
<person> .
and for dessert , anisette biscotti and a thermos of espresso .
fast . <continued_utterance> i ' m basically a coward , russell , i hope you understand that . i hope we don ' t get shot .
me too .
you didn ' t see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , didn ' t you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target .
go to hell .
where is <person> ?
he is in his pigeon cage .
th . d . ?
yeah -- that . that ' s dr . of thinkology !
i won ' t let you kill her !
you are a weakling . like you fa- ther ! can you not see that i am about to become all-powerful !
but then it is better this way , don ' t you think ? no loose ends . <continued_utterance> what ?
that was the same thing <person> said .
no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it ' s been a pointless journey .
why do you say that , mr . <person> ?
<person> , meet <person> .
i ' ll just be in the kitchen .
three . you ? <person> ?
no .
what ?
that ' s the sky that ' s going to be over our roof every night , when we ' re done . <continued_utterance> we could always buy a new generator . <continued_utterance> well , what ' s wrong with it ?
gentlemen , you ready ? you ready ? let ' s go to war !
now the question is , how long can <person> conlon stay alive ? <continued_utterance> <person> just pounding on <person> conlon ! he ' s pounding on him like a side of beef !
what else have you forgot ?
how could i know what else i forgot ?
who ?
i need to kill our waiter .
that ' s right . and guess who ' s the new king of the unemployment line .
aw , come on , kid . throw me a bone .
why not ? you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary ? is jean-claude done yet ?
not quite .
<person> , please don ' t .
what did you think i would do ? <person> ! i gave up my life and my music .
no , i . . i got an appointment uptown .
this is a sure thing .
give me the keys .
you ' re not touchin ' that car .
you look good . how are you ?
i ' m okay . i ' m fine .
quit fooling around , <person> . this is your dad . is everything okay there ?
<person> ' t be afraid , dad . everything will be okay . you deserve to be loved .
i ' m okay . i ' m fine .
i said to hell with the budget and bought a roast . i made dumplings -- god , what ' s wrong with your hands ?
<person> . you ' ll hear from my lawyers . <number> a . m . <person> night .
he ' s right . i had to sell . the key to the game is your capital reserves . you don ' t have enough , you can ' t pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs .
i don ' t know . probably ignore her .
ignore her ?
she ' s been sayin ' she was going to go to l . a . but i don ' t know . i mean all her clothes are still here . an ' she ' s missin ' her graduation . she should graduate . she ' s a smart girl . <person> nods . he makes a note in his pad .
may have been she just partied too much . but we ' ll look into it . we find something , you ' ll be the first to know . <continued_utterance> it ' s starting , gloria . this is how it begins .
<person> . everything just got messed up after that .
<person> , well we all do stupid things . but the best part is that you got a another chance and now you ' re kicking butt .
no . no . we need to try our vaccine on it .
and if it ' s unsuccessful ?
you could give me my gun back .
why don ' t we just finish what we started .
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas .
they organized this , not me . i have nothing to do with it .
it ' s not about being fun . it ' s about being smart . you take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you don ' t ever have to do anything again . ever . that ' s freedom . that ' s what i ' m talking about .
and i ' m talking about enjoying myself .
why ? you ask me , <person> had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he ' s gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you ' re describing .
the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man ' s surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him . it ' s just a reminder of what should have been his . <continued_utterance> your old man graduates from <person> , you ' re not supposed to wind up there . <person> of <person> maybe , but not in the lousy guidance office . now . <person> number two . i ' ve run a financial on <person> . <person> was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like <person> .
what ?
let ' s go out and do something .
you are .
are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp .
<person> ? what are you , a faggot ? in my country a man don ' t pay we cut off his head .
get your ass down to this superior , arizona . bring me this <person> cooper . i don ' t think he got the lesson . this is your last chance , <person> .
oh he can hold you . he weighs two-hundred-and-thirty pounds .
a real clydesdale , huh <person> ? <person> hops onto <person> ' s back . ted giddy-up .
new york . ever been there ?
sure . sure i ' ve been there . they look at each other . <person> coughs again .
<person> of a bitch !
<person> ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?
you didn ' t transform them , <person> , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .
i feel like i could do anything !
after you ? i hired sylvia ! the baby ' ll be named after me !
i ' ve been dancing with her ! that ' s more important ! the baby ' ll be named after me !
he ' s right . and things are happening too fast . it smells like the bay of pigs all over again .
as if dealing with the russians wasn ' t hard enough , we got ta worry about our own house .
<person> . yes . how are you today ?
i ' m fine .
the queen ?
if i were you , i ' d make myself scarce . these men are going to be very angry when they wake up .
where are <person> and <person> ?
probably in their rooms , crying .
well , i -- i ' m just trying to do my best here -- and i ' m gettin ' it from all sides .
i know you are .
my friends are dead .
well . if it ' s any consolation , you ' ll soon be joining them .
i guess . <person> never tells <person> the truth about how much he pays for these things .
you ' re really good friends with the chancellor , aren ' t you ?
but what can we do ? she don ' t know who ' s visiting her .
. i know . i went .
no . i haven ' t .
what ' s wrong , <person> ?
no , it is . <person> , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it ' s not because you ' re a space ranger , pal , it ' s because you ' re a toy ! you are his toy .
but why would <person> want me ?
so there ' s no border , no customs . they can just drive anywhere they want . . . there ' s nothing to stop them . . .
just us .
<person> ' s got your wife and valiant . he took them to the acme factory,
<person> ' s go !
<person> , okay .
<person> . now hit a seven iron into that tree over there . you ' re ready .
what ?
your real life . the one you came back for .
and you still might . this report legitimizes we ' ve worked so hard for . we can raise funs now . it could change everything !
it won ' t change anything for me .
sure .
he didn ' t give his name .
you ' re an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you ' re not getting any younger .
i plan on getting a lot older . and playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead .
<person> .
it was luck .
why are you such a penis <person> . do you do it on purpose or can ' t you help it .
tug my chain <person> .
<person> ? isn ' t he too young ?
i don ' t really care at this point . if it makes him happy , he can have it . i get nothing from that kid .
and if you did ?
i wouldn ' t tell you .
six rounds . <number> .
that ' s what it looks like , doesn ' t it ? but that ' s what a ten gauge , choke-bored , shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away .
you didn ' t see his face
you see my face , don ' t you ? <continued_utterance> everybody get this through their heads . <person> dies . i ' m running the show now and i ' m telling you , earp dies . his men too . they all die . <person> ? we ' re gon na kill ' em . for what they did to <person> we ' re gon na ride ' em into the ground and slaughter ' em like rabbits . ' cause this is my time , children .
no .
that ' s , like , in the complete opposite direction !
consider him slimed , sir .
<person> . next . <person> . your report ?
you ' re a genuine curiosity <person> jankowski . what am i to do with you ? . i threaten to throw you off a moving train , feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway . so i think - <person> ' s an educated man . for <person> to disobey me and shoot that horse , that horse must have been in pretty bad shape . perhaps bad enough to injure my <person> during the show . and so i think <person> jankowski might be a valuable person to have around .
tell diamond joe the animals need more water when the humidity ' s this bad if i don ' t see him before i go .
sure honey , what ' s the hurry ?
i forgot my books at school .
<person> ?
i good you bid evening .
well , whatever you said to <person> , it was enough to get him to give <person> a black eye .
<person> , i just don ' t get it . this guy has cock-blocked at every turn and you ' re taking his side ? ! ?
for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you . it doesn ' t add up . <person> ' s got ' em running scared . and i ' ll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .
<person> .
what ' s wrong mr . <person> .
it seems we ' re short on singers .
tell ' em your father gave it to you .
what if they call him ?
the hell you say .
i ' m not . <person> down <person> ' s old stuff , and he ' s twice as big as me -- i ' m gon na stay home .
<person> .
<person> , this is an elementary school .
exposing the corrupt parts of the lapd will redeem the whole . i ' ll prove that police can police themselves-
-so you show-up <person> . co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can . <person> can you turn lemons to lemonade .
you smell like bourbon wilhite-
-fuck off . this is handled . and pull your idiot partner out of there-
the faa announcement .
sure i ' m sure . <person> , you got that mischievous look in your eyes . you used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping , just like that .
he stood you up .
what could have happened ? <person> looks suddenly stricken . kathleen why didn ' t he come ? maybe he showed up , took one look at me and left .
oh cripes . do you have change for a dollar ? all i have is these stupid <person>ese coins .
<person> ? have you been ?
. you should rest .
<person> .
i ' m having a hard time . i ' m working on two at once .
oh yeah , who ?
<person> !
a little for <person> . i ' m about fifty percent indian , you know . to all our relations . he takes a hearty swig of the soda . <continued_utterance> ah ! just what i needed ! want some ?
no , i ' m up to here with the coffee .
they got any good pool halls around here ?
nothing else matters .
we ' re not going to break up our act .
thank you . so were you . <person> . he tries to touch her hair . she ducks .
i haven ' t been nice to you .
i donandiacute ; t remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
i just wanted to make you clear on something . personally , i donandiacute ; t care what <person> wants with you . he can take those claws of yours and use them for barbecue skewers . what i do care about is the safety of this group . the professor is in charge , and after the professor , thereandiacute ; s me . so , for the remainder of your time here , youandiacute ; re going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt .
i don ' t think your dad would like you picking me up .
he wouldn ' t like a lot of things . hop in .
and when he ' s around , do your knees feel as weak as water ?
yes .
<person> , here , i just put it away .
<person> i can ' t give you guys a hand , but i ' ve got something cooking .
<person> asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ?
maybe i can get down there next week .
oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ?
<person> ' t even think about it , cowboy !
he went with you , didn ' t he ?
i thought you guys hooked up .
-- we need this one , dean . the quarantine ' s legal if we get a mandate , otherwise it ' s an act of war in the eyes of the world . get me that vote . make it unanimous .
mr . president , the organization of american states hasn ' t had a unanimous vote since -- the president moves for the cabinet room .
you ' ll never believe it .
of course i will .
you think you ' re so much smarter than me , don ' t you ?
no .
thank you sir ! thank you !
good-bye , mr . <person> . <continued_utterance> let ' s proceed with new business . <continued_utterance> gentlemen : in exactly <number> hours , we are going to initiate phase one of the word ' s most perfect crime : the biggest theft in the history of mankind . <person> here . in the strait of malacca .
<person> !
we ' ve got a lot of work to do , wil- low . bring in our brave men .
i ' d rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble . ' course these days i don ' t have to worry about that . my husband got laid off at the mill , and they repossessed the car , so wherever i wan na go , i just have to hoof it , you know ?
you don ' t have a car ? you want this one ?
is it a little late to call the chancellor ?
maybe . i don ' t know .
says what , <person> ?
something . amazing .
i ' ll take mine .
why ?
no happy snaps .
<person> , okay . i ' ll just . be over here .
i could subpoena him if i had a week .
i don ' t have a week . this case never should have come to trial . you know better . you ' re mr . independent . you want to be independent ? be independent now . i ' ve got no sympathy for you .
<person> . if a person can ' t get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins , at least he ought to be able to choose his own name . . and i wan na be called <person> !
fine . and you can call me . . <person> . <person> marie .
as if .
all right , then , let ' s see what you two jokers are made of , shall we ?
then you can ' t have that commission .
we ' ll see about that .
who ?
the guy on the phone .
he left ? what do you mean ?
he left out the window .
well . the store at saltzburg . but you won ' t be going to saltzburg for a while .
i ' m going this morning .
you mean they knew who i was ?
they kept this scrapbook of your life . it meant the world to them .
me-ow .
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .
you ' re always taking his side .
<person> .
. i don ' t want anyone to have a crack at you .
i ' m just kidding . i just thought . just thought i ' d check up on her . <person> , after that , i don ' t really know . i ' ve been thinking about <person> a lot . i still got some friends out there . i don ' t really know . <person> , i ' ll write you .
what ' s seems to be the problem ?
you ' ve got to stop the concert ! a bomb is going to go off !
<person> agents wear like suits and goofy ties . and dresses like my mom wears to church . <person> on that one show .
maybe you ' ve been watching too much
i get dizzy spells . <person> . cold sweats . hot sweats . fever blisters . difficulty swallowing . difficulty breathing . <person> vision . involuntary trembling . dead hands . weak ankles . twitching . fainting spells . numb lips . do you think that ' s normal ?
that depends . <continued_utterance> you do go out , you know .
this is all bullshit .
he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you didn ' t see him die .
i know youre thinkin that i got moren some of my mama in me ? well , i couldnt help it . <person> , i really couldnt . im sorry for that guy , but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies !
just part of life on the road , peanut .
um , yeah , but that would involve speaking to him .
well , i ' m definitely gon na be gone for a couple of days at least , sheila .
i ' m not so sure of anything as you are , <person> . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as i could live yours !
oh , come on , rachel . no way .
if you ' re selling something , i ' m late for work .
i ' m calling from professional nurse quarterly .
<person> . ? no , it ' s not <person> . you must let me back in . i won ' t harm anyone . i promise .
we ' ll see .
and what lesson have we learned from all of this , <person> . <person> .
i guess it proves you really care about me . you hung in there .
and these roses . they ' re much prettier up close .
i . there ' s something i have to ask you . <continued_utterance> that day . at the fence . you seemed terrified . i don ' t think i was imagining that .
i ' m a little short pops . i ' ll catch you next time .
your lies are old , but you tell ' em well .
nothing . but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her .
why ?
but i really don ' t think that i want action . me , i mean . the bearer of the excited bioport . what i want is . not now . not here . i feel too . too exposed .
my baby here has now taken three major hits , one in the church , one in the gas station , and one on the operating table . the only way i can tell if everything ' s ok - the game ' s not been contaminated , the pod ' s not fucked - is to play existenz with somebody friendly . are you friendly , or are you not ?
<person> --
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i don ' t even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you ' re coming back . or if you ' re coming back .
you look surprised .
what ' s wrong with you ? are you crazy ?
i know how they feel , man .
<person> ? can i ask you something ?
second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
why can ' t you be nice to me ?
what ' s the question nobody ' s asking ? why that building ? why not the federal building ?
the federal building was too well guarded .
<person> ? god what time is it ?
seven o ' clock . how about breakfast ?
soon . how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about ?
i can arrange that . i like that . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
what about her ?
nothing . tell me , what do you want out of life ?
ceiling , shapes .
i figure you saw her that day in the house and just gradually intuited the whole damn thing . that would be pretty astonishing . a passive-aggressive masterpiece . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t until the shower that i realized you actually believed it . nearly froze to death waiting for you . thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and i ' d be toast . <continued_utterance> the crazy thing is . i have never for one moment stopped loving you . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry about <person> . i ' m sure in some tragic way this ' ll bring us closer together . <continued_utterance> hey , it ' s norman . <person> , we had a huge blowout , so i ' m going down to sleep at the lab . i guess you ' re out , but . maybe . if you wouldn ' t mind stopping by to check on her in the morning ? <continued_utterance> it ' s just . jody , it ' s bad . i ' ve never seen her like this . i don ' t really know what to do anymore . <continued_utterance> if anything ever happened to her , i ' d . <person> , thanks . <continued_utterance> i ' m so sorry .
<person> ! you saved her life !
i did ? <continued_utterance> i mean , of course i saved her life . she ' s almost my daughter , isn ' t she ?
excuse me . did you , or did you not , have a gun to his head ?
he was trying to steal my car !
leland .
<person> didn ' t wash her hands before dinner . and look at this . <continued_utterance> oh , is this from a lover ? <person> has no response . leland did you get this from your lover ?
i don ' t know , <person> .
and where are they going with it ?
nothing again . came up short . let me get a little advance . three hundred , just to carry me for a bit .
<person> , i ' m already carrying you for , what is it -- twenty-three hundred ? something like that ?
i ' m sure they ' re just on rounds and will be back any minute . we ' ll try them again and we ' ll find <person> . you ' ll see . she probably just took a wrong turn up here , ended up in the middle of `` don ' t know where . `` happens lots of times . please drink up , <person> , it will make you feel better . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ?
how did you know my name ?
shut up , you ' re drunk .
i may be an idiot , but i ' m not drunk .
<person> ' t feel like nothing .

huh uh . a jockey . his name ' s , um , <person> . . <person> hardapple .

<person> ' t you afraid ?
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that ' s my problem . if you don ' t feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you can ' t imagine .
forget it .
<person> has some deep pockets . that ' s all i ' m saying .
hi .

hi , mr . pig . if i hit you on the head , will you make me a cuckoo bird ?
ok -- can you please stop cursing at me ?
i mean , i realize i ' m in no position to , uh , basically say anything , ever -- but it ' s not like i ' m down there in some redneck bar in florida having an argument with some stripper ' s boyfriend and i suddenly think , `` hey ! maybe this ' d be a good time to really stick it to <person> and get myself locked up for a few months . ``
uh - now , please don ' t be angry with me . i ' ll - i ' ll do anything you say , only . only if you don ' t shout at me . it makes me nervous !

because you act like a goddamn spook all the time . not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you .
<person> ? of me ?
how bad is it for you ?
bad enough . and god knows i don ' t exactly fit the new corporate profile .
well .
it doesn ' t matter . it only took me an hour to write .

' ooh , my , yes -- <person> , <person> . <continued_utterance> aw , <person> , if you ' re gon na --
you just about got dry-gulched , my man .
a former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of pisces -- something about floating through the universe --
you amuse me , <person> . but i ' m the only woman in america born after world war ii who thinks astrology is a crock of shit . now let ' s see if the big dog ' ll eat .
are you scared ? <continued_utterance> i could be you rguard ! i could carry your spear !
what a great son you are , <person> . i wish i could take you with me . now go to sleep . <person> slides down under his blankets . <person> kisses him , looks at him a moment , then quietly withdraws to- ward the fire .
why don ' t you folks have a seat . make yourself at home . it ' s gon na be a while .
<person> , that ' s it . i ' ve had enough of the waiting room now .
do your friend a favor , <person> , keep him quiet . mcmanus you ' re clean , <person> ? say it ain ' t so . was it you that hit that truck ?
forget him . it ' s not important . i was trying to make a point .
this is therapy !

thought you were going to buy a car .
still am . there ' s more gold than i thought , and since there ' s only two of us now . where should i go ?
<person> , listen to me very carefully . if there ' s a man in the house , if there ' s any reason why you can ' t talk to me right now , just answer yes to me over the phone . that ' s all . if there ' s any danger of any kind , just say yes .
i don ' t understand what ' s happening . what man in the house ?
the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they ' re interested in putting <person> <number> out of business .
all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
you wan na check it out ? come here . <continued_utterance> first we ' ve got <person> , the psycho looking biker . in charge of transportation and smuggling . controls every trucking union in eastern europe . <person> ' t look too clean , either . <continued_utterance> next we got a siberian redneck , <person> . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .
i just mean , i -- i guess <person> isn ' t going to be there when you get home .
are you holding me up or am i dragging you down ?
what ' s gotten into you ?
you were chasing me in florida .
i ' m talkin ' his spiritual mother . <person> .
his spiritual mother .
what do you mean , walked ?
your aliens , <person> , your little green men , first landed here millions of years ago . those that didn ' t leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age . in the form of an evolved pathogen . waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet . using us as hosts . <person> this we have no defense . nothing but a weak vaccine . do you see why it was kept secret ? why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known ? <continued_utterance> <person> , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
<person> good .
my battery ' s going . i ' m a block away . see you in five minutes .

<person> , if you ever need to buy a rug .
hey , <person> . why don ' t you try this : <continued_utterance> <person> ' t shoot me , i ' m friendly . you can use that when you surrender .

i don ' t want to hear any tales about colored people .
but these are white people , anybody . the punch .
he ' s not the murderer . but he ' s a bozo .
yes , he is like a clown .
<person> ?

mr . <person> ? .
it ' s going to be all right , son .
you might have killed him !
<person> , check the barns . i ' ll watch these two .
but that ' s my calling , my purpose , my raison d ' etre . <person>s are supposed to make people laugh . and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
and when they ' re done laughin ' , they ' re gon na call the cops . that guy <person> would rat on you for a nickel !
i told the guy i didn ' t want to talk to .
i ' ll just take a minute . <person> . you know what i ' m talking about . the case is going to trial . our chief witness is a dr . <person> , you know who he is ?
it ' ll never feel right .

quince .
<person> .

you won ' t .
but i might .
<person> por favor ! <person> !
what ' re you talking about ?
oh .

i ' m sure . pretty sure . <continued_utterance> it ' s like the wind . i can ' t see it but i feel it .
we can measure wind .
no . <continued_utterance> in the aftermath of the battle , i went into the temple , and i found a baby . small for a giant ' s offspring -- abandoned , suffering , left to die . <person> ' s son .
<person> ' s son . <continued_utterance> why ? you were knee-deep in jotun blood . why would you take me ?

they said you had to run out .
yeah . it was a rush thing . they needed some documents down at the court house . i barely made it .
<person> , i ' m going to jail and you know it .
maybe that ' s the price , <person> , maybe so . it ' s gon na be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way , that ' s the best thing that can happen to you . stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life , create , don ' t live off the buying and selling of others .
i ' m so sorry .
<person> ' t know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
nine hundred and fifty two .
i was forced to hire a caddy for my loose change .
<person> ? and what are you going to do tonight ?
i ' m going to get laid .
no . just fossils , far as i know .
i ' d like this person to take a look , if you don ' t mind .
and your wife left you .
is that in my chart ?
hey , <person> . what do you think , leave the tent or maybe take it with us ?
i was just seeing if you were paying attention .
i don ' t think he ' ll come back here . <continued_utterance> thanks . for all your help . <continued_utterance> i know it wasn ' t easy . maybe , someday , i ' ll be able to .
i wish you wouldn ' t leave me altogether . <continued_utterance> i ' m not a young woman anymore . i ' ve given up all my dreams of the future . now , i just want to make it to the end . you know what i mean . <person> smiles at her gently . he knows exactly what she means .

that ' s a lie !
he ' s my brother .
oh .

uh . <person> likes to trade ; no one stops by here without gettin ' stuck in the old indian barter . he , uh . he likes your shades .
i left my number on your fridge .
come here , i want to tell you a secret .

of course . you ' d need -
<person> , <person> , about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i ' m going i swear i ' ll --
two-hundred .
i saw the way he looked at you .
it was a play .
what am i going to do ? my only son will be sent to prison ! <continued_utterance> oh , lance , can ' t something be done ?

a fucking moron .
<person> , i don ' t want to play this game anymore .
it ' s an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it ' s based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they ' ve done something wrong . or the level of what they ' ve done wrong .
they ' ll take care of themselves .
i ' m very worried about my body .

you ' re fired !
i ' m a walking coincidence . i can ' t count ' em . no something ' s happening , <person> . i ' ve got to get to the bottom of it .
of
dividend . i figure i owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes .
. don ' t be crazy . put it to your school loans .
i can ' t hardly believe it . it ' s working out just like you said , <person> . we ' re lootin ' this burg six ways through sunday .
pretty fun too , isn ' t it ?
if i can smoke it .
you want a muffin ?
did he have any money with him ?
probably . but not more than , say , fifty dollars . some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward , for which they are paid . it ' s part of the rehabilitation .
we ' ve been hailing the groznyy for the last hour , mr . secretary . the groznyy refuses to stop .

that ' s <person> .
and just who the hell is <person> ?
what about you ? where are you going ?
back to work .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man ' s wallet .
that ' s because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
mostly , he is absent . i ' ve barely seen his majesty since our wedding , and that was three months ago . whenever he ' s around me , he has nothing to say .
arranged marriages can be difficult . your father and i thought yours would bring <person> and france closer together .
the sun is setting , <person> . youandiacute ; ve been asleep for nineteen hours .
what did she do to me ?
a small thing . nothing really .
does this offer include my partner ?
i mean the musketeers have been disbanded . <person> free to poke around for souvenirs .
what do you mean ' disbanded ' ?
from a dea standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds . and cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training .
come on . i want to hear from everyone : fbi . <person> . treatment . is there anyone from treatment on this plane ? then i want an answer for why there isn ' t anyone from treatment . <person> , we know we have to bust one of these cartels , <person> or tijuana , not just as a symbol , but hell yes , also as a symbol - they are symbols - and there ' s nothing wrong with sending a message . that ' s why when <person> hired <person> lead defense , i flew <person> to san diego to prosecute . because he ' s the best we have , he ' s our symbol that we ' re serious about putting the top people away . so , as of right now , this flight only , consider the dam on new ideas thrown open . <continued_utterance> if i ' m not mistaken , we got dea , pentagon , u . s . attorneys office , about a billion dollars of budget right here . so what are you people waiting for ?
what are you going to do ? drink it ?
watching <person> in there . gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole . every piece of you is self-sufficient , an animal unto itself . when a man bleeds it ' s just tissue . but blood from one of you <person> won ' t obey . it ' s a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life . when attacked , your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say .
why ?
i didn ' t want to bring up memories . i didn ' t want to do anything that might make you regret your choices . <continued_utterance> besides , dad would have freaked .
funerals aren ' t exactly memorable .
god no . all those horrible loved ones and relatives . i don ' t want to talk to those people . i just want to . talk to my father . i loved him . i ' m not sure he knew that .
where is <person> ? how far is it ?
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by <person> many years ago . her name is <person> .
i ' m glad you came . i ' ll see you in my office next month .
that ' s it ?
<person>h , just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the soviets ' ll do the same in cuba .
i don ' t want to listen to this again .
well , <person> . they ' ve been exceptionally supportive .
are they hitting you up for donations ? asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee ?
<person> , a <person> . it was the guy who killed <person> ' s mother .
<person> ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable . a smear on the drafting board .
that ' s like twenty minutes from school !
all right , all right , so i lied .
<person> . you wanted me to kill her .
a man doesn ' t always mean the things he says .

hold the fuckin ' phone . you and <person> ? no , no , no . mcmanus guys , come on . <continued_utterance> i ' m sure you can understand my hesitation .
come on , <person> <continued_utterance> it ' s like that movie <continued_utterance> this one ' s almost thirty years old . it ' s about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love .
that ' s exactly why i don ' t watch ' em anymore -- it ' s bullshit ! why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid ?
<person> ' s mosey over to the post office , i ' m expecting a letter any day .
oh , i beg your pardon , sir . that ' s what i came over to give you , it slipped my mind .
my god .
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization .
unlimited funds ?
unlimited .
i am funny . i ' m real funny .

maybe it does . <person> ' t patronize me <person> .
we didn ' t find anybody like that in the yard or the house .
no . it ' s not possible . she turns , looks around , but spies nothing .
it ' s the only way out .
i can ' t breathe , i can ' t breathe .

it ' s deputy breakenridge .
<person> ! <person> , we was afraid-
it ' s your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
a fed , i shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you ' re gon na hit me with the sales pitch .
<person> away from there .
<person> number ?
perhaps <person> had a word with the man upstairs .
a word ? i ' m sure by now he ' s engineered a hostile takeover .
who ? there ' s no one around .
you remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like <person> . and your teacher , <person> said , `` you ' re too late , <person> . there ' s nothing left to explore . `` and all the other kids laughed .
when you look at architecture , try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism .
<person> !
is this your house ?
oh . i ' m sorry . <person> , what do you say ?
that ' s not how i do things .
well , then you ' re looking at foreclosure . <person> gets up and storms out of the office .
-you ' ve been drawing him off . and the more he sees you the less he ' ll think of anything other than getting you . now find <person> and take him alive . do not let <person> get to him . as a potential major case witness against the lapd , <person> magdalena isn ' t just a powder- keg , he ' s an atom bomb .
<person> has a bigger angle and i ' m getting close to it . i just haven ' t hit home . yet .
that ' s it . ? come on , guys . life is too short . you tell me if you ' re playing ' chicken , ' or you mean it . <person> : i don ' t think i ' m talking out of school , but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand . and that ' s a lot of money . and if i may say , you haven ' t got the best of records .

i ' m afraid he ' s pretty worn out , poor kid .
nevertheless . there ' s a police officer
no . you ' ve always been crazy . this is just the first chance you ' ve had to really express yourself .
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty .
he knows me ?
he says he saw you in a vision some time ago . <continued_utterance> i guess he had this vision some time ago , in the moon of the popping trees -- uh , back in the winter . he says you come from wasi ' cu city in the east but that your people . way back . are of the minniconjou sioux . but you yourself don ' t know that . <continued_utterance> he says he knew you ' d be coming to <person> . he was told . it is the will of tunkasilia -- the grandfather that you come here . he says let ' s smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe , symbol of truth . so that there will be no lies between us .
that ' s not solid .

code of the streets , <person> . code of the streets .
then what are you planning to do ?
not really . i ' d say that <person> is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk <person> , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in london , a dealer representing the saudi <person> offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa . although . i don ' t know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it ' s a sacrilege having that pre-columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray .
i gather you ' re a decorator .
this is about sex , not like . <person> , <person> ' s here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins . you want a muffin ?
if i can smoke it .
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .
a hundred and . now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk : i don ' t care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller . you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <continued_utterance> what ' d you say to me !
now ! we ' ll finish them together !
silence !
yes .
what about the women ?
<person> ! <person> de <person> !
you tread on my boy ' s face . you
i ' m sorry .
do you know how many times i ' ve had someone die on me ? how many children ?
. i ' m kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts . it ' s a long and worthy story but i won ' t trouble you with it right now .
are you expecting someone ?
<number> , <number> . no .
and you moved to new york . to dance and paint and act and deal arms .
<person> , do you remember <person> ?
who ?
it means she ' s insecure .
about what ?
what are you talking about . this match box ?
it ' s got a lot of overhead to it . what do you do . spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen , that ' s all . so why do you need a living room and a dining room . <continued_utterance> why do ya need a back yard ?
damn you , <person> ! you ' ve already got everybody half-hysterical around here .
you can ' t let anybody leave !
where ' d they find the body ?
in a big red bag on the front passenger seat . all hacked up -- fucking gruesome -- a real psycho , this one .
<person> ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i ' m gon na give you another hole to breathe out of .
get him ! find out who he is !
<person> . <continued_utterance> now what ' s this big deal you wanted to discuss ? i shouldn ' t even talk to you after canceling out on my show .
<person> , i saw the old man .
why , you don ' t want us to bring him over ?
no , it ' s that when do you have time to be parents to him ? you guys don ' t pick him up until nine , ten at night . you are into yourselves , as the saying goes . spend some time trying to be parents . <person> him to the mountains , fishing . you ought to let him get to know nature .
we ' ll go around that way , come up on foot .
<person> ! get down !
i ' ve discovered something about <person> ' <number> maestro teaching tool i thought you should know . the harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . <person> intended to hurt the kids using it .
<person> . i know who the dominant personality is . <person> . <person> ' s reaction is one of panic . she bolts toward their squad car with all the speed she has . <person> chases after her . <continued_utterance> where the hell are you going ?
you and i are the same , <person> . we ' re smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love . a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
you ' re really twisted , <person> . you ' re incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there ' s a poverty that every last dollar in the world won ' t fill .
for the good of the people .
for the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne .
<person> , look at yourself !
just a little car trouble , hon . i ' m fine .
<person> , <person> . no vendettas on my ship . now : remember what i told you about <person> ? watch the grass , watch the trees , watch the shit house , be on your toes , and if we get committed , don ' t hesitate to empty that sucker .
<person> . <person> .
plenty , i ' m sure . but , for what it ' s worth . <continued_utterance> . i like her .
me too .
i ' m just kidding . i just thought . just thought i ' d check up on her . <person> , after that , i don ' t really know . i ' ve been thinking about <person> a lot . i still got some friends out there . i don ' t really know . <person> , i ' ll write you .
you will ?
i regret , <person> of my life , my father has lost his job and i will now be forced to go to public school .
how unfortunate . what did he do ?
<person> care of him ?
yes .
and when you turned her toward the door , where did you expect her to go , without a car ?
again . i think we covered this . i told her i was going to call a cab .
what class sub does your nephew run ?
c-class .
we did .
<person> ' t you read ?
i have no problem with that .
somebody ' s butt is gon na bar-b-que .
. yes ?
first , that boat is in international waters . i ' m claiming it for salvage .
it ' s a nightclub , not a drive-in , <person> . i don ' t follow the customers to the parking lot .
<person> , <person> . go on home . we might have to call you in for some more questioning .
which means .
you ' ll have to start going to . <continued_utterance> <person> .
you ' re going to put your theories to practice . i ' m sending you into the field .
quite an improvement . <person> well above the collar standard , l . a . p . d . regulation . what exactly am i going to be doing in the field ?
no . what does that mean ?
it means you shouldn ' t be taking care of another kid . especially a convict .
never turn your radio off ! i thought i was gon na find you scalped ! damn it !
<person> , <person> . i lost <person> --
i . i just want you to be happy , <person> .
but i think i ' d be happiest . with you .
<person> . i have the child .
we must start the ritual ! <continued_utterance> who is that ?
indian kids . hunting fossils .
<person> . i think <person> and i can proceed from here . what are your call signals ?
why don ' t you start fucking her again . you can spend it together . <continued_utterance> i hate you !
you see . i couldn ' t stay , even if i wanted to .
you can kill me . but a surprise waits for you in england . that even <person> can ' t prevent .
what . surprise ?
outta my job , outta queens . <continued_utterance> it doesn ' t mean anything .
sure and go where ?
thanks for your help , <person> . <person> we woke you up .
that ' s alright . i was having a bad dream . i was dreamin ' about a joke with no punchline .
who am i ?
i don ' t know .
<person> , <person> ? hardly my political base .
they ' ve got parents . besides they ' re photogenic .
is she alive ?
yes . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite prepared to tell you everything , though there isn ' t much you haven ' t guessed .
i volunteer . i read to blind people . one day a week for two hours .
in school ?
is that why you want to finish the pipeline ?
partially , yes .
are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference ?
alphabetically seems . fair .
what about the blood ?
could be hers . types match . could be a lot of other people ' s too .
i know that . i know what ' s at stake here .
no , i don ' t think you do . and besides . i haven ' t decided yet .
<person> .
<person> did you do it , <person> ? <person> did you come back from the dead ?
first tell us why you did it .
why i did it ? i don ' t know . <person> ? i thought i was doing the guy a favor .
you know theres somethin i aint never told you about , sailor , and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things to happen . when i was almost sixteen i got pregnant .
<person> been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time . what did you do , your mama find out ?
i will , darling .
and don ' t worry about <person> . he ' ll be waiting for you too .
everyone has got ta be concerned about <person> conlon ' s bravery getting him into trouble here .
his bravery can get him killed , <person> . he ' s got nothing more to prove . he ' s already lasted two rounds against koba , which is more than anyone else can say . you wonder what ' s keeping this guy up .
i think so .
where ?
my folks split my freshman year , so i spend the holidays racing between them . two trees . two turkey dinners . two sets of presents to return for store credit . so normally i can deal , but this year mom decided to rent a condo at the beach . which is like , what ? two hours away .
i don ' t know . the beach can be sort of nice in the winter . romantic .
<person> . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
no , i ' m holding for <person> . in chairs . <person> . <person> .
<person> .
you say its straight ahead a mile ?
it ' s the official scout magazine . tells about what it means to be a scout , what kind of boy you need to be , and , oh , about merit badges and stuff like that .
' suggested good turns a scout can do : assist a foreign boy with some english grammar . <person> put out a burning field . give water to a crippled dog . ' i could do those .
i suppose not . your heart is set on being a musketeer . when i was your age , i too had dreams of joining the musketeers .
you , <person> ?
arrested ? ! ?
for grand theft auto . they found his prints in your father ' s car .
yeah .
how come you go to dad ? are you really sick or just maladjusted ?
maybe milking .
milking ?

<person> , i thought i mentioned that to you .

<person> what , i ' m an opium fiend ? no , <person> , i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night .
<person> , <person> , i know you ' re-
if they land --
if they land , we can take them . if they don ' t land , then we ' ve got nothing to worry about .
your father .
is nothing . his kingdom he stole from my mother . the kingdom i will rightly take back . <person> leaves . <person> is left alone with m .
yes , sir !
and you two charming ladies , i want you to know i ' m looking forward to your show this evening . whatever your audience lacks in numbers , it will make up for in enthusiasm -- or i ' ll know the reason why !
<person> ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
i do ?
it ' s the woman .
i thought you said it was a virus ?
no .
i ' <number> get right to the point . i ' m smarter than you . i ' <number> find out what i want to know and i ' <number> get it from you whether you like it or not .
would you be addressing me , sir ?
i would .
do you have a condom ? <continued_utterance> it has to be in a safe place . a nice comfortable bed . with no threat of interruptions . and for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine , preferably french . i want a new condom . not one that ' s been riding around in your wallet for years . consumers rated them a while back . i suggest you get their top-rated brand . this may take some research in the library . i ' d appreciate a photocopy of the article . <person> , for supplementary protection , i want a name brand spermicide .
how about i have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side ?
i . i ' m totally . i don ' t know what to say .
well , you could always say `` yes . `` or you could think about it first .
i arrived this morning .
you ' ve been . busy .
oh shit ! we sure as hell can ' t hand her the baby with an ass full of dope . right in front of the narcs ! <continued_utterance> what should we do ? i really got ta go .
<person> , she ' s just had her bottle . she ' s sleeping like a log . <person> ' s just leave her in the apartment . what can possibly happen to her ? she ' s as regular as clockwork . she won ' t wake up till <number> : <number> and we ' ll easily be back by then .
i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t . v .
you have good instincts when it comes to things like that ?
<person> ? <person> , a whole year .
<person> , she was going to get rich . she was blackmailing somebody .
four !
what is it out there , anyway ? forty- five knots ?
you ! everything ! the guy-
what guy ?
what about the other guy ?
he ' s a pilot .
oh , c ' mon , that ' s impossible -- you see i have a baby . i have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes , i can ' t go anywhere . i live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and i ' ll get you my license immediately . you can even come with me if you like .
all right , lead the way .
he ' s been under a lot of pressure recently . he snapped . he had a nervous breakdown . it ' s the saddest thing i ' ve ever seen . <person> ' s be honest about it , nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars ' worth of aluminum siding free .
i thought it was very generous , but sometimes the lord moves in mysterious ways .
for once , our son needs something we can not provide .
i can fight it a little longer .
the dogs ?
screw the dogs ! ! torch it ! !
he ' s over at the house . we ' re doing a little training at <person> ' s . remember <person> ' s ? it ain ' t <person> ' s anymore .
you and <person> are training together ?
just kills me .
i love you dad .
i know , but who was he ? where ' d he go ? it ' s like one minute there ' s a , a gun to my head and the next all the lights go out and he ' s gone , like a , like a-
ghost .
which way you headed ?
i ' m just goin ' to see <person> at dawson ' s .
no way ! it was your idea . you go first .
we both bite at the same time .
one kiss . <continued_utterance> that smile is gon na be the end of me .
and what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> is everything going to be okay , <person> ?
yeah , <person> . everything ' s gon na be fine .
you haven ' t been in any trouble ? good . how ' re you and <person> ?
he made us all snowcream , like he said .
i got ta go .
you weren ' t there , you don ' t know what happened .
this is my mother and father . they were very special to me . <person> sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave . i think people should know that .
would you care to comment on the fall of leon to the rebels ?
you ' re like a kid , you ' re coming in here like it ' s saturday night , you want me to say that you ' ve got a fever -- you don ' t have to go to school .
you , you don ' t under .
but you could call him and ask him to call me .
it ' s awfully late . <continued_utterance> stay on the line , <person> . what ' s your number in case we get disconnected ?
<person> . i can ' t take the rejection . i ' m going to class .
<person> ' t .
i resent your tone , sir . i have men who are missing -
and i have the entire british economy to worry about .
oh god .
everything okay here ? neighbors said they heard a lady scream .
thanks , <person> . thanks for everything .
you ' re a great kid . <person> ' t you forget it .
who made this ?
i did .
meet my partner , <person> .
i did . at blue balls .
certainly . <continued_utterance> you can understand how a man could go off like that . i mean , a big , faceless organization like yours , coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property . <continued_utterance> . is how he described it .
that doesn ' t explain how he managed to tear through our security .
i will -- i ' ll getcha water -- getcha lotsa water -- anything you say -- !
<person> ! <continued_utterance> you ' re a weasely little <person> ! gim me some water !
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr . <person> ?
as far as we know , nothing .
<person> .
my handwriting is so bad that now i can ' t even read it . you girls better hurry up and graduate from high school so you can take care of me .
<person> ' t thank me . i only did it for <person> .
are you in love with her ?
i wish i knew , <person> . i wish i knew who he was , and i ' ve got ta say the fact that i don ' t know is strange . in an internet age where there are no secrets , this guy is a complete mystery . i can ' t find out anything about him . <person> <person> is officially <person> proof .
you got ta love this guy , <person> . no walk out music , no sponsors , no interviews . he skipped out on the press conference . <person> ' t have his picture take for the program . he ' s breaking every rule !
thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this game ' s about your testosterone count .
two-fifteen to carry , and the tour star ' s laying up .
there is no wind .
an old house creaks . <continued_utterance> go - close the shutters .
you really think your icicles are a match for <person>ian steel ? <continued_utterance> fair enough . <continued_utterance> could we stop just a moment while i get another sword ?
that ' s unfortunate .
well , hope to hear from you , sir .
ok gang , looks like we ' re going over <number> % in teldar , start the lawyers on a tender offer and <number> d , we keep going after everything in sight but don ' t pay over $ <number> . they ' re gon na fight , they got myers and thromberg doing their legal , they make <person> look like nice guys .
that ' s exactly why i don ' t watch ' em anymore -- it ' s bullshit ! why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid ?
the point is , love isn ' t about money or social standing or age , it ' s about
oh , nothin . i never let on to mama about <person> bein the one . i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was ? i didn't tell <person> , neither . he was back home in chattanooga by then , anyhow , and i didn't see the point . somethin terrible happened to him , though . six months ago .
whats that , peanut ?
ow ! ow ! it ' s broken !
no it isn ' t ! you may have a bad sprain , but no bones are busted !
impossible .
it couldn ' t be .
<person> . x <number> .
i read , <person> .
`` you can ' t shoot ' em ! '' i like that . i bet she led you on good , didn ' t she ? taking you up to the house to hang drapes . oh that ' s a good one . bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face . i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . then me busting in like some wild bear . ha ! bet you had a fire going under you .
like you don ' t know .
oh , that ' s very kind of you -- very kind .
well , oh , dear -- i don ' t quite see .
come here . <continued_utterance> there ' s something in your past ; something you want to keep hidden . there ' s a pain . something . someone you can ' t forget . and there is something you want very badly . it seems very far away to you , but you are determined , and you will do what you must to get it .
my face tell you all that ?
i don ' t know , i ' m very confused right now .
did you ever find out what it wanted ?
should have at least gotten the map off of him . <person> up with him then we did all this for nothing .
<person> ?
where ?
he ' s in that old flophouse . <person> . <person> .
<person> , <person> , this is something we came up with ?
yeah , that ' s right . so now that you know , you understand why it ' s important that we get it back .
this man ' s family will want to see the body laid to rest .
tell them he was trying to save the young boy ' s life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .
you don ' t just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman .
we can do this . we can get her out of here .
hey , look , she ' s waking up .
oh no , this can ' t be happening !
yes ! i ' s here .
<person> - more money than sense . <person> ?
well , whatever the hell happened it ' s just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place .
you got that right .
<person> .
<person> .
you ' re not civil , you ' re glum . we got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me . <person> freezes as a bell goes off in his head . earl oh my god . she got to you . you <continued_utterance> she just practically asked you for a date . what the hell is wrong ? !
<person> , get real . what does she need with a guy like me ?
the guy might not have been carrying anything .
or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants .
i tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones . <person> aint bad , though . <person> gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle . <continued_utterance> whats wrong , sweetheart ? somethin botherin you ?
mama . i been thinkin about her .
it was really stupid .
<person> . it was stupid . you could have killed yourself .
are you sure ?
everything ' s fine . why ? what ' s -- ?
i ' m going to help her .
to do what . ? to do what , for chrissake . ? to help her to do what ? she ' s dead .
depends , if it was a continuing problem , i might recommend a mild sedative .
i knew you ' d say something like that , you jerk !
<person> ' t worry about it . i just need to make a call . can you get practice started ?
really ? you want me to slap your face ? get you psyched up for the call ?
it pushes on my neck .
what ?
you ' re not a burden , you ' re my husband .
i want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me . all you ' ve ever known is duty . to me and to a political career that unless i can walk no longer exists . you ' ve been exemplary . now i ' m telling you you ' re free to go .
or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see .
you have great power , heimdall .
<person> , your father ' s in the next office . you should ' ve seen him get upset at <person> ' s party about your photo here .
he ' s always been jealous of you . you know that .
please , professor , why can ' t we go along with you ? <continued_utterance> . polite ! we haven ' t been asked yet .
he ' s perfectly welcome . as one dog to another , huh ? here now -- let ' s see where were we ? <continued_utterance> oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ?
yes , i do , <person> .
then please approach .
you ' re a peach .
funny you should say that . my grandfather was a peach farmer . ouch . for the first time , that really smarts .
you know , <person> . `` oh , <person> '' . `` <person> '' , <person> ' -foster !
i see , well this happens to be a nocturne .
you didn ' t happen to talk to <person> today , did you ?
<person> , i talked to him .
what about id ' s ?
one to seven : deal the face cards .
confusing . but not really . because it ' s nothing .
where did you meet him ?
<person> said . i ' m impressed .
i was momentarily inspired .
know what i think ?
what ?
well , <person> did call me into his office today . and he did tell me i didn ' t have my old job anymore .
<person> , what did you get ?
did you kill him ?
athos . the spy . is a woman .
so how can i help ?
<person> has decided that she wants a more active role in her father ' s care .
no . but she ' s here with an attorney .
hi <person> . hi , i ' m <person> flaherty .
<person> , <person> . if the zodiac killer calls , be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right .
i thought maybe you ' d won a radio contest or something . is that single-spaced ?
you can ' t go . you ' re my guest of honor .
fuck you , <person> . you ' re paying me to write my novel , so you own me .
federal bureau of investigation , <person> .
well , little fella , we don ' t need any outside help here . i don ' t like you people sniffin ' around my neck of the woods . in fact , when the state boys called me about a `` j . <person> '' coming up i think i said , `` so what ? ''
<person> for the sky ! !
huh ?
who ?
the young man who rescued us from the bandit .
any thoughts on why anybody ' d be growing corn in the middle of the desert ?
not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there .
sure . more money in intelligence on their side of the border . so we have a better idea who we ' re looking for . more dogs . more people . supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through . outside of martial law that ' s about the best you ' re gon na do . but , i should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . in the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we ' re pulling over the same number of cars . what does that tell you ?
that triple the amount of stuff is going through .
<person> leave .
<person> , come on .
just a place .
really , <person> , this aint right !
i love you . now give me the line .
no little girl can ever make me come .
<person> ' t even start . i ' ll be honest , i don ' t trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?
the people i know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . they ' re interested in putting <person> <number> out of business .
you know . rest areas are homosexual hang-outs .
<person> ?
get in the car .
hi ! this is <person> . it must be fate that i found you so quickly ! <person> stops and stands , a little out of breath . <continued_utterance> is this a bad time ?
the prom -- you going ?
oh , i don ' t know . i think proms are pretty dumb .
<person> . i liked what the old woman said about us earlier .
what did she say ?
yeah . well , i ' ve got a little problem . the guys at the bank want to take my house away . that ' s kind of why i came to see you , actually .
i ' ve got most of my dough tied up in this joint , but how much do you need ?
<person> ? i don ' t understand .
it ' s very simple . ya know , we ' re doing this layout about the benefits of aluminum siding -- a ' before ' and ' after ' kind of presentation .
they ' ll ask questions ; want to know why we were out here .
we ' ll lie .
<person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> here .
i ' m not wearing that thing !
we dont have no paper bags .
<person> . <person> , mama , im on my way . thanks for waitin , gentlemen .
not until my car ' s fixed . i don ' t know how long that ' s going to take .
and here i ' ve made you all hot and sweaty .
we ' re getting out of this place . we ' ve done enough .
wait a minute , whoa . we can ' t go now . what ' s <person> got planned with that nerve agent ?
i ' ve seen worse .
<person> was <person> . <person> specialist . letac surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building . <continued_utterance> we don ' t know how , but <person> <number> . <number> made himself into an android .
the car ' s still in town , daddy .
what ?
somewhere else ? mister , somewhere else is fifty miles from here . only other gas station down in town closed <number> years ago when the mine got shut .
<person> , i ' m stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?
no . not that i can think of .
<person> ? you know we never fire anybody .
<person> didn ' t kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
<person> did this wanted to do <person> one better to improve upon what was already done .
a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to principal dick <person>in ?
i ' m warning you .
what i ' m saying , they ' re getting some help .
so what do you want me to do ? concannon ' s going to try the case his way , i ' m going to try it mine . you want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he ' s got some flack , got stories in the newspaper . i ' m going to win this case . they start walking across the courthouse corridor . <person> veers off and stops at a cigar stand .
what about tipping off <person> ?
if i ever need surgery , get me the heart of an arb like <person> , it ' s never been used . <person> .
what ' ve i got to lose ? you okay , <person> ?
yeah . they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
<person> ' t be ridiculous . she ' s only -- how old is she ?
fourteen , <person> .
oh . thank you .
but i ' m not sure it would have been a good idea then either . i ' m going through a really hard time right now and i just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self-destructive thing i could possibly do .
i need to find my daughter . i ' ll pay you .
who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i shouldn ' t just put you in a dumpster ?
you said to leave it , remember ? we walked home .
the rain ' s bound to let up . <person> can go then .
i think it was better when i didn ' t . it was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world . as <person> dwells on this , <person> bursts out laughing . <continued_utterance> what ' s so funny ?
i ' m sorry , it ' s just that you ' re taking this all wrong , pal . <person> ' t you see ? you ' re <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> , i was only four towns away . <person> thinks it over .
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . <person> almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn ' t have to slaughter your sow .
the lesson being ?
and with my magic i ' ll send her into the . into the . he gropes for a word . bavmorda laughs at him .
you ' re no magician .
it was the feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , <person> comes down on n . y . p . d . for some answers - they come up with us . they ' re grabbing at straws . it ' s politics - nothing you can do .
i had a guy ' s fingers in my asshole tonight .
why are you talking like that ?
listen to me carefully . first of all , <person> isn ' t here . dea ' s got him and they ' ll hang on to him until arraignment , which will probably be tomorrow . so here you ' re wasting your time . are you with me ? <continued_utterance> good . from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded , that the movement of your lips is being read .
not you . your talent .
you ' re lying .
excuse me ?
i didn ' t change the colors on your stupid computer screen .
you don ' t think what ?
whatever that last thing you said was .
do i call you dr . <person> or <person> ?
whichever you prefer . have a seat .
<person> ' s out sick and can ' t find anything without her . it sucks .
who was that guy ?
how ' s your cold ?
my ears are blocked , my nose is clogged .
i got ta go . i ' m sorry --
where do you have to go ?
these pecks make terrible nurse- maids .
<person> ? !
how old are you ?
i am seventy-four years old .
<person> ' t there anything i can say that ' ll change your mind ? you ' re gon na stay with your new friends ?
' least they don ' t scare women .
<person> buddy . i got to be near , <person> . it ' s good luck .
<person> ' s who ?
you hit me , <person> ? you hit a woman , you motherfucker ! <person> ' t your momma ever teach you anything . ? <continued_utterance> well ?
well , nothing . we dump <person> , we split the money , then you ' re on your own .
<person> , sometimes i got ta admit , you come up with some weird thoughts .
<person> interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts , <person> . you tell me <person> , who could come up with shit like were seein these days ?
you don ' t love me ?
i love you , too , <person> damn it !
you don ' t want to be at crossroads without one . it ' s a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .
i thought you weren ' t old fashioned .
<person> , you ' re bleeding . i forgot you got hit .
what ' s that ?
they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .
i guess .
someone ' s gon na take it .
then you better get out there soon .
i find it hard to believe myself .
his lips , unused as they are to such a contortion , twisted and stretched . into a smile .
what was that ?
`` what are you thinking ? '' . that was it . the hours are hell , but the money ' s starting to tumble in . i know this guy who ' s got an iron- clad way to make money , i can ' t lose and i can ' t get hurt .
go ahead .
if she can ' t sing in the key of c i ' m in trouble .
i ' m not sure yet , but i ' m starting to believe that everything happens for a reason . <person> , why did i eat the forbidden fruit ?
to get laid ?
no problem --
and you have to meet my father .
i don ' t know .
just one more -- thank you . i thought you knew everything ?
no . you ' re with who you should be . it ' s like she chose you .
and i have no idea why .
how do you know he ' s still not here ?
guys like me take those chances . <person> ' s go .
i ' m through improvising .
<person> told me about <person> . is it true ? did you lose it all ?
the truce with <person> is conditional upon your exile .
but couldn ' t we find a way to --
what happened to you ?
oh god .
he killed her . i ' m not crazy . he killed her and --
this is the feur thing ?
the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr . <person> . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london doesn ' t carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .
i ' ll keep that in mind .
wrap it up .
you ' ve made a considerably wise decision .
it was closed . i was going to leave a note , but i didn ' t . you know . <person> anything to write with .
but those places are supposed to stay open <number> / <number> ! why wasn ' t it open ?
to replace a goddamn radiator hose ! ?
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half <person> . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
i see him .
<person> !
to put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works .
my mother lives alone .
more money than you ever dreamed , <person> . and the thing is no one gets hurt . how bout a beer ?
too much to do . but i ' ll walk you out .
<person> .
<person> . we hear the door close .
but they look good on you .
how do you know ? i don ' t wear them outside my dorm .
an old case . can you find him ?
yes . maybe not tomorrow , maybe not this week , but i ' ll find him .
`` thou , the player of the game , art god . `` very spiritual . <person> , too . god , the artist . the mechanic . <person> .
those are sterile , are they ?
the only one who thinks you ' re chosen is you , so shut up already !
<person> , be mad , but i ' m going to get us out of here , if it ' s the last thing i do .
no , i won ' t . because the man who ' s coming here tonight is completely unlike you . the man who is coming here is kind and funny -- he has the most wonderful sense of humor --
but he ' s not here .
no excuses , no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit for presentation ! i want a full practice charge tomorrow .
<person> .
nice work if you can get it , and you can get it if you try . any scotch left ?
<person> , here , i just put it away .
it ' s pleasant down that way , too .
that ' s funny . <person> ' t he pointing the other way ?
' that which does not kill me makes me stronger . '
now <person> is dead . he got his revenge .
f don ' t want any of the bodies taken away until i ' ve had a chance to go over this , understood ?
i have to clear the scene . i ' ve got word direct from the chief baer lights a cigarette , only half listening .
you ' re implying she ' s , what , a gold digger ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' s right . <person> is so unattractive .
second only to unbridled , narcissistic conceit .
<person> . <person> .
i think you ' ve got some issues to deal with . really , when we get out of here i ' m pretty sure it ' s shrink time for you .
no ! this smug asshole insulted you and i want him to take it back .
we ' re not really that insulted --
all you really do is this incredibly noble thing -- <person> nods .
but i don ' t know if i --
pretty much .
<person> . then you can go home .
yes .
and the windows ?
pulsating laserlight !
total annihilation !
<person> , you ' re being silly .
did you think i didn ' t know ?
<person> ?
four kids , three different guys .
tell me some other things about her .
she ' s in high school . she ' s sexually active . she ' s on drugs . she ' s crying out for some help .
we still have to get him to a hospital .
after we get a reading on the storm ?
it ' s bullshit . this guy could be l . a . p . d . i think it ' s a setup .
the way i hear it , <person> is some kind of butcher . no pity .
i barfed . <person> to make it to the bathroom . <person> out it was the wrong door anyways . i sorta got it cleaned up .
you sick ?
you can ' t .
no calling <person> .
i know the name . why ?
old friend of your father ' s . <continued_utterance> back at the department of state . we were what you might call fellow travelers , but his disenchantment outlasted mine . i never believed in the project . <continued_utterance> oh , come on . <person> ' t pretend you don ' t know about the project . your father died for it . your sister was taken because of it .
call off the manhunt looking for me . i didn ' t kill the transport guards .
it ' s already been called off . witnesses confirmed you weren ' t the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?
if i told you . that i think <person> ' s innocent . but i ' m in over my head . would you believe me ?
see those black <person> out there , <person> ? when the people lost the land in <number> , the government took everything but those hills . they allowed us to keep those black <person> , to live there . signed a treaty . until they found gold . then they told us we had to leave because of national interest . they broke that treaty . anyone who fought or spoke out against it , wound up dead or in jail . and the people wound up here . on a reservation . <continued_utterance> while up there , in the black <person> . they carved the faces of four presidents . <continued_utterance> your relatives must ' ve taught you something .
you drank a little too much . call me tomorrow if you want .
tomorrow i ' ll wish i was dead .
it ' s not true . right , <person> ?
well , funny story there . you see , uh , it started out as a uh . yeah . it ' s true . = <person> stands up .
well , that ' s very nice of him .
that ' s not my dad . that ' s my nephew --
<person> ?
. i ' d head for <person> .
yes .
<person> . i was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?
it ' s right there on your golf bag .
what are you doing with all these blueprints ?
i ' m going to the mall for wrapping paper .
what do you do all day , <person> honey ? cause it sure isn ' t keeping house . this place is an eyesore . i ' m mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this ? <continued_utterance> i mean it ' s not like you ' re at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men ' s wives . <continued_utterance> the last time i saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party . god , <person> , you used to be hot !
i mean , he ' s probably , you know , upset about the i . r . s . taking the house and all our stuff .

that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . <person> has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this . well that ' s just more than the man deserves .
i think we should say some words over the grave .
you need not kill a man to destroy him .
no , you need only take away what is most precious to him .
before we start taking calls , the huge surge in ratings over the last few days , how do you hope to sustain that audience now that <person> appears to have reconciled himself , returned to `` normal '' ?
ratings have never been our primary goal . i
oh , <person> . i hate this guy .
we should have just ignored him .
<person> ' t you ?

i ' d sooner wait outside .
creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts .
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones . <continued_utterance> it ' s a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others . the question is , which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control ?
well , jeez , you ' re reading his biography , aren ' t you ?
oh , right . <person> , that ' s true . he used to rub ail kinds of things on it . <person> . ground lamb .

but <person> wiped your memory ! ! !
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded `` heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .
my legacy .

you were an innocent child .

i ' ll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning , wanting to know what ' s going on , i ' m going to lie to them !
your men ! all my life `` your men '' have been able to count on you ? why is it that you ' ve never been there for me ? <continued_utterance> and what if you ' re wrong ? what if one day , the sun didn ' t rise in the east and birds didn ' t fly south in winter and for once in your life your compass was off ? huh ? <continued_utterance> would you be willing to wreck your men ' s future ? my future ? please . dad . think . be practical , for a change . i ' m asking you , i ' m fucking begging you .
no , i don ' t .
<person> surprise you , but i was quite the student back in the day . straight a ' s . every subject ' cept for science . infuriated me how they tried to explain away the lord ' s creations . our teacher , mr . <person> , once said . in the future , humans won ' t be born with a pinky finger ' cause of evolution . of all the . i shouted , `` no ! we are created in the lord ' s image . not some nonsensical theory by <person> . `` sheryl stares at <person> , terrified would be an understatement . <continued_utterance> i suppose mr . <person> and mr . <person> can stand up and cheer , because you , little lady . you ' re about to evolve .

who says that i ' m protecting anyone ?
that triple the amount of stuff is going through .
right . but , that ' s not the biggest problem . one of our intel officers picked up information from dea that traffickers have come up with a process , a chemical process , to turn coke into something else . it doesn ' t smell like coke . it doesn ' t look like coke . and what ' s worse , it doesn ' t react to field test . it could be anything . maybe it ' s already happening . i mean , how would we know ?

you don ' t think <person> could ' ve put it there ?
i think that was yesterday .

i heard his voice as clear as day . i better get back . maybe something is wrong .
i trust . i absolutely trust . i ' ll go buy my ticket . <person> now !
i ' ll call you at four .
<person> ?

oh . <person> . well . just a couple things . one -- there ' s only two kinds of beer available -- <person> and <person> . <person> ' s better . and two -- if you see <person> hanging around the hotel bar -- hot , hot , hot -- but don ' t touch . she belongs to tacho , and if anybody gets caught with her then el presidente has promised to personally cut off the guy ' s .
<person> ?
i have nothing to say to you . get out of my house !
you speak english . <person> . now listen
the course of love is full of frightful turns . but , no matter how you feel , no matter how hopelessly afraid . never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in france . <person> that your starting point , and everything else will fall . into place .
the bravest man in france .
a little <person> , little <person> , little <person> , little this , little that . and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick i ever met .
the good doctor herself .
excuse me ?
forget it . we don ' t talk about anything personal . we made a rule about that . i don ' t know his name , what he does or exactly where he lives , so it will be really easy to stop seeing him , because i ' m not .
<person> is coming to pick me up .
have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling .
i think they are too serious , these american fishermen . in honduras , we are not so concerned with the method . reggie orders martinis for the three of them .
so , its back to the islands .
who would do that ?
<person> .
when word gets out that <person> was a cop , all hell will break lose . you ' ve got <number> hours . that ' s all i can give you . <number> hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department . <continued_utterance> tell you what . why don ' t you and that blonde what ' s-her-name come over for dinner sunday . how ' bout that .
what ' s-her-name moved to buffalo .
so , it was your first time .

the joy of rent control . six room for $ <number> a month .
we know . you ' ve told us a million times . i can ' t believe you ' re bringing it up at a time like this . it ' s like bragging because you ' re tall . <person> never brags about her rent and she pays even less than you .
<person> for instants .
you don ' t like <person> ? since when ?
but couldn ' t we find a way to --
<person> has forbidden your return . <continued_utterance> this is goodbye , brother . i ' m so sorry .
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .
is that what you ' d like me to do ?
you know nothing . what you don ' t <person> would fill a book . <person> , i feel like it ' s when you ' re around i need it most . you ' re never yourself , you never relax . never . everything ' s so stiff and dead . you always have to keep a rein on everything , ever yourself . oh , you smile sometimes , i ' ve even seen you laugh . but there ' s no light in your smile for me , <person> , nothing to keep me warm . and i get cold , <person> . i get so cold . what ' s between you and that <person> woman ?
all right , look . i can make it right , i can make this up to you , <person> . i can , i swear .
abortion ? no . that we won ' t do .
it ' ll work . <person> ' t no sin to abort a demon .
he turned that monster into stone !
did you give that acorn its power ?
stay with us , then , <person> . we all love you . we don ' t want you to go .
oh , that ' s very kind of you -- but this could never be like <person> . <person> must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now . oh , <person> , what am i going to do ?
you better hurry . you ' re going to be late for school .
really lame .
i can ' t come back ! i don ' t know how it works !
oh --
in the service you do , but we ' re not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we ' re doing , that doesn ' t particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
we been down this road . i told you how it is . unless you feel like there ' s something you want to do about it .
<person> <number> seconds , a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure . has an lcd readout , and it ' s cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor .
i just want to let you know mr . <person> i read all about you at nyu business , and i think you ' re an incredible genius and i ' ve always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you .
as much as possible .
you ' re sure ?
this isn ' t some <number> ' s porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .
oh . well . maybe not yet .
what police and reporters ?
someone died .
but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true .
consider me your fairy godfather , except without the fairy part . no more mealy apples and bruised bananas , ever , for the rest of your lives .
i didn ' t lie to you --
you did too --
there ' s a very weird reality- bleed-through effect happening here . i ' m not sure i get it .
what ' s in that needle ?
it ' s your dime , <person> .
and stop callin ' me <person> !
they could but they never will . it ' s too much work . they ' ll probably move him into <person> . hand me one of their brochures ?
but he has <person> now . she can handle it .
<person> doesn ' t get home until at least two in the morning .
i hope you know what you ' re doing . you speak to some guy at the frozen food section for five minutes , you could jeopardize your whole marriage .
yes , i ' m your tech support . we first met <number> years ago .
oh shit . you sold me the lucid dream . <continued_utterance> well , what the hell happened ?
you know what kind of woman <person> is , jake . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior . what ' s she to you , jake ; a woman who wants you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
two-hundred dollars ?
nevermind . the point is we must elope .
i don ' t know , <person> . i do love you , but i don ' t want to spend the rest of our lives on the run .
a teacher ' s .
oh my god .
what investigation ? <person> ' s murder ? <person> ' s disappearance ? what are you investigating ?
you ' re on one month ' s unpaid leave as of this moment .
but the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video , which is even more stunning than the <person> video . let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven ' t seen it , and i don ' t know anyone who hasn ' t , but <person> riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle , saving lives in the process , and then walked away without claiming a medal . he ripped the door off a tank !
<person> riordan is a genuine war hero , i ' m not taking anything away from the guy . he ' s a very , very tough guy , <person> , but the tank don ' t hit back . we ' ve seen youtube sensations fail on the big stage before .
and after that ? august has all our money . where will i go ?
<person> , i ' m not leaving you . we ' ll find a way together . i won ' t let you go back to him . i promise . <continued_utterance> . i ' ll call my dean at cornell . if i can take my finals again , get my degree , i can get my license .
it ' s not puppy love , <person> .
<person> to hear that . i thought the kid had staying power .
<person> , do you want me to call the cops ?
it ' s okay . it ' s okay . <continued_utterance> i ' ll see you later . sometime . i still want to buy you that drink .
why is that ?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance . she .
i never figured you for a pimp .
have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
great heavens , man , don ' t you know we ' ve been at war with germany since nineteen fourteen ? i thought perhaps you had seen action in france . or maybe . perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better . <person> ' t you come in ?
no . no , thank you .
you know him ?
he ' s my brother .
nothing . i ' m not going to be around for a while . i ' ll call you when i can .
<person> , what the fuck ?
his problem is that he ' s like totally sheltered because you treat him like he ' s three , instead of eight , so that ' s how he behaves .
oh yeah ? and how do you think he should behave ?
two-hundred .
what ?
i don ' t know your real name .
maybe i don ' t want you to .
easier than that , buddy . i ' ll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend <person> continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing . pretty soon everyone ' s involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
including rape , pillage , murder .
<person> ' s son . <continued_utterance> why ? you were knee-deep in jotun blood . why would you take me ?
you were an innocent child .
he says it ' s a box .
<person> , you ' re funny .
i ' m not from new york , actually . but i ' m very , very far from home .
<person> , you can ' t come in here .
this is a moment . you look great .
now ? !
all right - you ' ll be sorry .
go on , hurry up ! <person> up , i tell you !
but this is an emergency !
no ! no way ! you know what a pain that woman is -- she ' ll be on the next plane here to move in with us .
you do ? you finally think so too ? !
would you excuse us , dear ?
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping <person> , or could be in little pieces on <person> beach . any idea what <person> ' s going to do next ?
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we can ' t be sure .
i don ' t know . but i will find him .
after the kidnapping . i was afraid to go outside , to be alone , to be in a crowd , to do anything at all , until i realized . there ' s no point in living if you can ' t . feel alive . she looks out at the fading sun . <continued_utterance> i can ' t huddle in the shadows . i can ' t let fear run my life . i won ' t . <continued_utterance> the way i acted , in the snow . you must think i ' m a coward .
' <person> loaded ' i think is the term .
do take good care of her .
dr . <person> ' s not in .
i had an appointment at his office , i think i must have got it wrong . we had a meeting .
oh , yeah , a coke . you buying ?
no , <person> ' s buying . <person> ? coke ?
that ' s terrible . did he go quietly ?
no . he said you were his accomplice and now the ukiah police are looking for you !
he does . it comes out of his estate and he can afford it . trust me .
i don ' t get it . you ' ve never done it before .
you ' re telling me you believe the guy ?
all i ' m saying is , we let <person> push us too hard , we ' re going to wind up looking stupid .
bang-bang .
<person> dollar .
how .
<person> . he ' s been aimin ' that <person> through knotholes for years . i saw these , i knew he ' d finally struck gold . i can ' t decide which came out better , that little straw kelly ' s got up her nose , or that vibrator you ' ve got up her ass . what do you think , mr . <person> ?
thank you .
by the way , <person> went to sleep in his room tonight .
<person> . i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend . think that might be possible ?
i don ' t know . i ' m sort of at a critical . . . juncture .
like you , sweetheart . you and your daddy got the same mouth , eyes , ears , and nose . only difference is your color hair is like mine .
my daddy aint never killed nobody , has he , mama ?
oh , for <person> ' s sake .
you are .
i ' m not suggestin ' that ! i ' m not goin ' back . no matter what happens . so don ' t worry about me . <person> speeds up . <continued_utterance> can i ask you kind of a weird question ?
yeah .
<person> ?
it ' s <person> . i forgot <person> . <continued_utterance> my fish .
no , not quite . we didn ' t give you this . you ' re creating it yourself -- remember the option we offered you ? intelligence agent ? something inside you liked that idea , fastened on it . what you ' re experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating .
what is this shit you ' re giving me ?
my god , you ' re afraid of these people .
<person> ? what you ' re talking about ?
at least they work . would you rather have no hands at all ?
sometimes .
<person> , i ' m not leaving you . we ' ll find a way together . i won ' t let you go back to him . i promise . <continued_utterance> . i ' ll call my dean at cornell . if i can take my finals again , get my degree , i can get my license .
oh <person> , that would be wonderful . you know , i bet ringling would take us both then - they ' d be getting a vet and a star attraction - that ' s a sweet deal for them . although i won ' t be a star but i don ' t care . i ' ll take no billing at all . we ' d be safe from august if we were with ringling .
it ' s getting redder . <continued_utterance> bond . q switches the screen off , clears his throat .
could be a premature form of the millennium bug .
<person> , well , i ' ve been around the bend a bit .
one of those days you feel like you been runnin ' in circles and you ain ' t no closer to where you tryin ' to get than when you started ?
if it isn ' t straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .
these are real , live women ?
when they call , we must go below .
do the <person> live beneath the earth ? why must you obey their command ?
<person> is shocked . he thought he had a free pass into the second round , but instead he ' s going home . he dominated the fight the entire way , but fell prey to a very technical finish .
<person> technical finish , but come on , that ' s a fluke .
the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head . <continued_utterance> there are probably only four or five individuals in the world who can claim more knowledge of comics than myself . i ' ve spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read . i have studied the form intimately . i have seen the patterns in them . the references to social and cultural events and the atmosphere that surrounded them . i ' ve come to believe that comics are our last link to the ancient way of passing on history . <continued_utterance> the egyptians drew pictures on walls about battles , and events . countries all around the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms . i believe that comics , just at their core now . have a truth . they are depicting what someone , somewhere felt or experienced . then of course that core got chewed up in the commercial machine and gets jazzed up , made titillating - cartooned for the sale rack . <continued_utterance> this city has had its share of disasters . <person> publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as i waited and watched the news over the years . and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed . and just like that , an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality .
what was your idea <person> ? beat . elijah if there is someone like me in the world , and i ' m at one end of the spectrum . <person> ' t there be someone the opposite of me , at the other end ? a person who can ' t be hurt like the rest of us . a kind of person they were talking about in those stories . <person> points at the framed comic sketches . elijah a person they believed was put here to protect the rest of us . <person> us .
you ain ' t tying me up .
then i ' ll have to kill you .
it ' s fine .
you look a little old for a student .
a plague ?
the plague to end all plagues , <person> . a silent weapon for a quiet war . the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . they ' ve been working on this for fifty years . while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned <person> .
<person> ' t get out of the car .
stop me .
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?
indeed it is . during the day , visitors prefer to be outside , au naturel . as it were .
no . he checked out okay -- <person> slaps her again .
that is for interrupting . and that is for being wrong . we do not tolerate mistakes .
stop it .
well , the bride is sure snotty this morning .
of course .
i ' m gon na go with the favorite in this one -- fordnee lane .
it ' s for <person> .
nice . drop it in , it ' s on me . go ahead . <continued_utterance> how ' s he doing ?
yeah ?
i want you to tell me who changed the colors on my computer screen .
mom , that ' s a terrible thing to ask .
how do you like my latest ?
in college . a car accident .
was it serious ?
it was disgusting ?
yes . i looked like an ugly nun .
what would you have done ?
i would not have exiled him to a world of mortals , stripped of his powers , to suffer alone . i would not have had the heart for such cruelty !
what in the hell is that up there ?
where ? !
do you think you could . i mean , i could help pay for gas . thelma knows <person> isn ' t going to like this .
<person> . well , see , it ' s not really up to me . it ' s not my car . <person> , we ' ll have to ask my friend , but she ' ll probably say no . she ' s a little uptight .
listen you motherfucker , you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon .
you can ' t visit me here . i want my lawyer .
<person> your smart mouth . this means the end of child support .
which means .
like what ?
he gets to be the hero .
what is it ?
come closer . <continued_utterance> i love you .
<person> .

my eyes are brown .

i didn ' t .
uh huh . well , if anyone ever hears from her ever again , will you let me know ?
how ' s that different from the regular <person> ?
instead of the north pole , he lives in spain . and instead of elves he ' s got an enforcer named <person> . basically he ' s like your santa , only scarier .
hey ! <person> ! blow the man down .
a pretty young maiden she happened my way .
hell , i ' ve had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . <person> ' t much you can do when you feel like that ' cept tough it out .

so what ?
the owl is a messenger . when one shows itself to a sioux . it means someone ' s gon na die . the owl told him about <person> .
what . surprise ?
that ' s one thing i ' ll never tell you .
we know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . i ' m offering you the chance to call this off .
mr . so- my employer has made up his mind . he does not change it .
uh-huh . you mind if we take a moment to verify his identity ?
certainly . <continued_utterance> you can understand how a man could go off like that . i mean , a big , faceless organization like yours , coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property . <continued_utterance> . is how he described it .
<person> ' t you even miss me ? <person> ' t i mean anything to you ?
nothing . <continued_utterance> what about <person> ? or is this just another one of your stunts ?
the code name of your contact will be <person> . your code name will be --

<person> ! oh , <person> !
<person> ? please excuse me , ladies . i ' ll be right back . <continued_utterance> what is it , <person> ? <person> , where are you ?

<person> , writings on the wall here . <person> ' s right . with a reward on the table , do you think <person> and <person> will be the only two coming ? gon na have lots people looking for these two . we ' re gon na have to make it so no one can ever find them .
<person> , you were right . all the naked girls in the world mean nothing . it ' s the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love .
<person> . five years from now .

you got a brew ?
and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight .

<person> , it ' s <person> <continued_utterance> nope , haven ' t walked the plank yet . there was this guy back in college who was bothering me . got kind of ugly -- a restraining order , the whole bit . <person> , when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution .

<person> , i ' d like to speak to dr . <person> . this is his babysitter .
<person> on a minute . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
you must think i ' m blind and stupid . i ' ve already gotten the birds and bees from <person>by . the president doesn ' t have to double-barrel me .
<person> to me , goddamn it . we ' re talking about a possible nuclear war . you dropped the ball on bay of pigs --
<person> , i ' ll make my own decisions ! i got along very well in the army without you !
it took <number> , <number> men to take my place !

<person> . i have a speech to make . <continued_utterance> i like you people , but you are sentimental shits . you fall in love with the poets , the poets fall in love with the marxists , the marxists fall in love with themselves . the country is destroyed with rhetoric , and in the end we are stuck with tyrants .
you don ' t know anything about him .
oh , but you ' re wrong , sir , i know everything !

yes , exactly !
<person> ' s .

<person> ' t you always say gambling ' s an honest trade ?
i said poker ' s an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .
you know those little dogs you see people with ?
like a chihuahua ?
eighteen . well , i ' m gon na be eighteen in two years , but that don ' t mean you can ' t take me for a ride if you want .
no , i don ' t want to take you for a ride . what i want is for . hey , you don ' t think you can get $ <number> from your parents , could you ? from off camera we hear toby .
no .
what do you want ?
<person> ! where the hell have you been ?
never mind . i ' m coming in to take care of business . how hot am i ?
no , i was never fitted with a bioport . what do you care ?
you ' re hoping to get into the biz and you ' ve never played one of my games . you ' ve never played any game . that means you have no idea
just a formality .
that ' s it ? i mean , you don ' t want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .
we can not afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community !
if that were true , this would be one seriously constipated town . most guys in xenia have been looking at naked girls in `` heaven '' since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress .
i got kicked out . well , not exactly kicked out . i was asked to leave .
i guess there ' s probably a story behind that .
i don ' t know how . because he ' s different than we are . because he ' s a space guy . what do you want from me , anyway . go ask <person> .
you buy any of this , <person> ?
or perhaps it was the wisest choice i ' ve ever made . i will hear you .
i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers , lead you into his chambers , and let you slay him where he lies . i ' ll keep the throne , and you will have the casket .
well , i ' m glad . <person> my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know .

<person> ' t want any more trouble , <person> .
well you got trouble and it starts with you .
why now , <person> ?
' <person> , <person> . i don ' t want to lose you . and for some reason i get the feelin ' you ' re about to split . permanently .
he feels it is not . appropriate .
it sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters .
yeah , im here .
you upset with me ?
they send us because they want us to change , or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same .
let me tell you something about <person> ' s father , and your ' s too . how do you think you got here ? you think this is all free , that they owe you something ? you think they enjoy riding subways and commuter trains , driving buses or pulling lobster traps ? work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school ? look around at how the rest of the world lives <person> . we ' re the luckiest people alive , every one of us . they gave it up for you and <person> , and me too my friend . <continued_utterance> there are ground rules in families just like on this boat . if you and <person> don ' t like it , i ' m sorry . someday you ' ll understand that , and if you ' re lucky , you ' ll come home and find your best friend has been there all along waiting for you to forgive him for being a father . it ' ll be the way it used to be , when you were ten and your dad was a giant . <continued_utterance> does <person> know how you guys feel ?

what ' s the catch ?
there is no catch . i put together a tournament with an elite field and a half-million dollar purse , and i ' m tired of seeing all the money head out of town .
we just try to keep the general part quiet .
why ? begging your pardon , sir .
god , you have great legs .
<person> . snap out of it !
only on condition you don ' t sell right away , and me ' n <person> keep our jobs .
what in the world would i want with your stupid driving range ?
i ' ve never crippled anyone yet .
how many have you done ?
then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it ' s just a dream ?
i ' ve been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy . i ' m actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console . this is a last resort . when somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy , we send in someone after them . a specialist , like myself .
uh huh .
my husband the hero . <continued_utterance> i ' ll be right there , honey . just a minute . <continued_utterance> just a second . <continued_utterance> <person> birthday , <person> .
you will ?
sure , <person> . of course i will . you know that .
cant you read ?
back in a bit .
why not ?
she has a horrible personality , she ' s . nice to everyone all the time . it ' s exhausting . and her staff turnover is . non-existent . they ' ve been there forever . until . recently , when they all found out they were going to lose their jobs .
i ' m asking you seriously , <person> , a stranger ?
i don ' t know , honey . i guess it would depend .
it ' s a prescription .
is it ?
have you got your gun on now ?
sure have , <person> .
she ' s not a psychic . just a very enlightened spirit .
thanks , but i ' m fine .
economic summit ends in tokyo -
boring -
bad timing .

i was in the area , and i thought you might like to have lunch .
they must ' ve just missed me .
that ' s coming right from the president , captain .
<person> . uh . . . sir ? you ' re going to have to sign for the aircraft .
do you know the reason why i try to recruit guys like you ? there ' s no risk . <continued_utterance> there ' s nobody back home who ' s gon na ask questions if you just . disappear for a while .
now i ' m the one who ' s nauseous . so what ' s the deal ? what do you need me for ?
he takes his work seriously .
he takes himself seriously .
do you know the song that goes ' <person> ' s a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp ' ?
no , i don ' t . we must listen to different music . personally i ' m very fond of opera .
<person> , i know . i was beginning to think we ' d never meet . this is fortuitous . that means lucky .
i know what it means .

deal .
senor , give him the bag .
that ' s all right . he doesn ' t want to give me the bag .
just a stranger who once knew your father .
i see . have you been at the front , sir ?
this is so weird . it ' s happening , but it ' s not . it ' s like a tv show , and we ' re part of it .
at-at-at-at-at .
i just mean . . .
forget i asked . i don ' t want to pressure you , <person> . but . . i get pressure . know what i mean ? <continued_utterance> ah . . well now . what do you suppose that would be ?
forty miles .
come off it -- it ' s not that far .
i think you ' ve got some issues to deal with . really , when we get out of here i ' m pretty sure it ' s shrink time for you .
just listen to me ! i ' ve been doing some reading . in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks . it became part of the ottoman empire . when the turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards . they buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle boxes . i read about this , man . i read about it .
the swamp , most likely . <person> ' s a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he ' s made a mistake .
her grandmother said she ' d been threatening to run away . and i found the car at the miami bus terminal .
put that gun down , you buck-toothed fool .

<person> . it ' s beautiful !

i ' m afraid so , pal . she ' s staying so you can finish the season . that ' s pretty nice of her . <continued_utterance> i told her you ' d go see her today , <person> .
where ?
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium ?
i was hoping you could tell me .
they must ' ve just missed me .
they said you had to run out .
do you always hold hands with reporters ?
this is my mother and father . they were very special to me . <person> sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave . i think people should know that .
give it to me !
gawd . you ' re . beautiful .
oh my poor baby . how did you get so screwed up ?
oh , mom .
<person> ' t you prefer your order in your room , sir ?

no .
<person> ! <person> of a bitch ! <person> !
how are things goin ' out there ?
weird . got some kind of snowball effect goin ' here or somethin ' .
<person> ? <person> ' t inspire a lot of confidence .
oh , on the contrary , the <person> is considered a very good omen . it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on . it ' s very bad luck if you kill one . and dolphins too .
i don ' t know . i . maybe this is . last year i sort of thought you were possibly interested in that . idea . but i was the one who , you know , wasn ' t `` ready '' at that point -- so that ' s why i thought things kind of slowed down with us .
<person> ' t make me feel bad for you .
who are you talking about ?
wild kids we used to know .
he was a <continued_utterance> ask you what ? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next ?
<person> ' t you want to know . ? i bet it ' s burning a hole in your brain just now ?
no , no , it ' s <person> ' s , i mean it ' s not <person> ' s , it ' s . someone loaned it to us , i mean someone .
and what ' s the little girl ' s name ?
you peeked , didn ' t you ?
i peeked . <continued_utterance> it really had the makings , <person> . there was a lot to admire . i ' ve . never read anything quite like it .
no , woody , for the first time i am thinking clearly . you were right all along . i ' m not a space ranger . i ' m just a toy . a stupid little insignificant toy .
<person> , hey -- wait a minute . being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger .
you ' re amazing .
i know .
stop that , honey .
what ?
you ' re a dead man , macready -- or a dead whatever the hell you are ! <continued_utterance> we found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn .

there . in the study . <person> ' t you see -- she looks again -- nothing . <continued_utterance> wow . i ' m losing it .
no , you ' re not . but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly .
you know , you should swab that with alcohol . i might get an infection .
i ' ll return when this has taken effect . then we ' ll talk .
do you know how many times i ' ve had someone die on me ? how many children ?
i thought . i wasn ' t thinking . what do you want me to do ?
see you in class .
<person> , right ?
<person> , that ' s more or less what the others said , too . out getting coffee . supposed to meet him here . picking up my grandma . ted turns and glares at him . dr . lalonde i ' m just saying . they sure made you look dumb . <person> . a couple big cracks of the neck .
<person> , do you remember <person> ?

no baby . we ' ll all be right in .
<person> , i don ' t believe this !

got any paved roads ?
no we don ' t .
halt !
you gon na make me ? you and what army ?
i understand . yes . the company draws many eccentric people into its fold . you can hide in one of the guest chalets . as long as you like . i will make sure you get fresh towels .

really ?
yeah . i ' ve got the baby-sitter . but . thanks for a lovely evening .
looks like weather .
yep . <continued_utterance> do me a favor and tell <person> once she ' s dogged down i want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we ' ll spend the next week sorting underwear . <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , and <person> will stand the watch . everyone else hit the racks .
no , he took <person> to his mother ' s , she couldn ' t wait to see her . he ' s gon na try to unload her on her till <person> gets back . i made her four bott .
you ' re kidding ! that son-of-a- bitch !

this is mr . <person> in subscriptions ?
how come you ' re calling me from . ?
what are you gon na have ?
a steak .
<person> has invited <person> and me to see the work he ' s been doing .
<person> ! playing in a pool all day long ? squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers ? i consider this your fault , <person> !
what kind of mine ?
i don ' t know , and i wasn ' t about to mess with it .
<person> is dead . <continued_utterance> i can smell it .
i don ' t know .
hey , pal , you don ' t start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens .
excuse me . did you , or did you not , have a gun to his head ?
<person> , i ' ll get you money . i will , i ' ll get you money . i ' ll . i ' ll work for it ! i ' ll work for it .
i ' m sorry .
sure .
<person> , i ' m not . remember how i was talking i wanted to blow away all those iraqis ? that ' s all it was was talk . i was scared out of my mind to go to war . i still haven ' t gotten over stepping on that land mine .
they look nice .
you haven ' t even looked at them once .
oh , i forgot .
she ' ll be down here shortly .
because i ' m at the edge of my capabilities , <person> .
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front .
so do we .
<person> , well , i thought i ' d start by laying all the cards on the table , so maybe you can understand why i ' m hesitating in turning <person> over to <person> .
what ?
look ! <person> !
what happened to your face ?
<person> wanted to make sure i understood something he was saying .
shorthand . really ?
we ' re heading into a difficult situation .
i have to answer him .
so you can give us away ?
and she was a little more than pissed about it .
have you been harboring this shit all along ? i never talked to her .
that ' s the call that i ' m waiting for .
what does it mean ?
we let him stay . i don ' t know , do we even have a choice ?
i guess we don ' t .
it ' s not a real bear . it ' s a `` representation '' of a bear . you know , a `` picture . ``
that ' s stupid .
is that any way to say hello ?
i thought your specialty was good-bye .
oh yeah ? i left the country because of him . . and i came back because of him . and now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse ' s ass on a midnight tour of managua . what are we doing here ?
<person> is dead . <person> . <person> isn ' t quite sure he understood .
you don ' t understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
<person> ' t surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
and they want to blame us ?
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and <person> hadn ' t taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
we don ' t have an opinion on you .
maybe it ' s because i ' m getting an apartment nicer than anything you ' ll ever see in your life ? <continued_utterance> i can ' t believe the old man kept his promise .
their fate is sealed . but for my faith and devotion , the self-same <person> has given unto me the whole of this land , from the jordan to the negev , from the river of egypt to the great euphrates . this did he grant to me and my seed .
this is all your land ?
you won ' t need it tonight . everything ' s provided for .
<person> ! is that who i think it is ?
i really did think i was still in reality . at least , until now . beam me up , <person> !
<person> , get me out of here !
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the nelson ' s . <person> , right . how midwest . i like that .
<person> . i take it back .
no , say ' you ' re not a sissy . '
yeah . still moldable , too .
everyone likes a good kid .
there is always a way ! but you are such a . a glotzkopp you can not see ! you ' d rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !
land ! are you crazy ? i ' m no amishman and i ' m no farmer ! i ' m a cop . that ' s what i know and that ' s what i do !
the fact is . we ' d like you to give <person> another chance .
<person> ' t do it .
what kind of ideas ?
well . for one thing . i think it ' s despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ``
what do you think ?
<person> ' s dropping . the first blow ' ll come from the south . <person> get interesting .
<person> step around the office . <person> step around the office ! <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> : hi fam ! he ' s a genius !
this will give you plenty to digest while i ' m on vacation .
<person> like <person> wasn ' t fast enough to outrun that load . what do you make of the damage ?
six rounds . <number> .
we ' ve come to arrest you . <person> your arms ! <continued_utterance> hold ! i don ' t want that !
oh , my god .
<person> , of course . i was worried when i didn ' t hear from you that night .
it ' s strange . i knew i was in a woman ' s thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins .
some fruit . <continued_utterance> no .
<person> ? <person> ? umm , mango ? kiwi ? peach ? she shakes her head coyly .
and what makes you so tough ?
maybe i ' ll tell you later .
have you tried <person> ? <person> ' s very nice this time of year .
i ' m surprised you aren ' t more cooperative , mr . <person> . a human has been murdered by a toon . <person> ' t you appreciate the magnitude of that ? my goal as judge of toontown , has been to rein in the insanity . to bring a semblance of law and order to a place where no civilized person has ever been able to step foot . the only way to do that is to make the toons respect the law . <continued_utterance> why , you filthy little vagrant , you ' ve soiled my robe !
why ?
why what ?
you ' re gon na love <person> . trust me . it ' s crazy . this morning , i almost got a handie behind that pita stand .
well , i kind of have a girlfriend -- not a girlfriend , yet , but a girl i like , so i shouldn ' t --
<person> .
you ' re surprised . certainly you ' ve been expecting some response to your indiscretion . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite sure whatever you told <person> , you have your good reason . it ' s a weakness in men our age ; the urge to confess . i forgive you that .
hey , your . what the hell happened to you ?
nothing .
who ' s car did you steal ?
a teacher ' s .
really ? have you seen our show ? <continued_utterance> what was your favorite act ?
the uh . the one with the black and white horses . and the girl in pink .
the problem is i don ' t happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .
whacking ?
you came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england .
my god .
you have acquaintances -- business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
what are you fucking talking about ?
i don ' t understand .
<person> ' s in town . he just became an american citizen . something big ' s about to go down . i want to know where he goes and who he sees . i want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture .
money . its name is money .
<person> selected it .
something came over me , i just had nail him , no matter what the risk . it was pretty hairy . i thought he had me , a couple of times . but i really can ' t take credit . . .
you can ' t ?
<person> , do you remember a carswell fensterwald ?
my god , <person> , look at this .
but the white dot in the middle ; that ' s got to mean something .
i hope it means something , otherwise .
i don ' t have a wife . well , i do - but not a real wife . <person> . look . someone else sent that note . someone who --
what are you here for ? !
when did this fucking package fucking arrive , <person> ?
i don ' t know . oh yeah , sunday -- mrs . <person> brought it up .
two hundred dollars ?
that ' s right . god knows how many homes we could sell by people passing this house . it ' s perfectly placed for that . <person> , this is how confident i feel that this house will drum up business for me .
<person> .
what about you , i hear you guys are handling the fairchild foods merger and it may not be going through . any surprises i haven ' t read about in the wall street journal ?
that ' s going to be tough . you know how these guys are about their chains of command .
any problems , you remind them those chains of commands end at one place . me .
that she thought we were married .
you are relentless .
<person> ' t leave me ! everything is going round and round !
<person> ' s leaving you ! <person> , get me a cold towel !
the president has instructed me to pass along an order to you . you are not to get shot down .
uh . we ' ll do our best , sir .
yes .
do you work ?
maybe we ought to . you know , bury him .
you want to say some words ? <continued_utterance> go to hell . how are those words ?
<person> , meet us out front when you ' re through . if they try to take anything away from you like <person> up there , just make a list and we ' ll have ' em send it down to the boat .
whatever .
lose them ? in this ?
<person> on !
i ' m better than that .
you ' re also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that ' ll never see a screen , regardless if it ' s leading lady gets `kidnapped ' or not .
<person> . <person> your dinner .
there are five basic emotions in life . tell me . what emotion gripped . him . before he entered that cell ? was it <person> ? <continued_utterance> hate ? shame ? <continued_utterance> revenge . <continued_utterance> <person> ? <continued_utterance> i ' m completely on the wrong track , aren ' t i ?
<person> ' . <person> ' came in today at all .
<person>g under peaches ? <person> again under peaches .
yes . so that makes it the game- life version of our own company . <person> is equivalent to <person> in the real world .
that ' s probably fair to say .
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex . i think you ' re gon na need one tonight .
<person> ' t get ahead of yourself . you ' ll probably need it before i will .
whats gon na happen when he sees me drivin the car tomorrow ?
maybe hell get a little nervous , but who gives a shit ? <continued_utterance> i knew we could be friends again .
i can ' t help myself . <person> pats him . frank what about you ? is there someone else ?
oh , somewhere out there , i ' m sure . somewhere -- in cyberspace .
how do you open that panel ?
no one opens it . only the <person> .
yes .
<person> please .
oh , yeah ? you ' ll be callin ' soon and maybe i ' m not gon na be there .
oh , come on , sweetie , give me one of your smiles .

get your gear on .
<person> bought this beautiful antique <person> .
please . that ' s all i need .
what ? ! what ' d i do ?
<person> , i got ta feelin ' about somethin ' and i just wan na ask your opinion . do you think thelma <person> would have committed armed robbery if you hadn ' t taken all their money ? <continued_utterance> <person> got your tongue ?
well but -- are you gon na come back to say good-bye ?
no -- i ' m just gon na take off . i ' ll see you later .
oh shit !
yeah . yeah . what about the hor . ?
i mean i took him to play pool ! it was a little clandestine thing we did for fun ! it wasn ' t like a big secret , i mean who cares ? i was actually trying to be nice to him . but he ' s so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin ' squeal on me and i have to listen to your fuckin ' shit all day when i didn ' t even fuckin ' do anything !
first of all , he didn ' t tell me anything : <person> did . ok ? second of all , i don ' t really give a shit if you took him to play pool : i was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain . but no , i don ' t want you telling him not to squeal , because i don ' t want him put in that position !
who else could it have been ? it was probably around <number> --
i mean , it ' s not like he was something normal , like a socialist or an anarchist or something --
it takes time to find the proper collection .
how much will you give me in cash ? today . <continued_utterance> you must be joking . that ' s a fraction of their value .
what for ?
for your health .
you ' re skill .
<person> . i got to be on the sidelines during the game . you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at-
<person> . i ' m in some trouble . i need an attorney and you ' re the only one i know . so i figured i ' d start here .
well , i ' m glad you did . and i ' m sorry . why don ' t you tell me about it .
that ' s <person> ' s way !
well in the city of philadelphia , <person> needs a little help !
<person> , this is difficult , but we ' ve all had our moments . i tried --
stop . you experimented in college .
i have only one concern . <continued_utterance> you do like girls , don ' t you ?
of course i like girls .
<person> !
wrong , and you get to wax my car .
but <person> , i can ' t find him !
well , honey , just grab some other toy ! now c ' mon !
<person> ! . i ' m gon na ask ya a few more questions now . ya think you ' ll be able to answer ' em ?
. yes .
what ?
can you swim ?
no one will be laughing at you now , ted . you can take that to the bank .
it ' s really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
i don ' t know what this crazy bitch is on . you should just cut her loose , so we can get down to business .
oh yeah ? oh yeah ? then where did i get this ?
' <person> ' m just like dynamite . and when i go off , somebody gets hurt .
<person> . i was making time with your girl . now i ' m scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?
<person> !
give me the valium .
<person> !
. don ' t put me in the river .
just say it , dad .
i know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?
<person> .
<person> ! come sta , ragazzo ?
yes .
get in . i ' ll drop you .
you musta seen him . he hangs out with <person> , cheese . you know , that group .
i don ' t know the guy .
<person> , i appreciate , you know , the concern and all , but like he said , i can take care of myself .
i just brought you something to eat . <continued_utterance> i feel like i got you into this .
if we find <person> , <person> won ' t be far behind .
think he ' s keeping track of his creation ?
you ' ve got this wrong . you ' re not under arrest , you ' ve been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .
is that a fact ?
frankly , <person> , i can ' t see giving much more . if you have any suggestions i ' ll be glad to listen .
there came into egypt a pharaoh who did not know .
<person> , listen pal , this is not the time to long that stock , you know what i mean ?
no . what does that mean ?
you know damn well what we both make of it .
no chance it could have been some new kind of test craft ?
i think there ' s a lot of truth in that . i ' m gon na pursue some options . i want to join that <person> thing .
that ' s a good one .
it ' s within the realm . he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning .
i think i might have .
i don ' t know . warm stuff , i guess . it ' s the mountains . i guess it gets cold at night . i ' m just gon na bring everything .
<person> . i will , too .
you spineless paper tiger - <continued_utterance> where is she , <person> ? ! ? or did you kill her like paris ?
we all go down together ! ! !
<person> ?
<person> , two l ' s .
i ' m sorry the court finds my argument repetitious .
mr . <person> , may i offer a piece of advice ? the next time you argue this point before this court , regardless of my whereabouts , i recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm .
right . she had a friend with her . the friend took off .
was there an argument ?
why does he belong with us ?
because we deserve that money , <person> . not some lawyer . you ' re a big boy . you can understand that .
the second letter is an accident ?
no . the letter is an intentional , but it ' s having an effect far greater than its authors intended . what if our jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something ? maybe a bone <person> is throwing to the hard line , not really caring if we reject it or not ? and then these accidents have happened .
let me put it to you this way . whether i ' m here . or whether i ' m not . i ' m leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
where did you plant the c- <number> ? ! <continued_utterance> you can ' t die until you tell me where the c- <number> is . where is it ? !
well . i could use a beer .
i could use a tranquilizer .
i ' m not worried ?
you ' re getting it done .
a trailer was here . what the hell do you think ?
can you tell me who ' s trailer it was .
here we go again . like we ' re back at one eyed <person> .
oh , god . it sure is .
<person> . as in medicine man ? <continued_utterance> why does he wan na see me ?
good question . <person> sees anybody anymore . <person> ' t left this place in twenty years . did you bring some tobacco ? <continued_utterance> when you go see an elder , you always bring some tobacco as a gift .
to see your father ?
no . i won ' t be long .
i can ' t think of anyone i ' d rather lie here with . <continued_utterance> <person> maybe <person> . if <person> were here , what do you suppose he would do to me ?
make love to you i would think .
this is ridiculous .
you a coward ? you gon na lay up the way you did at the masters last year ?
why did you kill him ? it was the next bit i really .
no choice , boss . it was him or you .
<person> ! playing in a pool all day long ? squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers ? i consider this your fault , <person> !
i beg your pardon , <person> ?
who fights about that ?
some people . not us .
yes , <person> .
are you sure ?
she is . i knew she would be . she had to be .
she looks . i would say she has a little of the coloring of that <person> person .
chill out --
it ' s a funny fuckin ' joke and it ' s quick . why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
no , of course not . kind of makes you wonder though -- the guys who built it , did they just die the minute they finished , or did the gods give them a second to get out ?
i assume they finished it , then the gods descended .
sure you can , no problem . <person> , i got ta go now , i ' m gon na see if she ' ll share a cab with me . you take the shuttle , okay ?
but i got ta explain to you about .
<number> oakridge drive .
oh , yeah , i know where that is . all right . if the guy calls again , try to keep him on the line for at least a minute so we can trace the call .
are you humoring me ?
nope .
get his rifle back .
am i supposed to go clear to seattle just to get .
<person> .
<person> . <person> steps . <person> steps . <continued_utterance> you flying or driving ?
. not the pit .
always one step ahead of your dear old dad .
twice .
is that what you were trained to do ?
i mean , where are our real bodies ? are they all right ? are they hungry ? what if there ' s danger ?
kissing and caressing
prejudiced ? against what ?
earthmen .
forget it . i got vegetables coming out my ears . usually the varmints eat up half my crop , but lately i ain ' t so much as <continued_utterance> we playing cards tonight ?
i think i ' m gon na be sitting up with her .
his will .
now use it .
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they ' ve got a of nerve agent they ' re gon na unleash .
mandrakis . it ' s okay . everyone gets it wrong the first time . you ' re <person> ? come on in .
thank you .
what about <person> ' s money ?
well .
well , you know . figured i ' d buy a washing ticket , support the effort . that old jeep of mine ' s kind of a waste of time , don ' t you think ?
not at all . how about if <person> and i do it ? we ' re working as a team .
is that what you ' d like me to do ?
go home , <person> . it ' s late .
the fairy queen ? and the baby here ' s a princess ? and these two rodents are your guides ? <continued_utterance> yeah well . in the morning i think i ' ll be on my way .
<person> , i need your help .
i had no choice . i ' m a slave , remember ?
i was going to rescue you ! really !
that is why i ' m king . <continued_utterance> i , too , grieve the loss of our son . but there are some things that even i can not undo .
you can bring him back .
you know , you ' re absolutely right . would you mind sitting over there ?
what for ?
some folks take that natural stuff too far .
<person> ' s wife kept her afterbirth ' in the refrigerator . that ' s why i do not eat over there now .
it ' s trouble , that ' s what . not that i give a damn , but you ' re playing with dynamite with those two and you ' re gon na blow all of us up . <person> is the meanest sonofabitch i ' ve ever met .
i admit he has his moments of insanity but he ' s really a very generous , charming guy .
what ' re you talkin ' about ?
all the years i worked the cowtowns , i was only ever mixed up in one shooting . <person> one . a man got killed . <person> ' t my fault , <person> doin ' my job . i don ' t even know if it was my bullet that <person> him , but . i don ' t kno , it ' s sort of hard to explain . at first i just felt funny , you know , kind of clammy inside . but when it finally sunk in what i ' d <person>e . believe me , boy , you <person> ' t ever want to feel that way . not ever . <person> ' t even make a dent , did i ? you ' re both makin ' a big mistake .
you amped the neural connectors back up , didn ' t you ? you ' re the reason the convict died .
i couldn ' t just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . i ' m a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .
how much ! ?
hundred-fifty .
who are these orphans , anyway ?
they ' re <person> .
what ? ! ? why ?
i dunno . she just called and asked if i wanted to hang out tonight . i didn ' t want to ask why . i need to find someplace for us to get it on .
<person> out , hit , and move .
<person> . <person> . <person> . he ' s not your brother , right ? he ' s just a guy who ' s in the way . <continued_utterance> i ' m taking a little more time for the cheap shot ! do your job , <person> !
the connection is , it did a head number on him . he ' s petrified of cars . <person> ' t drive . i ' ve known him all my life , and he ' s never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle . he rides passenger and he rides horses , and that ' s it . the man that shot <person> down was behind the wheel of a moving car .
that ' s not solid .
please .
<person> . <person> .
<person> , i hate sounding so clinical all the time . all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well , but then i .
<person> . i know what you meant .
he can wait .
i can ' t , <person> . i ' ve got to run .
yes . it would be .
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .
who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i shouldn ' t just put you in a dumpster ?
i have money --
i wouldn ' t care if i drop dead if he learn something from it . <person> , you make me wish i was dead .
<person> , don ' t say things like that .
<person> ?
no , we ain ' t got no <person> . we got <person> .
i don ' t know . if he ' d ' ve asked me this time last year i would have probably said yes . but the minute he said it , i don ' t know , i felt like somebody was trying to strangle me .
well . bad sign .
well , good , that ' s settled .
not quite , darling . i want one more thing .
to find out if he knows anything . if you think he does , you got ta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped .
<person> , <person> , tapped the phone ? you think so ?
and you glad you married me ?
what ?
like a king . <continued_utterance> it ' s time .
you go ahead . <continued_utterance> i ' ll be along . go on .
who do we interface with on their side ?
what do you mean ?
you watch your language . this is a christian home . we ' re sending <person> to <person> cole des arts and literatures in <person> .
<person> ! but she ' ll be miserable without me . we ' re in love .

leave me be for a minute ? mama gets all insane and then i see you practicin your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp . how you figure im gon na feel ?
told you not to call your mama .
where ' s the other half ?
probably the next meal . <continued_utterance> where these tracks headed ?
if i don ' t answer , he ' ll know something ' s up .
you answer him , but you answer him wrong and you ' re going to be staring at your insides while you ' re dying . <continued_utterance> <person> !
your dad and i were raised with a certain work ethic , that ' s all .
we can ' t start living like we ' re the rockerfellers or something .
<person> in there , i ' ll think of something .
well ?
i thought all that <person> stuff was so charming . f-o-x .
i never lied about it --
i doubt it , darling . <continued_utterance> you want to keep him happy .
if he ' s happy . . . i ' m happy .
i , what are you talking about ? i talked to her this morning , and she said .
she told me .

the kuala lumpur ferry was <number> miles off-course that night . <person> blamed the auto-pilot ; i suspected he was drunk - until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem .
i don ' t think he died . i mean , do you ? i think he maybe fainted . <continued_utterance> that was <person> , head of publicity and marketing , at antenna hq . <continued_utterance> . on that very expensive pink- fone you threw away . <continued_utterance> he said that some bizarre fanatical group called the anti- existenzialists has put a price of <number> million dollars on your head , payable to anybody who kills you . it ' s been released to all the media now . everybody knows about it .
anti-existentialists ?
that a fact ?
i can see just fine . for example : you ' re a young man who thinks he ' s got someplace to be . a police radio crackles , <person> tensing .

i didn ' t say a thing to him . he just put his arm around me . told me i was pretty . i could be really pretty , he said .
what ' d he say ?
he wanted to know if a grady trip ? lived here and drove a dark maroon <number> ford <person> <number> with black interior .
he lived through that ?
says they were deserters , they were afraid to fight , don ' t believe in saddam anyway . they flew the gunship up here to hide out . when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them , so they shot first .
well , i didn ' t do so well either -- i blew it with <person> . i don ' t even know how .
who ' s <person> ?
<person> on .
what are you doing ? ! <person> -
well , you ' re probably bored . not being challenged . your application was very good , <person> , but we have many boys who want to go to <person> . not everybody is comfortable at a prep school .
i think i would be . my father and brother went to prep schools .
he did too . he nailed me . he knew exactly what i was up to . <person> is just like him .
but he didn ' t exactly answer , did he ?
-- don ' t `` man '' me , <person> . where ' s the key ? <continued_utterance> ray , use the federal master key .

sit . <continued_utterance> your father was a proud man . and he had a right to be . i never knew one as brave or as kind . he knew that his strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor . that is why he dedicated his life to his country and his king . that is why he gave his life , for both . <continued_utterance> i watched you this morning and saw someone i knew . you have your father ' s heart , his will to fight , his courage . but these gifts have no value unless they are given . <continued_utterance> it ' s time for you find your fortune with men as brave and as bold as you are . in paris . with the king ' s musketeers . you ' ll need this .

yeah . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m sorry we ' ve been stepping on each other ' s toes -- i -- i ' m not actually that bad a guy --
before .
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs .
do you think you ' re ready ?
it ' s not me i ' m worried about . you know <person> , the only reason we haven ' t slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left . you owe me , i want you , what else is there . but you , me , the world . . right here . make love to me . now . stop me if i ' m going too far .

maybe you ought to read him pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .
you ' re walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .
one minute you ' re defending the whole galaxy . . and suddenly you find yourself suckin ' down darjeeling with <person> and her little sisters . the headless dolls turn and wave .
i think you ' ve had enough tea for today . <person> ' s get you out of here , <person> .

oh .
it ' s probably just some weirdo . the city ' s full of them . believe it or not , we get reports like this every night . it ' s nothing to worry about .
oh .
i played the cards i was dealt , <person> . your problem is you ' re always trying to play someone <person> ' s . allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free : there is no happiness , <person> there is no normal life . there ' s only life , that ' s all . just life .

she ' s too powerful , <person>
a true magician , <person> , never surrenders . she is a sorceress -- i am a sorceress ! transform me now and i will destroy her ! <person> !
<person> ? outta what ?
outta my job , outta queens . <continued_utterance> it doesn ' t mean anything .
<person> ' t bother . i ' m taking a trip .
where , the mall ?
council approach . <continued_utterance> what ' s going on <person> ?
well judge , i think i ' d be a better candidate then the state in this case .
gold ! !
its branches are supposed to be made of gold , solid gold .
i ' m not . <person> down <person> ' s old stuff , and he ' s twice as big as me -- i ' m gon na stay home .
you ' re gon na shit and fall back in it -- that ' s all you ' re gon na do .
yes .
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .
i ' d feel better if i just knew where you were . it ' s <person> ' s <person> right ?
<person> .
how would i do that ? send him on a trip - like maybe to hawaii ?
<person> , why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game ?
yeah . fitful dreams .
<person> . you had a vision . you got sign from the old ones .
you had some problems with it .
i better read it . <person> workers tend to vote democratic . next .
i ' m not bad , i ' m just drawn that way .
i ' m not complainin ' . but give me credit . i ' m the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
i hear all you guys on wall street are millionaires , when you gon na make us rich ?
got ta open an account to win the lottery , <person> . give me <number> , <number> , you ' ll have a condo in florida next christmas .
wrong number .
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . <person> ' t you , <person> ?
<person> , that ' s it . i ' ve had enough of the waiting room now .
oh .
she asked about you , madmartigan .
well what did she say ?
i ' ve already dropped it on you twenty-three times .
<person> ' t worry about me . i can take it .
depends what number you write . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
happily .
so what did we just make ?
a similar triangle ?
i ' m not `` afraid '' --
no , really , it ' s all right . i just thought you might be curious why we can eat everything else that walks , crawls , swims , flies , or grows in the ground , but not that particular fruit . and i thought you might be the kind of man who ' s willing to take a chance and start thinking for himself , but i guess i was wrong .
why didn ' t you tell me what we were doing here ? <continued_utterance> we ' re running a cover-up and you didn ' t --
you ever put your hands on me again and you ' ll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades , <person> .
have you gone crazy ? you are not <person> . you aren ' t as good as <person> . they are moving the trial to a high security location . the press has gone berserk . the jury will be influenced . stay out of things . let us try to win the case .
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .
no , honey . this is official from the court . it ' s what <person> said . <continued_utterance> he gets paid for being <person> ' s guardian , <person> . and then he just put him in that place so he didn ' t have to worry about him . <continued_utterance> <person> belongs with us , <person> .
why ?
then what ? ! what , goddamnit , <person> ! where the fuck are you going ? are you just leaving for fucking ever ? what , did you fuckin ' murder somebody or what ? !
stop it ! stop it , <person> , or i ' ll leave right now . i ' m not kiddin ' !
<person> ' t walk behind me .
right .
i ' m getting a little hungry . i ' ve got a headache as it is . just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in .
why do i need a guy telling me what i should or shouldn ' t eat ?
<person> . someone stole my car . i parked it right there last night .
are you sure you parked it there ?
the number of women he ' s slept with .
the number of times he ' s seen the godfather .
nah . i ' m gon na head home . i got ta call the boys and break the news . i ' ll call you tomorrow .
coach ! hey , i know this isn ' t a great time . and it ' s too bad about <person> . but what about me ?
nope . i ' ve never robbed a bank .
what ?
and you didn ' t do anything about it ?
no . i didn ' t .
what do you mean , kiss it ?
i mean tap it . firm but very , very softly . and don ' t shoot until you know it ' s going in . ok ?
stupid .
why do you say that ?
what ?
you heard me . you already put a fucking nick in my piano .
where is <person> ?
<person> ' s fallen into the <person>sleep . my mother fears he may never awaken again .
you , an army brat ? i don ' t see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he ' d get his name cleared , but it didn ' t happen .
it ' s a message . he wants us to know he ' s back .
who ?
that hardly makes up for the imposition . now , for what i hope will be the very last time - pay attention , <number> . first , computer generated retrograde analysis map . body here , meteorolog- ical influences here , likely vector- ing of the ship ' s coordinates here .
do you have any idea of what any of that means ? in english ?
he ' s going to insert the plutonium . <continued_utterance> do you know what you ' re doing ?
like riding a bike .
oh come on , don ' t feel bad . you got played , so what ? you ' re new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?
why you dogging me up ?
how do you guarantee that ?
well it ' s the company motto : ' if you ain ' t happy we ' ll send you the extra minute . '
i remember the first time you walked into mrs . <person> ' s class in <number> nd grade . <person> gingham dress .
which you pulled , hard !
<person> .
we always went to rehobeth . year in and year out . <person> , i ' ve never been more bored in my life . i was always so jealous of my friends who spent summers at the jersey shore .
i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up .
you stay inside . i will see to them .
that on your ' <person> . ' to read all those books ? <continued_utterance> <person> . maybe i want to try being positive . <continued_utterance> maybe i miss doing that dumb play with you . <continued_utterance> maybe you inspire me .
that sounds like horseshit .
<person> ' t be afraid , dad . everything will be okay . you deserve to be loved .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ? is <person> there ?
the three unions . it ' s <number> % of <person> ' s operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ <number> an hour , that ' s the real hidden value g . g . , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ <number> - <number> an hour a run , this airline is gon na be the hottest thing since <person> .
what makes you think you can ?
it ' s all right . no one can hear . we ' ll never get another chance to say it all . <continued_utterance> nothing can ever happen with us , you know . it ' s too dangerous . august will never let me go . you don ' t know what he ' s capable of .
how can you be with a man you ' re frightened of ?
in america the cops catch the crooks , not the victim .
ha ha , we do that sometimes here , too . <continued_utterance> is no domestic , then ?
he can stay .
then yes . it is .
which one of your `` bodyguards '' is that ?
whichever one i want .
this whole thing was a shakedown . mcmanus what makes you say that ? <continued_utterance> how many times have you been in a line- up ? it ' s always you and four dummies . the p . d . pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they ' d line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line- . up ? a public defender could get you off of that .
so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?
not <person> ' s uncle but probably the sheriff ' s uncle in federal prison .
so the sheriff had got an uncle who ' s committed a serious crime .
<person> ' t worry . <continued_utterance> oh , by the way , i put some water up to boil for her bottle .
here ' s my license .
why did you say that ?
say what ?
she can ' t be wrong . she ' s a very very very powerful sorceress .
she ' s a bird , <person> .
when ' s the last time you wrestled ?
a couple years ago .
i said come on !
bye , <person> . <person> ' t go nowhere without me . i wan na have your love child . <person> points a vicious finger at <person> .
she can ' t be here without me .
how can you be sure ?
i said . and do you have kids , too ?
no , we both have careers .
did you ?
no . but once i heard .
a piece of advice , mr . <person> : <person> ' t screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it ' s deadlier than uranium .
we ' ll see about that . harmsway glances at his watch . <person> coldly .
like ?
<person> had turned her out . using her the way the romans used to use their daughters when they did business : some pussy to sweeten the pot . <person> was she got picked up in this trick sweep few weeks back .
we can measure wind .
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable .
and neither will i .
oh , alright . you know , i liked <person> desmond . he had his own m . o . <continued_utterance> i cracked the whiteman case with this .
yeah . if i want to smoke should i go outside ?
you shouldn ' t be smoking .
the men step backwards carefully .
. back way off . <continued_utterance> . where ' s the rest . <continued_utterance> so help me i mean it ! !
when the hell did this package arrive ?
will you quit shouting !
what do you mean ?
i mean is it . is it . ?
he wasn ' t able to make it .
he stood you up .
<person> ' t try to go walking on me .
what do you mean , walking ? you think i ' m gon na work somewhere else . you ' ve been very good to me . very honorable .
what ? you don ' t love me ? <continued_utterance> me either .
you don ' t love me ? <continued_utterance> but we ' re so right for each other .
this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
turn the car around .
i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late .
that ' s a lie .
i suppose <person> is the creative force behind all this .
he is .
how else they gon na make dew drops ?
i ' m getting her out of there !
you ' re wrong -- he hurries to catch her . as she turns on him .
why was i assigned to you ? to debunk your work . to reign you in . to shut you down .
cornichons . i love cornichons .
i know .
<person> , dad .
you ' d tell me if there was something wrong , wouldn ' t you , pumpkin ?
so which one of them did these elements come from ?
let ' s probe it when we do the focus group . i think we might have been infiltrated here , and if we have , we ' ve got a big security problem .
we don ' t leave him , we don ' t take him with us . what does that leave ? <continued_utterance> you ' re out of your mind .
he ' s an enemy soldier .
i don ' t know . to be honest with you , i think i ' d rather work alone . he ' s too green . is he a pain in the ass ?
no . he don ' t talk much ; he ' s a good listener , so he can ' t really get on your nerves . he ' s a lousy pool player and he can ' t play cards for shit , but .
so all by yourself , you ' re going to destroy every government ; in the world .
easier than that , buddy . i ' ll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend <person> continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing . pretty soon everyone ' s involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
tomorrow i ' ll wish i was dead .
no you won ' t . you just need to sleep .
what ' s happened ?
nothing . nothing you don ' t know about . <person> ' s the big day . just have the car ready to go if i call or if the civil defense warning comes on .
<person> off .
see what i mean .
<person> is in the kitchen .
how come you didn ' t ask <person> to help you ?
you want a muffin ?
<person> , you are a muffin .
what do you believe ?
believe it or not , i care about you . you ' ve become like family to me . i don ' t want to give up on you . <continued_utterance> but i needed more . i needed an answer . i . i even thought there was more than a good chance someone was playing tricks on you . maybe it was the board . but i can ' t exceed my duties here . i ' m just a psychologist , and i have to leave you .
what ' s the matter ?
this is the package those guys came for , not the baby , you asshole .
i ' m not complainin ' . but give me credit . i ' m the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
<person> came to me . he told me he ' d fire <person> if i didn ' t do it . i went along with him for <person> ' s sake . it was only pattycake , after all .
so , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?
. i figured . i figured you ' d turn back . wes gets a slow boil on .
<person> .
what ?
and you ' ve never done a brave thing in your life ?
maybe there are different ways to be brave . did you know the french have the best carrier pigeons ? and this could be the difference in the war - our messages getting through .
i never heard of it .
it ' s a hellhole . three motels and a mannequin factory . my dad worked there for thirty-five years .
i don ' t get the distinction .
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
what ' s a toby ?
you don ' t want to be at crossroads without one . it ' s a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .
all right . but let ' s keep the price down . i ' ve called <person> . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we ' re going to trial .
if we were to go to trial , would we win the case ?
what ' s that ?
you leave <person> here . with us . until he finishes high school .
sofia . i ' m .
your eyes apologized better . come on .
tell me which ones are my moments and i ' ll try to duplicate them .
this is a moment . you look great .
he ' s got speed . i ' ll give him that . but has he got stamina ?
he has everything .
every time i listen to <person> , i always remember when i used to work in atlantic city back in the late <number> ' s . you know , a busboy job . <person> used to play at the <number> <person> , and we used to take our dates and say , ' hey , you wan na go and hear <person> ? ' then we ' d just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music . i think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown .
i ' d go with you and lean against the door . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got a pretty good aim .
maybe you ' ve got ideas of your own for the gold . maybe you ' ve already got things worked out .
maybe i do .
you were supposed to show up . maybe i wasn ' t .
we were supposed to be together .
<person> , listen , can i .
sure you can , no problem . <person> , i got ta go now , i ' m gon na see if she ' ll share a cab with me . you take the shuttle , okay ?
hi there ! you alright ?
we ' re fine ! how are you ?
it ' s great stuff , isn ' t it ? we ' d go down in a blaze of glory .
oh yeah . i don ' t know what to do . i ' ve got ta take some kind of a story back with me . <person> , eh ?
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
i appreciate you bringing this to our attention . whatever you want , the rest of the night , consider it on the house .
where do you picture me , <person> ?
<number> pennsylvania avenue .
never mind .
<person> . x <number> .
uh uh . not me , daddy , i just reported it . it was the kid .
what kid ?
<person> , breathe .
i heard it tear .
well i do . i ' ve always loved you , <person> . i
did you just make that up ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t write a page when a paragraph will do .
guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views .
we ' re not <person> and/or clark . we ' re gon na stick to one of the ones the <person> said .
the owl told him about <person> . that ' s incredible . i guess we just broke the back of this investigation , didn ' t we ? evidence doesn ' t get any harder than that -- not for my money . is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court ?
he also said `` listen to the water . ``
hey , things could be worse . it could ' ve been my money . let me help you out , rookie .
thanks <person> , i ' ll make it good to you . you know what my dream is ? one day to be on the other end of that phone .
i ' m positive . i trained her myself .
she ' s in the ring with the champ , though . you ' ve heard of alcoholics anonymous ? women anonymous . their biggest case .
you ' re acquainted with every school in the area ?
pretty much , yeah .
i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> broke-heart of nightingale for our honored guest . <continued_utterance> it is <person> ! the prophecy has come true .
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?
i say we use `` the norn ' s <person> . ``
at this close range ? i think `` the alfheim lunge '' is a better move .
what do you mean ? what other package ?
i ' ll take the basket back and give you the other package , here . no mistake .
did he come in with you ?
i guess .
few more hours . maybe . <person> didn ' t skimp on this thing . i got ta bore right through the face plate . you got some time now , why don ' t you get <person> off my back and go work that <person> broad .
you read my mind .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , <person> .
<person> , that ' s insane .
so . i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other , and have this baby , right ? <person> .
<person> .
on top of teresa in bed . all whispers .
when ' s the next business trip , big fella ?
would i what ?
would you kill her ? <continued_utterance> because i ' m sick and tired of her little games . because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again . because i ' ve got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her , and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it .
we are going where the action is . <person> ' t that right , <person> ? let ' s play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up . what would you give to be rich ?
had moms and <person> given me my share of what was mine , i could have been rich by now . <person> and i had it all worked out .
fuck him ! it ' s on my tab . at least i ' ve got six hundred in my pocket right now . it ' s like another loan . <person> , you got to think about today . today , i got six hundred bucks in my pocket . you know what i ' m saying ?
yeah .
i ' m feelin ' like par ' s a bad score , podnuh -- fifty-eight ' s within the realm !
<person> , the doctor lady ' s here --
<person> ' s mother ' s called three times this morning . said she hasn ' t heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn ' t show up for work yesterday or today .
she sure this was the park they were coming to ?
i don ' t kill your brother ! i <person> ' t even know him . i was only <person>out . it was money , they give me twelve dollars ! it was money !
a human life . twelve dollars .
no .
no ?
oh , but you ' re wrong , sir , i know everything !
yes , you found him ! i heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies -
it ' s a secret .
forget it .
congratulations but rarer still is your interest in anacott steel .
the same interest as yours <person> . <person> . i thought it ' d be a good investment for my kid .
<person> says you have to be like me .
he does .
' not tonight ' means maybe some other night ?
i didn ' t mean it like that .
no .
a magician makes magic . any fool can use it .
lions .
mrs . lions , i ' m <person> . i represent the manhattan dental hygiene association . i can offer you a forty percent discount on our toothpicks plus a very attractive selection of toothpick holders if .
who are you ?
oh - i - pay no .
no ! more oil ! much more , you insolent dolt !
with my hands ?
that ' s thirty-three bucks . can you believe that . ?
oh , yeah . your broad from last night .
sure . are you kidding ?
what do you do about it ? i mean , how do you cope ?
i was playing to win .
a defining moment when you tried to hit the same impossible cut
i know .
you know ? then why are you up here looking like you ' re about to jump overboard ? !
you ever think about it ? you ever worry ?
the only thing i worry about is how much iraqi ass i ' m going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over . the only people who i ' ve got anything to worry about are the poor , dumb camel jockeys who don ' t know enough to get out of the way when i come rolling at them ; an m- <number> in each hand , and a grenade between my teeth . now if you ' ll excuse me , soldier , i ' d like to get back to my box . i ' ve got a treasure to find .
what about <person> ? still missing .
and most likely dead . find the son . stakeout the residence . put tails on both the mother and daughter -- i want this investigation working quietly , and around the clock .
what ? ! no please , sir --
she ' s a dental hygienist . she ' ll know what to do .
what ?
the rings ?
<person> rid of him ?
yes . <person> rid of him .
we would never .
if only .
it ' s saturday .
i knew that . you think i didn ' t know that ? <continued_utterance> it ' s today ?
are you ready now ?
yes . say goodbye , <person> . <continued_utterance> yes , i ' m ready now .
i was just waiting for the right time .
and you didn ' t feel like you could trust my wife with this news ?
where ? <continued_utterance> huh ?
this way it ' s close at hand !
i ' ll meet you there .
<person> ' t get out of the car .
this is the personnel file on the programmer , lindenmeyer . there might be something in it you can use .
she wasn ' t part of the deal , <person> .
gus-gus and oh shit , i can ' t remember the other one . why am i compelled to meet her ? i ' m just ruining a good thing .
you ' re taking it to the next level . i always do that . i always take a relationship to the next level , and if it works okay i take it to the next level after that , until i can finally get to the level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave .
this is your standard dart gun .
that one i ' m real familiar with .
<person> was a patriot . the men he ' s loyal to know their way around dallas . they blew that building to hide something . maybe something even they couldn ' t predict .
you ' re saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen . ?
. embarrassing , shameful .
. regression of modern man to his most primitive , ape-like state .
it was over by those rocks .
there .
but you ' re beautiful -- at your age all you need is a good night ' s sleep and you ' ll look like new .
right , a good night ' s sleep -- but when ?
<person> ! but she ' ll be miserable without me . we ' re in love .
then i guess it ' s a good thing <person> is going there too . she ' ll have someone to console her .
i wish it weren ' t true . i swore i ' d never let this happen . i hate you . i hate your beauty , i hate your innocence , i hate the feelings you ' ve awakened in me . <continued_utterance> i ' m in love with you , sorsha . i don ' t want to be , but a power has enchanted me and i stand helpless against it . it ' s torture . battle- field or prison cell was never half as cruel . <continued_utterance> i want you and i can ' t have you so i want you all the more . if this were another time and another place i ' d --
you ' d what ?
<person> . a . k . a .
<person> .
mr . president , you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option . the soviet will only tie you down in negotiation , and leave us short of our goal , the removal of the missiles . negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational , complicating the necessary military task we have at hand . <continued_utterance> for the last fifteen years , i have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet . gentlemen , i do not wish to seem melodramatic , but i do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity . a lesson i have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice . the soviet understands only one language : action . it respects only one word : force . <person> stares at the old man . <person> ' s gaze finds his <continued_utterance> i concur with general taylor . i recommend , sir , air strikes followed by invasion , perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits .
then it appears we have three options . number one . a surgical air strike against the missiles themselves . two , a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles . <person> eyes <person> . <person> is writing something . <continued_utterance> and three , invasion . <continued_utterance> we ' re certainly going to do number one ; we ' re going to take out these missiles , so it seems to me we don ' t have to wait very long . we ought to at least be making those preparations .
-i ' m going to the review board and have you cited for- -keep him off balance . big curveball-
-when ' d <person> start pimping <person> ?
you know - raise baby trout from eggs and then stock the rivers with them . <continued_utterance> entire place used to be a trout farm . seems like most everything used to be something else , doesn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> i you might be new but you seem to know what you ' re doing .
it surprises me more than it surprises you .
we get it at work . we get the magazine at work .
yes , we know that you do . i have it in my files . that ' s at the manhattan health center .
-me . you want me to draw him off-

<person> . <continued_utterance> fuck you .
oh , i disagree .
how can you disagree ? `` there but for the grace of god goes us , '' that ' s what they ' re saying . as if our bodies is who we are , but it ' s not . it ' s our souls is who we are , but they don ' t know that .
i ' m married !
and about to be divorced . have you ever fucked <person> ?
morning , officer .
<person> . little excitement out at the reservation this morning . <person> and <person> were up drinking all night and then <person> starts chasing <person> around the desert with his shotgun . bia handled it . i went by for backup .
i feel like i ' m being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
eventually you ' ll let go .
i ' m ship ' s surgeon . i ' m in charge of aches , pains , biology , math and science .
<person> here is ship ' s cook .

they ' re boxing us in with these rules of engagement . if you agree to ' em , and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won ' t stop for inspection , the chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting . they want a war , and they ' re arranging things to get one . if you don ' t want one , we have to do something about it .
what do you want from me ? i ' m trying to be fair . but i can ' t keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .
then i ' ll write about you .
of course .
i was on the deck of the u . s . s . <person> catching some rays when the north koreans attacked . took a bullet right in the chest , but by luck i had an extra roll of high speed ektachrome in this pocket right here . over the heart .
that ' s ' cause he ' s dead .
oh , <person> .

well , that ' s why <person> never got down off that tower .
how far ' s that ?
' bout eighty kilos southwest .
i told you about calling me boy . i ain ' t no boy . <person> , you and <person> got a bad habit of calling me boy . you call me boy in front of my wife . you think i ' m going to fix the roof ? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain .
i ought to break your damn neck .
i couldn ' t tell you .

i miss my wife ! i miss my chil- dren ! my boy <person> ! he ' s growing up so fast , he even helps me on the farm now ! and little <person> ! if you ever saw her sweet little face you ' d melt <person> , you ' d melt ! or maybe you wouldn ' t . you don ' t know anything about love . you don ' t know anything about any- thing .
i was in love once , <person> . she had a hold on my heart . i could barely function . i was a great swordsman ! i was knighted ! i could have been king !
that ' s probably fair to say .
so , then , do we meekly go back to work and say nothing ? it sounds as though nourish and his realists are preparing to sabotage the trout farm . before you know it , they ' ll be planning to assassinate game designers .
no .
<person> . here we go again .
very happy - now she won ' t be able to hit us with a broom .

that ' s the sweat of a man who hasn ' t an honest bone in his body . <person> ' t be offended , lad . a man who ' s got no ethics is a free man . i envy that . <person> , how can i blame you ? that <person> sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , don ' t she ? eh ? jake nudges <person> who smiles a nervous smile . <continued_utterance> she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don ' t think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ?

`` we few , we happy few , we band of brothers ; / for he today that sheds his blood with me/ shall be my brother ; be he ne ' er so vile . / this day shall gentle his condition ; / and gentlemen in england now a-bed/ shall think themselves accurs ' d they were no here . / and hold their manhood cheap whiles any speaks/ that <person> with us upon <person> ' s day ! ''

that ' s nice .
well , you and your husband are special . ya , <person> tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor . <continued_utterance> how many people do you all feed ?

to figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her , that ' s why .
is she all right ?
i think her leg is fractured .
<person> , <person> ' s diving !
what ?
um . i ' d rather not say . just yet .
<person> .
like most editors , he really wants to be a writer , but he ' s too busy living a novel to bother writing one .
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit .
i don ' t buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly don ' t believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?
because he was my friend .
my father used to hunt in a forest like this . he promised to take me on my tenth birthday . i don ' t know why he picked that year . something about a boy becoming a man . i ' d lay in bed at night and imagine it , just the two of us . but he died before i could go with him .
well . you have your boyhood wish at last . the dark forest . the thrill of the hunt . the nearness of death .
there . with equity and inventory it ' s worth twelve grand . more or less .
this is how you think you can settle up ? by deeding me your driving range ?
-- and the courage that you promised <person> ?
well , i --
<person> ' t be silly . i couldn ' t wait for you to come .
i could go back out to give you more time . or better yet , yell raid and clear the place out so you two can be alone .
no .
who ' s that guy she ' s with ? <person> ' t he used to be in workshop ?
i can ' t kill , <person> . i can ' t kill anybody .
it ' s not like he ' s a young man , <person> . he ' s had time to live . it ' d be quick . i mean , he wouldn ' t even have to
i want to check the set-ups for tomorrow ' s insurance convention . <continued_utterance> give me a shot from his wedding band .
he took it off .
you crazy ? he might be inside already ?
chance we got to take . we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged .
why haven ' t they killed us ! ?
i don ' t know !
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but don ' t think we ' re friends . i ' m sorry , but i have other things -
they ' re gon na do a job . three million dollars , maybe more .
how would you know ?
trust me donut . i know .
oh , really ? and how would you know ?
i ' ve read plenty of books . the diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich . i ' m in favor of natural methods , mrs . breathmint .
alphabetically seems . fair .
when it comes to you and women , fairness rarely applies .
what are you doing back so soon ? what about hiking to the gas station ?
it was closed . i was going to leave a note , but i didn ' t . you know . <person> anything to write with .
i am on the staff of .
<person> for women . excuse me , what is that , a joke ? let me tell you something , <person> , those men at catherine laboure . men who are known not only in this city , but the world , were trying to save a woman ' s life . they were there , and here you are , four years later , read some hospital report , and say .
i make jam . we have no animals .
but there ' s fresh hay in your barn .
wait a minute , whoa . we can ' t go now . what ' s <person> got planned with that nerve agent ?
it doesn ' t matter anymore , forget it .
. almost nine minutes . causing brain damage .
your honor . ! your honor .
is he ok ?
he seems it . he ' s just sitting there .
well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows .
what ? ! we just had it fixed three months ago .
we ' re not moving .
oh . i let the answering machine pick up the other call . <continued_utterance> great .
what ?
you -- <person> : you said to me , ' if not now , when . '
i see .
later .
i think i might ' ve said i was in love with you . <person> ' s face remains . unchanged . grady he told you .
he told me .
you through ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll ask again . how well do you know the bible ?
not very .
different culture . <person> to penetrate . the indians don ' t like white cops poking around . and that ' s why we ' re in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent .
with an indian representative out there , we hope to keep hostilities dormant ; this is a cointelpro , selective operations unit , and it ' ll be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people ' s trust and maybe --
you ' re a vision , <person> , a goddamn vision of loveliness , you always are .
have another drink , thelma .
oh , it ' s nothing .
<person> ' t say that . <person> ' t belittle yourself . <person> where credit is due . you did it fine .
and then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated --
who ' s intimidated ? i just told you i ' m gon na win the damn thing !
she has turned against you .
purify the altar ! arrange the im- plements ! i ' ll deal with <person> !
where can i find him ?
him ? he , is a she - at the bar .
how long have you been married ?
twelve years .
well , i ' m a little muddled . the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east . and there ' s the house , and here you are , and that ' s all . <continued_utterance> . is , are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?
oh , but i ' ve already told you , i ' m not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly . what was that ? mcu -- <person> looks to r . f . g . and speaks --
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association . the world is a hologram , <person> .
yes , it ' s a great big psychedelic circus ride , isn ' t it , <person> ?
<person> had a good fastball , but <person> has a curveball and a screwball that are better .
you will give my autographed baseball to <person> and tell him in five years i will be pitching with him , okay ? he better watch out for me , eh ?
it ' s just ail that crap he spins out . just once i ' d like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth .
the-truth . i know that ' s always been real important to you . <person> , check this out . <continued_utterance> finally , the door opened . it-was a shock to : see him , shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter . limping . <person> . ' sound like anyone we know ? but it was later , when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight . <person> glow of twilight ? this kid definitely needs an editor . . and muttered simply , `` it means nothing . all of it .
what ?
my <person> -- she ' s not in japan , she ' s single , and she ' s got no rugrats . she does have a little gambling problem , she plays the football cards a bit too much , but she ' s a babe , a surgeon babe !
the house of odin is full of traitors .
do not dishonor my father ' s name with your lies .
it takes a key . he keeps it on himself all the time . i mean <continued_utterance> kill him .
i can ' t kill , <person> . i can ' t kill anybody .
<person> been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the <number> ' s . this town ' s all inbreeding .
well , people got ta get by somehow . that ' s the curse . the mines done it . all that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! everybody ' s got a mother . you don ' t rip up your mother . you don ' t rip up the <person> and take everything out . it ' s like the cracker jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want . `` .
but i put cologne on .
is that what that smell is ?
my name ' s mel .
oh , sorry . <person> ever tell you you look just like <person> ?
does it have something to do with another guy ? are you in love with him ?
it ' s nothin ' like that .
yes you did . last night . to your friend
i didn ' t mean it that way .
<person> of the bookstore .
why not ? you said you thought she was attractive .
ted !
it ' s alright , boy . it ' s alright . it ' s alright . it ' s alright .
that ' s funny : you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
<person> to me ! i ' m a british secret service agent . and we have about two minutes before harmsway kills both of us .
i don ' t know .
<person> -- listen to me . i ' m going home , then i ' m booking a flight to dallas . i ' m getting you a ticket , too .
<person> and <person> said it ' s yours . they seem to think you ' re coming home .
you can have it , then . i ' m not going back there .
now hold on . there ' s a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
i ' m sorry . i ' m sure it is . <continued_utterance> tonight i ' ll let out those trousers for you .

i got a problem with you not doing your job , burbank . you already screwed up once this week .
let me worry about that .
our police are afraid of them . please get them out of here . <continued_utterance> they ' re going to kill me next . that ' s what i hear . these new indians are destroying everything . our people are a quiet people .
they can lead us to <person> . <person> let them go . we ' re tightening the net on him . we know he ' s on the reservation .
he ' s in love with a girl who ' s dead . it _is_ dangerous for you to have it . i ' m sorry .
i ' m so sorry , <person> .
it ' s gone ! some . malfunction .
toldya the <person> assembled [ stuff don ' t work . ]
<person> . now that i ' m home .
<person> . i ' m sorry if things didn ' t work out so well for you tonight . with <person> .
this is how you think you can settle up ? by deeding me your driving range ?
only on condition you don ' t sell right away , and me ' n <person> keep our jobs .
sure . whatever you want . for old time sake . <continued_utterance> looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who ' s better than who , don ' t we , <person> ? like i said ; i expected more from you .
it ' s like i said ; you don ' t really know lieutenant <person> very well , do you ? <continued_utterance> damn it . we lost the horses .

well , thats so good to hear , <person> . you know some of us depend on you down this way . youre so entertainin and you get so many interestin guests .

you got ta promise to feed her .
well , <person> , you ' ve done a very good job , but we ' ll take care of it from here . <continued_utterance> we ' ve been following these narco- trafficantes for some time but had not been able to bring them to justice . put the prisoners in the car . impound the truck . <continued_utterance> one question . how did you find about this ?
an informant .
it ' s better than real . it ' s synthetic flesh . <person> blood . <person> organs . it ' s a physiological machine .
this is supposed to be years away .
<person> . that was part of the problem .
who ' s car did you steal ?
what ?
it ' s from the godfather . it means you have to go to war .
what do you mean ?
i mean it ' s open . anyone ' s got a shot at it . you just got ta get past a local and a sectional qualifier , and unlike doral or colonial or the a . t . t . , they can ' t keep you out . they can ' t ask you if you ' re a garbageman or a bean- picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper . you qualify , you ' re in .
you can ' t quit , <person> .
i can , <person> . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --

you want to use your old desk ? someplace to sit down ?
i want to put the game on pause . <continued_utterance> the game can be paused , can ' t it ? i mean , all games can be paused , right ?
sure , yeah , but why ? what ' s wrong ? <person> ' t you dying to see what ' s special about the special ?
that ' s the first good thing i ' ve heard about him .
his address . no , no , no . he would never do anything that prosaic . on <person> , looking a little wounded . kathleen the only thing i really care about besides the married thing . and the jail thing . is the boat thing .
<person> , that rings a bell . <person> told me somebody lookin like her was at the nothin fancy yesterday .
<person> right . <person> check it out .
i ' ve heard they ' ve got snakes that ' ll outrun a horse through the grass . they got a snake that bites you . you got eleven seconds to live . no thank you . i don ' t want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy . i ' d like to go to a place where . hold it !
what ' s wrong ?
no .
you an indian ?
all right , what ' s that doing on the back of the bike ? <continued_utterance> you wouldn ' t by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle , would you ?
of course not , <person> . we ' d never do something like that .
i don ' t see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . not even a sewer or a storm drain .
you ' re sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman ' s body in the morgue ?
where were you ? on a . uh , mission ?
ssshhh ! we say op . <person> operation . and this one got a little rough .
running away is all they have .
yet we taught `em opposite . running into the fray .
like i said <person> , he ' s flipped his lid . i don ' t want to go to internal affairs but i ' m afraid <person> might ' ve forced just that .
let me try to locate the lad first <person> . be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon .
<person> , no . the other falls are clear on the other side . it would take you a couple nights just to get there .
maybe next time .
it ' s not falling asleep . you ' ve only been standing there for three minutes .
i ' m the one who can feel my leg , and it ' s falling asleep .
i doubt it was drugs , more likely a problem with a nerve . i could recheck the arm for injuries , but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland .
i think that ' s a good idea . <continued_utterance> i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park .
<person> ' s been taken down . he was working for <person> .
what ? i thought <person> was dead . i thought it was verified .
maybe we should give him some water .
all last night he could have been --
about a hundred and ten . you wan na step out of the car , please ? <continued_utterance> is this your car ?
yes .
where ? !
about twelve miles east of here .
she threw up in her mask . <person> ' s cut the bullshit . say it : she threw up
she threw up in her mask .
and for heaven ' s sake , practice your horsemanship .
horsemanship . got it .
but why didn ' t you kennel that dog right away ?
i told you i couldn ' t find . . get that out of my face .
i ' ll stop . i ' ll try . i probably can ' t . i see one and my knees go weak . <person> , what were you starting to say ?
when ?
<person> , sir .
and how old are you , <person> ?
about what --
about the consequences of the promises you made .
you speak french ?
i speak french , english , <person> , <person> , and <person> .
thank you for seeing me .
that ' s perfectly all right .
perhaps in appreciation for our country ' s pursuit of peace , you might offer us some , token of gratitude .
what do you want ?
i ' m not watching you for him anymore .
if you ' re planning on shaking me down for `favors , ' go pick-up your paycheck mr . <person> . or are you being a policeman right now ?
<person> guessed it , thats sure .
<person> for another ?
oh yeah ? and how do you think he should behave ?
i think he shouldn ' t have to run and tell his mommy every time he does something she might not like , for one thing .
hey look ! it ' s <person> !
yeah , hey <person> . <person> ' s show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake . gim me five , man !
as a matter of fact , falling down was a tactic . lulling the destroyer into a false sense of security !
well , i was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield . that makes me the real hero . <person> ' t it , <person> ?
<person> , right .
you ' re going to stay in school .
who ? bond ? bond is dead . <continued_utterance> somehow , i find that strangely . disappointing .
<person> . what time is it ?
what ?
i said . and do you have kids , too ?
a piece of shrapnel hit me .
i ' m sick of that guy . <person> ' s stop playing nice .
<person> , if you think all of this is going too fast , maybe i should move out . is that what you want , <person> ? <continued_utterance> i really care for you , but if you think it ' s best . i don ' t want to make you unhappy .
i don ' t think we ' ve got to take drastic action . <continued_utterance> thought i ' d come by and get things off my chest . talk it out . <person> , i ' m going over to pimlico . catch the seventh race . wan na come ?
let me do the talking . you are very pretty . you may start by unzipping your dress . <continued_utterance> no no . do it slowly . <person> slowly . <continued_utterance> now slip the dress down . slowly . <continued_utterance> now slide the nylons off one by one .
i ' m not wearing any .
and it doesn ' t cramp your style ?
<person> , no . well except for the lint .
it ' s your time of the month again . <continued_utterance> at least once a month . <person> ' s obsession . for twelve years you ' ve been talking about <person> .
people do go to <person> , you know .
oh , happy day .
you got ta be kiddin ' me . they picked up a murderer ? !
<person> ?
you know , choo choo . goes on tracks . wo woo .
<person> , wise ass , show me .
something like that .
right . she ' s only fourteen .
uh huh . and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm . i say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin ' her .
no . not like you . <continued_utterance> what the -- ? !
so you agree you need help ?
i don ' t know . it doesn ' t even matter anymore . i just want you to be happy . it ' s not that i don ' t love you either . but <person> , your timing couldn ' t be worse .
are you just doin ' this to punish me ?
<person> , he succeeded <person> . <continued_utterance> and i ' m tired of <person> elevators . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t leave me .
i already have .
<person> . i was kind of wondering what happened to you today .
oh -- <person> ' t <person> -- i had a false alarm about my son .
they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .
i say to myself , look at the map . look what ' s all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they ' d throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they ' re shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot .
what is it you find incredible ?
well . where would you like me to start ? <person> is a long way from dallas , <person> . i can ' t very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you ' ve made here . bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism .
nice of you to turn up .
he ' s got speed . i ' ll give him that . but has he got stamina ?
<person> ' t judge a comic book by it ' s cover .
you agree with a lot of what he says , don ' t you .
oh my god .
it was really stupid .
i ' ll keep that in mind .
i see my date is here . and i think mr . <person> is ready to leave .
their weapons missing ?
<person> <number> . <number> is now armed .
and you don ' t want to show me your face .
no .
sit . you ' re supposed to sit .
i could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either .
say hello to freud for me .
dr . m , this hurts !
but we did want you . it ' s just that you don ' t always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .
i have learned to live with death .
countess , i ' m very grateful for what you ' ve done , but i can ' t stay here . i ' ve got .
or anywhere where people might see us .
<person> ' s a very jealous person .
<person> . just call me <person> . we ' ll take these books .
these are wonderful books . as <person> gets older the characters in the books do , too . you can grow up with <person> .
that ' s the way i planned it .
<person> , <person> , i ' m closing my practice . most of my patients are on the west side but i have one case i ' d like to refer you .
she ' s right across the room and she ' s burning a hole in my back right now , isn ' t she ?
red dress , strappy shoes ?
you promised .
<person> ' t i just give them money ? that ' s the cause ? <person> writers ? i ' m for that . <continued_utterance> all right , i ' ll go . you ' re late .
it better be .
the map . <continued_utterance> the map .
you ' ve got to relax , baby , you ' re paranoid . <continued_utterance> hey , you ' re good .
maybe we should start again , yes ? i know so little about you , except that you ' re not what you say you are .
if you or any of your friends harm her , as old as i am , i will kill you .
you know , i was going to give you back your pot . but now i ' m going to keep it . for soup .
why ?
why what ?
just a little surprise .
what ?
<person> , sir ? that ' s great news !
yes . i miss the army .
we ' ve never actually met . my name ' s-
<person> , i know . i was beginning to think we ' d never meet . this is fortuitous . that means lucky .
please .
. that it will take all the skill which we can muster to lead him successfully to a recognition of his severe physical limitations without crushing him . ``
i ' m sorry --
-- i don ' t know if you ' re alive or dead --
my name is <person> . <person>uel .
<person> down !
i ' m not getting paid enough .
i care about what i do and so should you !
i ' ll bet . who made the call ?
some old broad heard an `argument ' and buzzed <person> .
<person> kelly , lovely woman . i think we might have had a date once . or maybe we just exchange letters .
you wrote her letters ?
i know your mother ain ' t still operating that house of hers .
my mother passed on years ago .
we haven ' t had a decent night ' s sleep in two weeks . <person> ' s probably going to lose a $ <number> , <number> contract .
<person> couldn ' t leave . <person> almost jumped out the window . it ' s lucky they even made it to the finals !
no one touch a thing `til i say . <continued_utterance> dave-
-lieutenant <person> . i said `meet me ' in twenty minutes ' not `go in without me . '
yes , i am confident that <person> will be taken into custody before the end of the year . but , you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force . we get a tip that he is one place , then we get there and he is already gone , having been warned by someone on our side .
hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem .
okay boys , smile ! <continued_utterance> all right . as you were .
will you please call the chair people ?
no , sir . i ' m not going to be around long if that ' s what you ' re worried about .
that ' s a nasty cut you got there .
i ' m sorry i turned the lights down . it didn ' t work anyway . i can turn them back up if you like --
<person> ' t .
there is , but it ' s not that interesting .
so where have you been staying ?
you ' re in a lot of trouble , mrs . <person> , so i suggest you cooperate . if we want to know the most intimate details of your life , you ' d better tell us .
my husband is a good man .
hell , no . i was just bein ' friendly .
it ' s a good thing they ' re not all as friendly as you .
why have you done this ?
to do what <person> never could . to destroy their kind forever . when he awakens , he ' ll see the wisdom of what i ' ve done .
where the hell is it ! ?
just stay down .
<person> , okay . i ' ll just . be over here .
you ' re sure about him ?
<person> . i just wan na slow down <person> . no more calls for awhile , no lunches . we suspend our business , alright .
sure <person>er , whatever you want , it ' s cool .
you ain ' t thinking about shanking , you ain ' t thinking about the doctor lady , you ain ' t thinking period . you just lookin ' like a fool and hittin ' it pure -- your natural state .
fuck you .
it was the police . they have <person> .
what ? why ?
that womans laugh creeps me out . i heard somethin like that . somewhere before . <person> like the wicked witch .
just sounded like an old gal havin a good time to me . you ready to dance ?
but it ' s great p . r . so what ' s the upside ?
simple . and it could happen . <person> destroys the terrorist insurgents , rebuilds the country , shitcans the purveyors of excess , stabilizes the cordoba , and is finally beloved as the savior of nicaragua . our pal . got a smoke ?
<person> ! <continued_utterance> what do we do now ?
you won ' t want to watch . <person> around .
you may speak .
i have a job for you and i don ' t have much time .
<person> , laser .
i ' m having corrective eye surgery over the break .
-- a fucking cop . <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> police .
he ' s a fucking cop .
i think <person> would find this a little more than surprising .
<person> left me this morning .
i ' m sorry , sir , i don ' t have the authorization to do that .
then put somebody on who does !
objection , we ' ve .
. to get her heartbeat back . ?
go to hell .
it was just like before , wasn ' t it ? wasn ' t it ? but you are making progress . instead of killing seven people to get the one you ' re after , this time there was only one other person involved .
<person> ' s .
can i ask you something about her ?
no , i ' m sorry . <person> . thank you for coming here .
nothing could have stopped me . <continued_utterance> <person> well , brother .
my guess is because he let people pay him in beans and eggs or whatever they had , instead of money .
and so he ' s penalized for not turning away people who couldn ' t afford his help ? he was a doctor .
you meant . nothing . to me . <continued_utterance> one . last . screw ?
oh <person> . she begins to turn the screw . . when several gunshots are heard outside . <person> is on the edge of consciousness .
but that doesn ' t make sense . that takes a couple of days , doesn ' t it ?
three or four even .
that rat-fink-fuck !
you watch your language . this is a christian home . we ' re sending <person> to <person> cole des arts and literatures in <person> .
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , <person> ?
<person> has shielded it with a spell of her own .
they ' ll be dead by dawn .
a comforting thought . <person> night , d ' <person> . enjoy it . morning comes quickly .
i know .
i won ' t even discuss it .
i , ah . i ' ve been trained by the very best .
so have i . where do you plan to have lunch ?
oh , big , big deal , who cares , and as long as we ' re passing out news here , i don ' t want to do my paper route anymore .
i bet you don ' t -- big lazy candy hog like you ' d rather lay on his ass and read , wouldn ' t you ? let me tell you something : you ' re gon na deliver those papers if i have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever ' step of the way .
as a heart attack .
thanks-whoa , <person> , careful ^here .
i don ' t want to be either .
when ' s she out of here ?
' <person> i love you . inching closer .
and i love you too .
on three ? you call it .
here it come : one-two-
<person> ! ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! !
woah . woah . !
go to my hotel room . i ' ll be there in twenty minutes .
just - say it . say it just once .
<person> call . so we just need a new strategy , that ' s all . what about that judge that ' s always throwing work your way ? can ' t she help you out ?
judge <person> , yeah . if it wasn ' t for her i ' d probably be out of business already . i just need more .
you mean to make up my mind to marry her ?
yeah . how did ya know ? <continued_utterance> this nora is a pain in the ass , <person> . a pain in the ass . it ' s worse now than when she used to be around . <continued_utterance> you wan na hear something ? the other night at the corral club , i turned down a dance .
uh , well , that ' s not really his problem , <person> .
oh really ? what ' s his problem ?
<person> .
<person> needs to go to the grocery store . i ' ve offered her your help in carrying her bags .
what did i say ?
do you see any telletubbies around here ? . do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? . do you see a little asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it ? . no ? . well that ' s what you see at a toy store ? any you must think this is a toy store , cause you ' re in here shopping for an infant named <person> . one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person ' s valuable time . <continued_utterance> this is an art gallery my friend . this is piece of art . <continued_utterance> this is one of seventeen original drawings by <person> remaining in the world . it ' s value will triple every year . this piece is to be treasured . to be cherished . to be coveted by every single one of your banker friends that think they ' re better than you .
i don ' t know . i ' m all right .
really ? you sure ?
i don ' t want courage . i don ' t want to be a warrior . all i ' ve ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
real magic , <person> , is simply the art of controlling the reality of others . you lack faith in your- self . you must learn to trust your intuition . <continued_utterance> go in the direction the bird is flying .
you should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find . what ' d she scam you out of-some insurance dough ?
nah , some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend .
not yet ? love taking your shots , don ' t ya ?
when i see an opening .
i don ' t want you to worry . i ' m handling it . but i might send my friend <person> out there .
you don ' t think it ' s safe ?
i know . i remember .
well ? .
coin toss ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> all right , fritz - you ' re on .
general lemay , do you truly believe that ' s our best course of action ?
mr . president , i believe it is the only course of action . american is in danger . those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent . without our deterrent , there ' s nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war . it ' s our duty , our responsibility to the american people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation . the big red dog is digging in our back yard , and we ' re justified in shooting him .
what the hell ' d you wait for ? <continued_utterance> no ! you get it !
<person> ' t i tell you ? bobby there must be <number> , <number> thousand here ! <continued_utterance> we done it , <person> . oh my god ! <continued_utterance> fuck me baby ! bobby what about him ? <continued_utterance> let him watch . i want him to know what he ' s missing .
anybody sick ?
no , i . i don ' t mean infection . or disease .
<person> . it sure is .
i always wanted to travel . i just never got the opportunity .

of course i remember you .
i ' m dangerous . you ' re not afraid of me ?
you ' re not dangerous .
my apologies , mr . renaissance man .
you want to talk about renaissance men , you got ta talk about <person> . <person> unorthodox trainer , and one of the best in the game . he ' s well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm , to remain patient , and to remain composed under pressure .
what the hell are you talking about ?
nothing . i ' m not going to be around for a while . i ' ll call you when i can .
you ' re getting gold , and you ' re going to blow it on wheels ?
what are you going to do with your <continued_utterance> oh , that ' s fun .
<person> . i love her .
and she ' thinks ' she loves you .
you heard me , <person> .
<person> , you don ' t understand-
sue me . <person> me to court . oh , <person> , i know you ' re disappointed , but .
<person> . call me <person> .
everyone in the room flinches .
you know . i have a feeling he is around here somewhere . and if he cares about you . if he wants to see your lovely face again . he should show up before it ' s too late .
it hurts . the pain . it ' s tearing me .
<person> , give her a hand .
the photos . <continued_utterance> some good ones .
they ' re all good ones . satellites we ' ve got can snap a shot of the boil on <person> ' s ass .
now pay attention , <number> . we haven ' t much time to demonstrate your new <person> toys .
how is old <person> ?
<person> .
<person> , he succeeded <person> . <continued_utterance> and i ' m tired of <person> elevators . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t leave me .
it ' s funny . i know he ' s hiding somewhere with the amish , i know it . can you imagine <person> at a prayer meeting ? our <person> ? <continued_utterance> either you ' re a member of the club or you aren ' t , <person> . tell me what you know .
what i know , <person> , is . he ' s going to take you out .
so are we still friends ?
mm hm . sure .
she must have known someone .
i ' ll get my kit .
miserable <person>s . <continued_utterance> that ' s more like it .
do any other daikinis ever come by here ?
what , <person> ? what do you remember ?
on <person> . they tried to kill me . and .
i . yes . it is .
and you wrote that .
no , not me . it ' s <person> . my girlfriend . you met her with me yesterday . something ' s happened to her . she was gone this morning when i woke up . i looked everywhere and i couldn ' t find her . we need to call someone . a ranger . somebody . we need to find her right away . do you have a phone ?
i ' m sorry , but i don ' t . never really had use for one . i do have a radio . we can call down to base if you ' d like . <continued_utterance> after we take care of you .

how ' d you know ?
i got one up on ya .
how will you fix it ?
i ' ll go in with a team . but first i ' m going to need some intel . i ' ll have to put someone inside , someone new , someone they won ' t see coming . one of their own .
it ' s not for you to make decisions for me .
i think maybe i should , because i think you ' re being misled . i think you ' re confused . i think .
i ' m sorry . please give her my best .
of course .
<person> .
<person> ' t pout , <person> . i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story . he ' s from ' <person> ' s of london . ' . <person> ' t you , mr . <person> ?

you were never one of those atheists , were you ?
no , i ' m not saying that , but i ' m beginning to give god more thought .
at least you could consider it , honey . for me . i ' ve never asked you for anything before .
maybe i could take him , but i ' d have certain conditions . i would have to be the only dad on the scene . <person> would have to go .
the war is here ! in towns and vil- lages like this ! <continued_utterance> you ' re chasing a dream .
just get me some horses .
no .
why not ? it ' s three am .
so what was it about ? your book . what was the story ?
i don ' t know .
are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some . artificially injected fantasy ?
no , not quite . we didn ' t give you this . you ' re creating it yourself -- remember the option we offered you ? intelligence agent ? something inside you liked that idea , fastened on it . what you ' re experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating .
i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that ' s where the light comes from . <person> ' t see it with the lanternon .
the white dot ; light in the dark . <continued_utterance> maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
what are you talking about ?
what do you think you are doing ?
you listen to me . you take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road . run it out on someone who doesn ' t know you like i do .
c ' mon , brendan . i thought maybe we could break bread . open some lines of communication .
oh , alright . you know , i liked <person> desmond . he had his own m . o . <continued_utterance> i cracked the whiteman case with this .
<person> , i heard all about it .
<person> is a criminal .
<person> was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u . s . government . so , no , i don ' t have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government , fighting people like you , trying to keep this system a little bit honest .
you did too --
i did not --
if you don ' t say so .
. if i don ' t say so myself , yeah . top notch performance . what , you disagree ?
you queered the fed ' s <person> by killing that boxer and they already had a hard-on for the lapd- <person> sent you down here as damaged goods . think about it . everybody sees what ' s coming . now close this quick .
the god-sized problems i triggered tossing <person> take shape : the lapd ' s sanctioned dope-pusher vanishes -- that ' s a pretty juicy spot to stick a new probe .
i ' m looking for my daughter , <person> . she comes here .
this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
no cop will testify against other cops . this is why <person> has suddenly disappeared .
and how . so where do we go now chief ?
anybody ever tell you you ' re an egomaniac and a prick , <person> ' <person> ?
you need to be the best you ' ve ever been .
well . if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school . in the long run you ' d save them thousands of dollars . i mean look at the cost of dental bills . i bet i could have put my kids through college with what i ' ve spent on fillings .
that ' s an interesting point .
is maybe . the inside woman .
a woman ?
how is that possible ?
elliot , go to your father and stand on his left side .
i hope you don ' t mind my asking , but are you <person> ?

my folks split my freshman year , so i spend the holidays racing between them . two trees . two turkey dinners . two sets of presents to return for store credit . so normally i can deal , but this year mom decided to rent a condo at the beach . which is like , what ? two hours away .
oh yeah - sure . okay .
<person> . it isn't .
i am mad at you ! and at landon ! and the universe ! and god ! i don ' t even know where to put all my anger .
that ' s normal . god accepts your anger . he won ' t punish you .
as long as your friend doesn ' t try to take my sister for a sleigh ride .
if he tries it , i ' ll smash his flexible flyer . it ' s all set .
how ' s he doing ?
oh , he ' s doing really well . he ' s going to the high school here and he ' s wrestling on the team actually .
yes . yes . that ' s exactly it . yes .
<person> . <continued_utterance> at-at-at-at-at .
he always quits , he always comes back .
nonetheless , from the mental aspect -- which is my domain -- you have regressed and are fumbling somewhere between delusion and denial .
we use the nervous systems of specially-bred insects to create the electronic circuits on our motherboards . <continued_utterance> <person> has it .
wow . and where do the batteries go ?
that guy ' s starting another fund ?
yeah . he ' s an animal . he prints money . come on , let ' s finish strong .

you been made , macready .
<person> ' s trying to mark me , you bastard . trying to frame me .
i could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either .
i ' ll tell you what i hate . big fat legs like stumps .
so that ' s what we ' re doing .
no we ' re not . the bodies are all mixed up . we can ' t do this to them .
yes , and for that you ' re charged with aiding and abetting . but we ' ll let <person> handle that .
hey , doesn ' t the rabbit even get a last request ?
um . i ' m in the midst of a slight predicament .
what do you need ? money ?
really ?
<person> , i thought i mentioned that to you .
i ' m meeting a player from temple university . he ' s a cornerback . you like football ?

that . and you . <continued_utterance> i ' m not going to draw the map for you on this one , <person> . <person> like these you have to do your own navigating . <continued_utterance> who ' s that sitting in your car ?
<person> .
that was stapled to the cover . why would <person> worry about a turd like me now . when a high profile target like you can be taken down .
where is <person> ?
<person> bet .
in international news , india plans to release crocodiles in the ganges , the holy hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually , to scavenge for corpses , authorities said .
i want .

<person> , but i like the sun . i grew up on a reservation . the sun , the desert ; they like a religion to us . <person> ' s the same way . he loves the desert . i guess we ' re alike that way . that ' s about the only way .
you love him ?
maybe they ' re as scared of us as we are of them .
just seems weird they didn ' t chase us .
i ' m serious .
i ' m serious . i ' m the serious one here . i ' m the one making the play . i ' m the indian runner . and i want my money .
then you ' re safe . if he wanted to break in , he wouldn ' t be calling you .
<person> , can ' t you help me ? i ' m all alone .
<person> ' t get near ' em . the plants ! they ' re alive . those things can imitate anything .
what ' s it going to do , being a plant ?
no , if i fall in front of thousands of people i lose everything but their pity . they ' ll be writing my obituary before i get up off the floor .
<person> won ' t let you fall , he ' ll be there . all the arrangements have been made , boss . it ' ll be fine .
which one do you like best ?
i like them both .
leave her out of this !
and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive .

<person> .
<person> -

yeah . it ' s in his file . <person> ' s office .
couple of months . the doctor says it ' s stress .

what the hell was the gold doing on that boat ?
maybe i better start our homework .
<person> , i suppose i should go home .
home .
what about the car ? i left it at the pier .
i didn't want to say it . but i had a feelin <person> was up to somethin with your mama .
my mama . so <person> , our histories have been somewhat intertwined .
are you board-certified in anesthesiology , <person> ?
no , i am not . it ' s quite common in new york state .
i hope when you were on the bench , judge <person> , you didn ' t handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion .
if i ever return to the bench , <person> , i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments .
like what ?
you know . things .
he shut down your paper ! you ' re stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches !
a good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade . i ' m honing my craft .
forget it .
you know , <person> , i ' m not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
not just the biggest golf tournament in the world ; the most democratic .
what do you mean ?
what about <person> ?
nothing about him , unless he ' s got a problem about me dealing with you .
hes twenty-four now ? a year older than you ? and must be bout bald .
theres worse things that can happen to a man , honey .

what ' s the best thing i can see tonight ?
what happened to <person> ?
suicide .
how would she know ?
but i ' m really not here to try to get you to do anything , or to believe anything . and i ' ll tell you the same thing i told her , which is that as far as i ' m concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you , by the way she lives her life . <continued_utterance> and that doesn ' t mean she ' s supposed to be a saint , either , if that ' s what you ' re smiling about .
it ' s just ' cause i haven ' t slept in four nights -- she must be teething or something , i don ' t know but i can ' t manage .
<person> ' t worry , it ' s nothing , she ' s
why not ? whether he ' s here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day . unless you want him hanging out here ?
ok . go .
go home , <person> . it ' s late .
<person> dressed , <person> .
that ' s all i ever wanted !
then i will teach you .

i set up fisher with the broker that found his house . <person> care of that one , didn ' t i ? prison communications .
she has a job in the carousel .
<person> , you ' re wrong ! she went to new york because she ' s so in love with someone here she just couldn ' t stand it .
mr . price . you must accept our deepest apologies for the misunderstanding . <person> saw you taking photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub -- our young officers get carried away . they ' re always looking for traitors .
that film is half way to new york by now .
<person> ' t be retarded . we were doing research for our girlfriends .
oh , right . i forgot . that ' s a relief . so you ' ll leave the door open ?
oh , yeah . your broad from last night .
thanks , franky .
<person>f course it is . but the president needs to realize we ' re going to have to stop a ship eventually .
the chiefs are looking for a provocation out there . the president ' s going to come under enormous pressure . you have to keep ' em on a short leash , <person> . mcnamara spares <person> a short , nasty look .
<person> . you sat in front . i saw you there .
you were lost in the music . eyes closed . your chest heaving .
sure you don ' t want us to post some backup units ?
if we need any help , we ' ll give you a shout . i ' d like to slip in there quiet , then get out before we attract any attention .
i ' m here to congratulate my friends and their children . i ' m leaving again tonight .
<person> ' t bother . i ' m taking a trip .
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this . and no one had a machine like this .
that ' s good .
<person> takes bishop at <person> four -- <person> take pawn at <person> two -- <person> takes <person> at <person> one -- checkmate .
aw shit . <continued_utterance> <person> , hon . <continued_utterance> never any damn ice around here .
what are you going to do with your <continued_utterance> oh , that ' s fun .
it ' s not about being fun . it ' s about being smart . you take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you don ' t ever have to do anything again . ever . that ' s freedom . that ' s what i ' m talking about .
yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?
was your family traveling with you ?
the `` shoe '' books ? who ' s the author ?
i don ' t know . my friend told me my daughter has to read the `` shoe '' books , so here i am .
and it ' s what you need to burn <person> to the ground . but if those files and his body were to be given to <person> and the feds , with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop . well . the word `cataclysmic ' comes to mind .
what will this cost ?
she ' s got us . now , listen , the plan is : we have done our last job in perfection .
that ' s the plan .
everybody smile .
one more , please ! una mas , por favor ? <continued_utterance> we help each other , right ? could you move your girlfriend into the sun .
<person> ' s face it , we ' re not exactly setting the world on fire .
it ' s a slump . it ' s a slump , <person> .
<person> , thanks a lot , <person> -- believe them instead of me .
if you care anything about me at all , you ' ll shut up .
i think it ' s the best thing .
i think it ' s the best thing , too .
go to hell .
it ' s gon na be like that , huh ? you got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else . why ' s that ?
you can wait out here .
you ' ll be meeting <person> . my personal role model .
i didn ' t ask for an extra bed . <continued_utterance> are you all right with the sofa ? if you like , i can have them bring one up ?
no , no , no . the sofa ' s fine . <person> in fact .
forget him . it ' s not important . i was trying to make a point .
this whole thing was a shakedown . mcmanus what makes you say that ? <continued_utterance> how many times have you been in a line- up ? it ' s always you and four dummies . the p . d . pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they ' d line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line- . up ? a public defender could get you off of that .
she isn ' t here .
when . when will she be back ?
i couldn ' t agree with you more .
go ahead then . my accountant will contact you .
what do you know about spirits ? you ain ' t no in ' dn .
<person> knew something heavy and was trying to tell <person> . but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered . do you realize what <person> could have told <person> ? ! do you ? !
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
yes , i do .
we understand your feelings , ms . <person> . but please , we ' d like some time with <person> . we ' d like to take her statement alone .
are you okay for this ? <continued_utterance> the man must be insane to think he can do this to me .
how ' m i gon na relax standing on a mine ! ?
we ' re going to get off , all right . we ' ll get you off of there . just . be cool .
you heard <person> say `` sam . `` that was <person> on the phone . and you saw the girls .
<person> . the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible . what we have here , is you on the van ryan property , without a proper warrant , shooting a porn flick .
<person> and <person> were not terribly prudent in terms of providing for the possibility of the unforeseen .
what are you talking about ?
he said he doesn ' t know .
he just did the gettysburg address in sioux . what did he say ?
telephone poles . they must have a junction box or something to test the lines . there ! see that one ?
so ?
if she was a par three , i ' d ' a made a nine .
<person> and distance , eh ?
not like this . we were never like this . i want to go over there . after dinner , we can --
why ?
all i ' m saying is if you need somebody to help you , i ' m happy to keep your boy warm for you .
you ever fought before ?
when we fall , we fall hard .
amazing .
not for lack of love , i can tell ya that .
thats what i mean . always looked like you was just knocked out in love . was real nice to see .
we ' ve touched on this , his own witness has said .
. almost nine minutes . causing brain damage .
she must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long .
hey , <person> .
i can ' t . i ' m working for the federal government .
all the more reason . sort of late for the mail , isn ' t it ?
well , shit , you ' re the cop , they don ' t teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you weren ' t supposed to kill her for <person> ' s sake .
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little <person> to death with a wine bottle ? <person> , man . it couldn ' t have worked out better . they ' re convinced <person> whacked <person> . i can ' t talk ' em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better .
and wasn ' t it awful the way they kept bothering us for american cigarettes ? why , i must have taught fifty girls how to smoke .
for a month ' s pay all we got was <number> million lira .
did i say that ?
it was an accident ! right ?
uh huh . <person> here in river city .
you ' re kidding .
dean <person> ' s , sir .

just the <number> .
did your guy tell you what you needed to know ?
<person> .
what ?
nothing . i ' m just tired .
you want to smoke some pot ?
i want to intercept cell phone calls , digital and analog . and locate the source of the call . i need databasing capability , to cross-reference calls and numbers .
your cellular secretary , friend across all the digital wireless spread spectrum . so , francisco , what do you do ? you a pi ? private security ?
uh-huh .
what ' s she doing now ?
that ' s why we got adjusters .
you got a problem with me going ?
yes . i know .
and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
did she believe you ?
i have no idea .
i see you ' re in your natural element , <person> : a room filled with lethal power . . with a toxic core at its center .
do come in mr . <person> , sidney . you ' re just in time for a nuclear meltdown !
he wants to know who you are . your name . i told him we don ' t need to know anything about you .
<person> . john <person>
do your knees feel as weak as water ?
never .
<person> .
i ' m finished at three . no . <person> with <person> .
you ' re joking , right ?
now that i ' ve given you the overview , we ' re going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail .
how ' re you doing ? you all right ?
i . yeah , i ' m okay . nothing broken . what about you ?
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
you don ' t believe that . i mean . the guy ' s an idiot , a moron , a complete fool . but he ' d never kill anyone . i know the guy . <continued_utterance> thanks , doll .
no . this time i ' m in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , <person> . i ' m going to turn it around . you ' re getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you ' re costing me to buy back the stock , i could modernize the plant . i ' m not the only one who pays here <person> . we ' re talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers .
you must be wearing a mask you ' re laughing so hard behind it <person> . <person> ' s cut the `` sir '' crap . correct me if i ' m wrong , but when you took cnx electronics , you laid off <number> , <number> workers , <person> about <number> , <number> , that airline .
<person> , not dangerous . he was distraught when he found out that you ' d taken all of our research . it was years of his life , gone ! he got depressed , started drinking , and . well , you know the rest .
uh-huh . you mind if we take a moment to verify his identity ?
restaurant . let them know we ' re running late .
five minutes ? <continued_utterance> you ' re not at the center .
the bailiff swearing in kathy .
. whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
i ' m not bouncing at a club .
what do you mean you ' re not bouncing ? <continued_utterance> you ' ve been lying to me ?
<person> ' t jerk me off . we all know what this is . you don ' t work with me if i work with you without knowing who i ' m working for . now let ' s cut the shit . who ' s the man ?
i work for <person> .
it was last year . we were having troubles .
so you fucked a student ? !
solved the whiteman case with this .
that ' s what i heard .
there is no expert on this subject , no wise old man .
the thing is , <person> ' s right . <person> alone won ' t accomplish anything .
i don ' t know . i ' m sort of at a critical . . . juncture .
i thought you were tinkering .
yeah . well , as <person> once said -- ' sex and golf are the only two things you can be bad at and still enjoy . '
let ' s take a mulligan and tee it up again --
i ' m saying it ' s luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he ' s paid the dues , he ' s ready , does all the market research , picks his shot -- `` <person> . ``
pup corn ?
<person> quiet , hasn ' t it ?
yes .
well be alright , peanut , long as weve got room to move .
whats that ?
<person> , wow . i was afraid you left . i was afraid i ' d never see you again .
i ' m not going anywhere , ted . you ' re the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
su hija , su hija ! your daughter from los angeles .
hi , baby ! how are you ? has grandmother spoiled you silly by now ? she has ? good . yes , i got your letter with the picture of your new boyfriend . he ' s very good looking . but he ' s a bit old , isn ' t he ? no ? just how old is he ? .
long enough , lets face it , you were right . everybody was right .
about what ?
nah . <person> called me . he ' s starting up a new fund out here in may so i ' m gon na wait for that .
that guy ' s starting another fund ?
especially in this light . this is the only light they had then , so i like to study it this way . i love this place . i love all ruins .
is that why you got into this business ?
what ' s the assignment ?
you ' re going to put your theories to practice . i ' m sending you into the field .
i can feel your stomach rumbling .
i know . god , i ' d give anything for some of those <person> ' s crackers right now .
yes .
<person> ! its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head . right toward the bridge of the nose . lots and lots of irreparable damage .
<person> ' s happy because he wants to be state attorney general and his most likely opponent will be welles <person> . <person> ' s happy because <person> , who ' s leading their city council race , is endorsed by <person> . thus , they ' re not seeing the larger play . <person> ' s new target will likely be the lapd itself .
how do you know that ?
i hope you wasn ' t pettin ' him none , was you ?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?
a spy . ?
yes .
no ?
no . first , because i don ' t think it ' s in your nature . and second , because there ' s no gold down there .
for a moment there you just reminded me of somebody . <continued_utterance> he had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he ' d completely avoided the truth . his entire life was wrapped up in deception . he told so many lies , i wouldn ' t believe him even if he finally did tell the truth .
he doesn ' t sound like much of a friend .
you mean there ' s something you haven ' t asked me ?
you ' ve already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped <person> <number> . <number> and you ' ve got his module . you ' re free to go right now . why are you going to do this ?
so you think <person> will come after you for the sanderline thing ? he seems like a real hard charger .
i heard he was coming after both of us .
that may be why <person> ' s introducing this guy . we ' ve been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .
that may be what they want us to think .
can you even dye my eyes to match my gown ?
uh-huh .
<person>by , please !
mom , i ' m sorry ! all i wanted to do was talk . i ' ll go .
<person> . so is that a yes or a no ?
i think i was very clear , ted . if everything else falls apart , maybe .
<person> isn ' t so hard to fathom . what ' s clever is getting someone else to pay for it .
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
i ' m going inside .
i ' ve got a thousand days . a thousand days sober today .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
well , i was down at base this morning . car ' s gone now .
something don ' t feel right here , <person> . between you and ida .
but . ? <continued_utterance> at least take my pistol . <continued_utterance> i ' ll never forget you .
go !
most of the time he is , <person> . some of the time he isn ' t . now what do we have here ? <continued_utterance> looks like . our old friend mr . <person> . that should take the pinch out of my ankle . have one .
no thanks . i ' m fine without them .
no .
you leave me no alternative . <continued_utterance> cut her anchor .
heandiacute ; s busy right now .
i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town .
you sure ?
thought of the day is -- `be humble . '
at least i wouldn ' t be pulling the trigger .
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we ' re so close , the town is going to be ours . <person> ' t throw away your future <person> !
maybe she ' ll change her mind . women do . she might give you a second chance .
i suppose that ' s a possibility . that ' s what i tell my statistics class anyway ; life is a game of chance . endless possibilities and permutations . you just have to calculate the odds .
you tell on me , i tell on you .

you are the one , <person> . you sure are .
how long have you known ?
since i tried hiking back to the gas station . you were right , i never got anywhere near it . i
i ' m sure there are excesses and repetitions here , but i believe in the gathering of knowledge and i figured , well , there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices -- and that you ' d help me sort through it . <continued_utterance> i have dozens of golf videotapes , too . and a golf watch .
take it off . all of it . now ! you ' re a smart woman , for chrissakes -- don ' t you know the work of charlatans when you see it ?
we have to get going .
i am not flexible on this .
are we supposed to ?
it ' s not a question of supposed to , it ' s an entirely personal decision . some do some don ' t .
-sometimes when people are sick or hurt for a long time , like <person> , they ' re mind gets hurt too . <continued_utterance> -they start to think things that aren ' t true . he hold me what he thought about your father . it isn ' t true . jeremy -i ' ll show you .
-you know the story about the kid who almost drowned in the pool ? <continued_utterance> -that was me they were talking about . i almost died . that was me . jeremy -you ' re lying . <continued_utterance> -i ' m not . i just didn ' t connect it .
<person> again .
<person> , i admit it was brief , but it was definitely love . crushes don ' t last twelve years .
would you like to stay the night , <person> ? we can reminisce of our departed .
oh , my . a kind offer , but i really must .
in case you ' ve forgotten . i ' m dead already .
<person> ' t you heard the news ? so is she .

oh , no , no , no . <person> , look ! an alien !
where ? <person> falls for the trick and turns around .
from the beastie boys collection ?
it ' s a stakeout suit . it ' s got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it ' s all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .

so let me ask you something , <person> . how good are you ?
i ' m pretty good .
seventy-five percent .
seventy-five percent ? that ' s not nearly good enough for me . i ' m extremely skeptical .
can you give me a clue ? it could be a water heater for all i know .
do you know why you have been brought here ?
remember when you thought <person> might be the unabomber ?
that was different .
<person> , must be about that .
i ' ve been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes for better luck . ya know what i mean ? i mean , maybe the two of us ain ' t the right combination .
i quit now that i ' m wrestling
oh . <person> . ok .
maybe he ' s in mexico , but today he was in new york . the most brilliant and reclusive novelist in the history of the world is here , in this neighborhood . he may be living on this very block .
where did you see him ?
i don ' t know . we got ta get ' im outta here before skipper sees him like this .
<person> of a bitch ! !

it ' s the most despicable thing i ' ve ever heard in my life . i mean , it ' s disgusting . guys shooting pool to determine my future .
<person> , i had no choice ! hand me the toast .
i know it ' s busted . what did i just tell you ?
well , you know so much why don ' t you just fix it yourself ?
exactly . the trick is , you got ta pick your target . they have to be nice little housewife types . school-teachers . but , i ' m telling you , you get their pilot lit , these babes , they can suck- start a leaf-blower .
what about the husbands ?
it was good of you to meet .
thank you for coming .
no no no , tucker , thank you .

you don ' t know the first thing about being someone ' s friend --
i don ' t want to be just your friend --
-- what are you going on about ?
i can judge too .
under a hundred .
you want to stick around here , <person> ?
can i ask you where you were the night <person> was murdered ?
you can tell j . <person> that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin ' witnesses .

<person> ' t you fall apart on me . <person> , thelma . every time we get in trouble , you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit , and this time . not this time . everything ' s changed now . now you can do whatever you want , but i ' m going to mexico . i ' m going . are you coming with me ?
i ' m sort of helping him work through some issues .
<person> ' t he lucky .
by monday i promise . i have a paper due friday . now what ' s going on ? i ' m just going to stand here till you tell me .
is it infidelity if you ' re involved with someone on e-mail ?
the broom ! <continued_utterance> may we have it ?
please ! and take it with you !
next thing you ' ll be using twinkle lights .
twinkle lights ?
it ' s a goddamn bunion . it ' ll heal .
oh . i thought that ' s not it anyway . i know this doesn ' t make any sense to you , but i just can ' t turn it off that fast . i still feel something for her .
<person> . <person> .
and if no one comes to get them by night-time , then they belong to me .
<person> , mr . <person> .
then you ' d better call me <person> .
i flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful .
you know what would be really useful ? do you still have that friend at ligo ?
no , i asked . just the yelling .
she didn ' t hear barking . so they were either lousy guard dogs . or they knew the killer . you can ' t hit something this clean unless you ' re point blank . he could ' ve been petting them when he fired : look at the burn pattern- like when you shoot something with a silencer .
what about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job ?
you know about that ? <continued_utterance> <person> , it ' s quicker . <continued_utterance> you don ' t have any pictures though , do ya . <person> ?
they don ' t call them lovers in high school , leland .
<person> didn ' t give you this ?
that ' s every man within a five mile radius . including you . that ' s why you ' re here , isn ' t it ? you think i can ' t do it . you think i ' m going to screw up . or get myself killed .
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone . especially king ' s daughter .
i know .
i can ' t believe this is happening .
he does have the occasional tendency towards self-destruction it seems .
it ain ' t occasional and it ain ' t no tendency -- it ' s a fact of life that he gon na blow sky high , it ' s just a matter of when and how fast can the pieces be put back together . <person> that twinkle in his eyes is nitroglycerin .
the only thing taken was him . <person> is on-scene . get over there right now .
why me ?
we can do it right here .
<person> .
who was that girl you were with ?
there was a girl ?
ok . so i have to ask , those tatoo ' s must have hurt , right ?
not really .
i wish there was more to read . <person> few things being written about any of this . to think of someone like fred . locked away . his mind and heart so vibrant .
it ' s a waste . an awful waste .
were you always this sick ?
one thing for sure , <person> ain ' t lookin that good naked .
no . we ' re not , <person> . i ' m gon na help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town .
i don ' t need a new place . i have a house . i ' m not fancy that way .
it ' s tuesday , near nine .
nine ? are you sure ?
he ' s a writer - sort of . he writes advertising copy .
really ? <person> , i suggest we look at your father ' s firing as a blessing in disguise .
they ' re okay . what ' s that bald spot on <person> ' s head ? ugh .
some sort of infection .
no .
friday ?
no it won ' t . warm milk won ' t do it .
whatever you ' ve got on your mind isn ' t worth staying awake for .
accept your body ' s resistance .
yes .
i dunno , <person> . i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare .
well it ' s working . what am i gon na do , <person> ? i ' m obsessed . i think about <person> so much my balls ache .
he also said `` listen to the water . ``
<person> to the water . <person> to the owl . he also said , don ' t trust the fucking <person> .
standard equipment . the world ' s automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders .
i must say , q , you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement .
lay off pittsburgh . it ' s one of the great cities .
if it can produce a miss sloviak you ' ll get no argument from me .
not tonight .
' not tonight ' means maybe some other night ?
all prop cars accounted for ?
he has to be on foot . he has the world ' s most recognizable face . he can ' t disappear .
he saw an owl .
so what ?
i ' d be happy to tell you . <continued_utterance> we know what you ' re up to , <person> , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead body you ain ' t gon na break up bluestar .
you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it ' s the first i ' ve heard of it .
hi . how are you doing ? she nods , happy to be working with the child . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been meaning to come in a long time .
you live in the neighborhood ?
why ?
he just never struck me as the marrying type , that ' s all .
this is a joke .
<person> . i ' m not going to lie to you . i liked the way you looked . but if you don ' t pull it together , i ' ll forget the other guy . you know that . other guy - you ?
it ' s so nice to have friends like you , <person> .
what is it , <person> ? your balls need scratching ?
what ?
it was the police . they have <person> .
i don ' t know , sir . we got massive energy readings out of nowhere , then they just disappeared .
<person> ' s go take a look .
we ' re a thousand miles from anybody else , man . it ' s going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better .
well , stick to it .
what ? no ' . there ' s no one here . i ' m just . just .
just what ? doing a little dusting ?
<person> ? what are you doing here ? everyone and their mother ' s mother is looking for you .
they have me soon enough . where are you going ?
the wet becomes you . <person> rid of some of the slickness .
i don ' t like the idea that i ' m not in control of this , but if this stuff ' s got to happen , i guess i ' ve got no choice . i wan na . ya know . . i wan na be with ya ! <person> , i said that . i said it , okay ? ! i wan na be with ya ! it pisses the hell out of me , and i ' m gon na tell you that to your face , but i want to be with you because . i miss you and i ' d like to live with you . i ' d like to marry you . and that ' s that !
we offer him rewards .
what if that doesn ' t work ?
but it wasn ' t meant to be .
why not ?
what if he doesn ' t ?
i ' ll take the horse on the day he fails .
estoy desemperado !
she ' s lonely !
your outfit ? i ' m next in line .
you ain ' t got enough in your britches . think you can prove <person> , go ahead . <continued_utterance> anybody else ? no takers . <person> turns back to business : <continued_utterance> all right . billy , go after <person> and cool him off then go find the mclaurys , tell ' em what happened and keep an eye on things . wes <person> and <person> , too . rest of you come with me . we ' re goin ' to mexico .
who ' s she ?
<person> .
uh huh . and what do you --
i mean i took him to play pool ! it was a little clandestine thing we did for fun ! it wasn ' t like a big secret , i mean who cares ? i was actually trying to be nice to him . but he ' s so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin ' squeal on me and i have to listen to your fuckin ' shit all day when i didn ' t even fuckin ' do anything !
my ritual will kill the prophecy ! now the child dies with it , its en- ergy exiled into oblivion ! you see ? i hold the power of the universe !
not until your ritual is complete !
oh sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap ? ! i ' ll be back just as soon as i can . ok ? i am not the kind of man that everyone says i am .
i know you ' re not .
he had polio . probably still contagious .
<person> ' t dismiss me because i sit in this chair !
i ' ve read official estimates but i wouldn ' t bet my house on them . i ' ve heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers . at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who don ' t give a damn if they ' re caught or not .
what do you look for ?
<person> has a flare for the dramatic . the former pittsburgh steeler running back , beat known for `` the immaculate reception , '' his improbable sixty yard <person> . i say <person> has made a bold move on corporate america . <person> has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the <person> sausage company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting <person> ' s , <person> is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .
easy <person> .
cuz i want new york .
<person> . they sent us out here because the place was being neglected . now , all of a sudden , there ' s two five man swat teams out there tonight . bell huey choppers flying all over the place . federal occupation to catch one guy . why , <person> ? what ' s going on ?
why ? why ? she ' s dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?
we have to call the ambulance .
how tough you have to be to make the army ? all you ' ve got to do is shoot a gun , and stop a bullet .
<person> at him . we ought to just leave him behind . <continued_utterance> like he said : people get lost in wars all the time . and out here ? out here there are eight million ways to die .
not priority . right now . why ?
well . money ' s tight and .
stop .
<person> !
yeah . i ' ve been getting out here a bit more often .
you got ta be kidding me .
no ! he just needs par to tie ! tell him to lay up ! he listens to you !
go for it , <person> ! knock it on !
up goes the jib and out roll tod-o and the mayor ' s daughter , naked as pilot whales .
i don ' t know who was more surprised , you or big daddy .
doctors . their power is in jargon . so you study up . <continued_utterance> is that the procedure for all bilateral periorbital hematomas in a lefort iii fracture of a comatose patient ?
in a lefort iii - absolutely . the potential for sub-cranial brain damage was too great .
i couldn ' t it was <person> ' s birthday . i promised i ' d be with him . i told you not to call me here .
a little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something i am certainly willing to put up with .
not a lot of difference .
what do you mean ? bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -
sweetheart --
no ! not sweetheart , no . i believe in what ' s happening . i don ' t want to , but i do . i guess i was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you .
show me .
god , some people are stupid .
what ! ?
mine .
i like to editorialize . you drunk ?
drunk ? only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of fianga as the first army of liberation marched in and opened fire .
no . your dad specifically said <person> and <person> were evil .
<person> , whatever . if i show you how to get there , will you buy me a bottle of wine ?
<person> , woods are metal -- don ' t worry about it -- and the driver ' s known as the big dog and i ' m just saying to turn him loose , let ' er rip , let the big dog eat !
oh . <continued_utterance> this is , without a doubt , the stupidest , silliest , most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented .
who , nora ?
yeah , yeah . who else is it gon na be . ' who , nora '' ! . who else is there ? the whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me . it ' s one thing when they ' re with you for a night , but when they live with ya , it ' s stretching the point . they got a lot of things they bring with them . you go to the bathroom you see ' things ' you never saw before .
<person> saturday night we ' ll have a party . invite all our friends , sit out on the veranda and interview each other .
i ' ve done all that .
no .
<person> ' t you a little worried about her . ?
<person> ' s still coming to see me today , right ?
yeah . of course . after school .
<person> , `` dude '' .
what ' s the deal ?
we need something : a flare , a signal mirror .
no .
<person> ?
i ' m sorry about all that . i just-i don ' t like to talk about my family . they treat me like a freak .
its core ?
<person> knew how to make the light bulb . he had the energy source . he had the vacuum . but he didnandiacute ; t have the filament . he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power .
i ' m from minneapolis . <person> . i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res . so i know about the other world , <person> . <continued_utterance> are you gon na keep that medicine bundle or are you gon na respect its power ? <continued_utterance> thank you .
when you see <person> , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in . the sooner we back off this reservation . <person> ?
yes , we know that you do . i have it in my files . that ' s at the manhattan health center .
no . at chelsea childcare . <person> . <person> , call me monday , hey ? i ' m late for work .
i don ' t know how to drive .
i ' ll teach you .
i don ' t give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there ' s only one way to do that .
are you sure ? . about me , i mean ?
<number> , fort washington golf club , fresno , california , final round of the tour qualifying school .
i was playing to win .
the eighteenth ?
there ' s a two week waiting period in this state .
fine . <person> . <continued_utterance> you were right . it ' s nothin ' like i thought . i almost wish .
i know , kid . i know . me too .
that ' s what you ' ve been looking for -- a farter ?
i ' ve been looking for a
i didn ' t say there was . could i please -- could i please -- may i respond ?
no , that ' s really all i have to --
im sorry , <person>or . i just cant help it . give me a minute and <person> quit .
<person> frightened , <person> . this aint no good .
<person> .
you said to shoot the wad .
<person> ?
chaperone . i ' m waiting for my dinner date .
. they start again three minutes earlier .
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes . we were trying to restore her .
<number> i ' ve heard that she ' s very sensitive . <continued_utterance> what are they doing ?
it ' s the new <person> theme song . we thought this would be a good way to launch it . everybody who plays existenz is going to be very familiar with that tune .
<person> didn ' t wash her hands before dinner . and look at this . <continued_utterance> oh , is this from a lover ? <person> has no response . leland did you get this from your lover ?
they don ' t call them lovers in high school , leland .
oh yeah .
<person> .
i was the one who brought that money in .
i ' m well aware of your stake in this,
i guess . i ' ve got an ego same as any man .
<person> , ' cause i liked what i saw .
<person> came to me . he told me he ' d fire <person> if i didn ' t do it . i went along with him for <person> ' s sake . it was only pattycake , after all .
so altruistic .
so far you ' re great . you got a cigarette ?
what are you drinking ? <person> . ?
what time is it , <person> ?
oh . <continued_utterance> agent desmond , it ' s .
he ' s my roommate .
oh , i see , i see .
gone fishing .
fishing ?
<person> .
i have to go .
then you ' re saying the book ' s wrong ?
better that than <person> .
yeah .
well , she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that i could tell . what you make of that ?
you know , choo choo . goes on tracks . wo woo .
oh no !
it ' s hard because i ' m a complete stranger and what we ' re talking about is incredibly personal . besides , the first time most people come here , a part of them is wondering if i ' m gon na think they ' re crazy . she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry , i ' m required to have at least three sessions in order to commit . <continued_utterance> now that ' s a joke . <continued_utterance> i have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life , one of which you may or may not be experiencing . if you want to get some stuff off your chest , great . if not .
these are good .
<person> ? kill him ? . how ?
thats your business . i dont care how .
who is us ?
<person> erasure is what they use on agents . go away .
like in a church painting . i see this giant hovering over the ground . he ' s wearing a robe , and has long flowing hair , and he ' s pointing his finger at something .
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do ?
the right man ? talk to me , <person> .
<person> dusted <person> , dusted him from the driver ' s seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands . <person> looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car . it ' s a known fact out here that he ' s petrified of driving . his parents were killed in a car wreck .
i thought you might want to see a friendly face . so how ' s our boy doing ?
well , he ' s enjoying the waters very much . he . i think we ' ve lost him .
it ' s an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it ' s based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they ' ve done something wrong . or the level of what they ' ve done wrong .
the guy might not have been carrying anything .
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , <person> had only one successful business .
sure . <continued_utterance> you want an umbrella with that ?
nah . i ' m good . but keep these coming . <person> checks a ticket and prepares two drinks . <continued_utterance> so how you doing , pal ?
<person> ' t much look like you were hanging drapes .
i swear to you that ' s all that happened . i haven ' t so much as set foot in your bedroom .
i pay my own way .
since when ?
so youre gon na be needin the blue-bird pretty soon ?
real soon . <person> be makin the swap tomorrow , and thanks again , beany .
no . there ' s no way . i mean , don ' t you think there ' s no way ?
well , no , i don ' t see any way .
i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry , <person> , i ' m really sorry . ! <continued_utterance> <person> .
what ?
what ' s this for ?
for dana , schmuck . bring your kid something . you know . the dad thing .
and you say he ' s getting serious already ?
yes , i think . he keeps talking about marriage , keeps saying he wants to meet <person> .
well , call him back . tell him you ' ll come later .
there ' s no way . i can ' t , he ' s suicidal . why don ' t you call <person> and tell him you ' ll be there in a few hours .
i ' ve heard that name before . are you a gascon ?
yes , <person> .
or what ?
the boy goes away .
now you ' re gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . now i ' m gon na take the whole foot off . <person> think of that ? <continued_utterance> what ' s that , eh ? i thought you didn ' t have no friends !
keys . you got ' em ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' em to me . <continued_utterance> i hope you ' re getting paid extra for this .
go !
watch the guy with the basket ! <person> <number> leaps out of the car , gun in hand .
because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
this isn ' t about you , <person> . they ' re doing this to me .
is that it ?
no . my client would like to talk to you .
she ' s that subtle ?
<person> ' s claws and a bear ' s balls that ' s what her profile says .
he is the brother of my late husband , <person> de winter . he blames me for de winter ' s death .
did you murder your husband , <person> ?
yeah , right .
why not ?
what just happened ?
i just had my car jumped on .
she came here . we ' ll just wait . in the meantime , i need you to shimmy through . <continued_utterance> relax . <person> hasn ' t carried a house key since she was twelve years old . and your hips are as slim as hers .
it ' s not that . it just reminded me of -- you know-of what ' s in the car . in the trunk .
<person> ' s so uncool . so boring .
you liked him well enough last night . ' oh , <person> , i just love my rifle so much ! it ' s the bestest present ever ! '
<person> , we don ' t sell horses . just dogs , cats , birds .
then give me one of those , large enough to ride . the pet store clerk looks confused .
how come you didn ' t ask <person> to help you ?
he said he was busy . he is mad ' cause he wanted to get in the garage to get his things so he could go with <person> .
it ' s no my fault i was born first . besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .
it ' s not a vacation , it ' s private school .
<person> ? all by yourself ?
yeah .
i ' ll bet you a thousand dollars against my car that i can beat you in any game -- any game , you name it -- with a seven iron .
this is ridiculous .
please believe me . it was just a kiss for old time ' s sake . i ' ve had a stupid crush on her since i was seven , but i never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me , completely naked .
<person> naked is no big deal . it has nothing to do with emotion , nothing to do with love . you can be around all the naked girls you want and you won ' t be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life . <continued_utterance> see that ? you don ' t know me even one ounce better than you did before . you and your stupid magazine . i liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human , like the rest of us .
buzzing ?
<person> . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .
<person> .
it means setting small , reasonable goals for yourself . one day at a time , one tiny step at a time -- do- able , accomplishable goals .
i think there ' s something nice about a picnic . it ' s fun .
what ' s fun about it ? ants get into the food . there ' s bees . i don ' t get it . we have to drive , it takes maybe an hour to get there , then you sit in grass and eat . why is that fun ?
really ? how screwed ? like i knew it was a rule but i ' m a little fuzzy on the exact details .
you ' re cursed , man , and if you stay here then we ' ll all be cursed . you have to leave .
nice try , <person> .
<person> -- listen to me . it ' s in the coke machine . you ' ve got about fourteen minutes to get this building evacuated .
and i ' m talking about enjoying myself .
you know , you sound just like a boy who ' s never --
some of our extras haven ' t had a vegetable since <person> .
attack of the atomic vampires .
testing one two three four .

your ideas never work out .
oh really ? starbucks ?
<person> . the staten island ferry .
i want to go to the storybook lady .

<person> . what are you wearing ?
my god , i am going to have another breakdown . god , god .
i thought we might get some coffee . can i buy you -- ?
i don ' t think so .

i don ' t work in toontown .
an hour ?
i told the innkeeper to bring them when they are dry . <person> then , i ' m afraid you are my prisoner . would the prisoner care for a drink ?
muthafucker -- there is a god .
heartbreaker , huh ? you let him gig here last night ?
i was there .
<person> --
how are your hands ?
starting to burn .
i know .
y ' see ? that ' s the real point here . that ' s what i ' m driving for , when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave ' s are bare . what ' s left ? the little trees , the little fellas that the storm didn ' t see . the tiny little .
it ' s too bad you don ' t live down here , ted .
<person> ?
patronizing son-of-a-bitch ! i wanted to walk again .
and you still might . this report legitimizes we ' ve worked so hard for . we can raise funs now . it could change everything !
if you ' d like to tell me .
two weeks ago she left me . for the owner of a pizza parlor .
actually , <person> , i don ' t know .
<person> , if this is a dysfunctional --
madmartigan ! what did you do this time ?

<person> knocked me out .

i am not your brother . i never was .
then what ? <continued_utterance> gunther , it will be fine . and when all the machines break down and they call up the horses , i ' ll see you at the front . we ' ll be together again . <continued_utterance> gunther .
i ' m giving this to you . for luck . <continued_utterance> to keep you safe .
why not ?
you think she ' d go through with it ? guess i always thought they ' d adopt .
because you ' re an alien . you don ' t belong in concrete any more than i do . this place would like to kill us because we ' re different .
oh , come on , <person> . that ' s a little dramatic .
what ?
i was there .
bitch . <person> ' s band .
<person> ' s band ?
where does he live ?
you mind telling me why you ' re looking for him first ?
this time ' ll be different . i promise .
i don ' t know , man . <person> now you don ' t even got the money to get your clubs out of hock .
this is easy money , pardner . no ones gon na get hurt in this thing . and i dont think you can afford not to take it . <person> be bringin the eldo round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin . if you aint a pussy - youll be there .
i dont particularly care for that kind of talk , <person> .

i mean i ' m a fucking fraud . i ' m no architect . <person> ' t be a putz -- who ' s been to santiago twice in a year ? <continued_utterance> i knew shit . the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else . my real name ' s norm . i deliver pizzas .
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed .
there was .
well . i always figured i ' d get it in toontown .
i think i got him .
it ' s okay . he is an asshole . most of the time i just let it slide .
<person> slow down . that ' s a cop . <continued_utterance> maybe you got a few too many parking tickets ?
<person> . whats happenin here ?
hey . stop the nervous cry-baby routine . youre my girl now . <person> is gon na wipe away those tears and make you happy . come on , lets get outta here .
well , it wasn ' t black yet .
but it was all puffed up ? then it was a shiner .
leave it if you don ' t know what it ' s for .
a pot is a pot . we ' ll find some use for it . <person> , where ' s the livestock ?
how much ?
close to two million . but this sucker can go all the way to <person> and the nationals .
that ' s a great sign . it means your nervous system is fully engaging with the game architecture . the game is a lot more fun when it starts to feel realer than real .
yeah . <continued_utterance> existenz is paused !

testing one two three four .
what are you doing here ?
i heard you were sick and i was worried and i wanted to -- is someone here ?
the thing is , <person> ' s right . <person> alone won ' t accomplish anything .
then let ' s bomb the shit out of them . everyone wants to , even you , even me . it sure would feel good .
what do you mean to do ?
this checkmate goes to you . i didnandiacute ; t want to hurt anyone . but you leave me no choice .
where ' d you come up with this stuff , anyway ?
i net a guy in a bar .
they won ' t be ready for at least an hour .

what ? how do you know about my father ?
i won ' t .
hey -- i ' m not kidding , <person> .
no ! what gave you that idea ?
relax , <person> . i ' m not her father . i just rent her a room .

do you take cocaine , <person> ?
no , i do not . i never took cocaine or any other drugs . i don ' t take drugs .
you bet . <person> .
<person> .
right . full of shit .
then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle . works like a charm : her ass will be white as snow in three hours .
<person> . <person> . de-nail ain ' t just a river in egypt . she ' s probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion .
will you just open the door !
creditors are gettin ' cranky .
the operative word was good .

i vandalized <person> ' s trailer and she found my picture of lacey .
we ' re not going to do anything .
they ' re going to kill us !
why ? what ' s his problem ?
he ' s a great chef .
but you made a pretty good speech to me yesterday about people sticking to their commitments .
yeah . ?
in what sense ?
in the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda '' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
<person> ' t worry , <person> , no one knows i ' m here .

put out the fire .
huh . <person> , yeah , it is sorta .
they use a laser .

what are the colors ?
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they ' ve got a of nerve agent they ' re gon na unleash .

why would i think that ? just because you couldn ' t take your eyes off her --
i ' m just using her , <person> ! it ' s part of my plan . i ' m going to get you all out of here as soon as i can .
what about these low-level flights ? they ' re starting in what ? an hour ? do you realize what you ' re letting yourself in for ?
we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them .
it ' s really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .

it ' s my job to risk my life , but not yours . i feel bad about bringing you into this , but you ' re the only one i can trust .
where were you ? on a . uh , mission ?
and they say romance is dead . timber falls it is . <continued_utterance> who ' s <person> and/or <person> ?
you really were stoned through high school . as <person> and sheryl trek up the path .
<person> scared , mama .
why , honey ?
. and there ' s no truth that <number> % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?
no sir ! i swear ! this is not true ! !
. you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . <person> ' t that what you did ?
yes .
i don ' t know how to fish , <person> .

<person> came to the play .
you saw him ?
sticks and stones . it doesn ' t bother me if you sleep on the couch from now on .
does it bother you that you ' re a selfish , uptight , boring lover ?
come on , <person> , we could have a great week up in vermont .
i see what you mean . but wednesday we ' ve got to be back in new york .
what ? tell me .
they ' ve announced the possibility that <person> will delay the release of your new system indefinitely , until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is . i don ' t approve , myself . i don ' t think we should bend one degree to extremists .
<person> .
i know . in riverside park .
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
you called the cops on us ?
exactly . just as you ' re sworn to obey me now . yes ?
yes .
a lot of good times , but i can ' t live off the good times . you know , my brother-in-law has offered me a job at hess shoes . i think maybe i should do it . you get there in the morning , you come home at night . you get health benefits . i get to be assistant manager .
that ' s it , <person> ? you ' re gon na spend the day measuring people ' s feet ? ' you ' re an `` e '' fit . you ' re a `` d '' wide . you got a high arch . i ' ll show you something in an alligator . something with a wing tip . ' how can you talk about that all day long ? <person> , you ' re the best tin man there ever was . <person> ' s a better closer .
no !
you want to come on in ?
i couldn ' t help myself ! <person> was just staring at me with those pouty eyes -- and those perky breasts -- opposable thumbs . and how about the name ? `` the tree of the knowledge of good and <person> '' ? you don ' t think that sounds tempting ? they should ' ve just called it `` the tree with the fruit that <person> . `` then for sure nobody would eat it .
i think , and i could be wrong , that all the poop makes the ground more fertile , which in turn , gives the leaves in the area a softer feel . it ' s a vicious circle .
how did you find out about the toxin ?
sid <number> . <number> told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .
a gift from mr . <person> gentlemen . he turns and walks out of the room .
<person> . open them .
that ' s the trouble . i can ' t make up my mind . i haven ' t got a brain -- only straw .
how can you talk if you haven ' t got a . mcu -- scarecrow speaks to dorothy o . s . in f . g . -- dorothy o . s . . brain ?
hurts me to be the one to tell you .
i ' m sure it does .
this is good work , x , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this `` ahab '' .
hey , one miracle at a time . they ' re on to me now , remember ?
what ' s complicated about it ? she doesn ' t give a shit about <person> . they hate each other . you can ' t let her take him .
ok . ok . <person> , just go get ready for practice and i ' ll deal with it .
mr . president , our pilots are in danger . we must order punitive airstrikes against the sam site that shot down <person> per our rules of engagement .

but wait . you ' re rich and women love you and i ' m from ohio and i ' m drunk . can i tell you the truth ?
everyone does .
come after me . time traveller i did it to save your life , young lady , which i ' m afraid doesn ' t hold much meaning for you or anyone else . the girl it doesn ' t .
must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown . not one of them so much as lifted a finger . - a curious attitude - in a curious world . <person> ' t you the least bit interested in what i am . where i come from ? the girl should i be ? time traveller perhaps you ' d better take me to someone a bit older i can talk to .
<person> <number> . insights into my soul .
yes . well . <person> ' t compete with that .
under what pretext ?
any fucking pretext !
oh yeah , i ' m with them .
where ' d you get the coat , brian ? where ' d you get the camera ? how much did they pay you ?
did she say that ? i met her `` once ? '' did she say i met her `` once ? '' brian looks away . he ' s said too much .
cut it out . i miss the old you . we all miss the old you . because the new guy is shit . <continued_utterance> oh . man . <person> . that came out wrong . i love you - period . how ' s your arm , man ? <person> shakes his head , moves toward the bar .
i see a pattern . every time something terrible can happen to me , it does .
<person> , but why ? why ' d the cougar go for you and not me ? why did you fall and i didn ' t ? <person> to believe it ' s all just random . think about
no .
you ' re not <person> ?
<person>ie , i have some bad news !
okay . i ' m ready . what is it ?
yes , sir . it certainly was a surprise hearing from you . your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine . of course you ' ve got plenty of time to be amusing , sitting on that porch , rocking away , while we put in a full day ' s work . you always were a lucky stiff , and i envy you . a few years more , i was saying to emmy the other evening , and i ' m going to be able to take it easy like old tom .
<person> .
seems like i do but only cause end of the day we ' re all eyes in the same head . and everything is everything .
what ?
now listen to this . he puts his ear to the typewriter .
that whirring ?
<person> ' s <person> -- number four -- <number> bucks .

and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like i ' m <person> of sunnybrook farm .
a little respect would be nice , that ' s all .

if the shoe fits , suck on it .
uh-huh . d-don ' t want to sleep .
why ?
why ? do you object to losing your head ?

it doesn ' t quite add up . <continued_utterance> the infrared satellite images . no heat , no flame , no explosion . if that boat went down where they said it did , there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface .
<person> ?
she was lonely , i talked to her . <person> , i know how it looks , but --
<person> , listen to me . i know you ' re under some strain . but there ' s no such thing as ghosts . they don ' t exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and i . wait , why aren ' t you dressed ?

<person> to stir it around a little ?

i find it hard to eat when so many are hungry .
your concern is enviable .

i just want you to know that ' s why i dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo-faulknerian nobody .
i ' m usually too tired to be .
<person> . it ' s because you ain ' t got the baby batter in your brain any more . that ' ll fuck with your head , that stuff will .
why not ?
because it ' s not true .
make you dizzy , lionel .
a little bit .
you ' re a bank robber ?

<person> -
that ' s right . i agree . <person> .
i ' m happy for him . although -- could i make a little suggestion ? i think you should meet him . no . i take it back .
i hardly think i need advice from someone who --

. i think the whole process would have taken an hour . maybe more . and then i suppose both would have changed back to dog form .
i won ' t appear in uniform !
please , <person> .
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal . you ' ve tried to poison my people ' s hearts against me with your manipulation , with letters i never wrote . you ' ve been watching me eat , work , raise my family . wash myself in the river . and now you ' re here , arresting me at a sacred place . in your eyes , that ' s power . <continued_utterance> so i plant this tree for you . and i take all this stuff that you ' ve laid on me and my people , and i put it in this hole with this pine cone . and i bury it . cuz ya know what it is , <person> ? bullshit . and shit is fertilizer . and the mother will turn your lies into something that lives . <continued_utterance> that ' s what power is , in the indian way . <person> me to rapid , <person> . i ' m the enemy .
if i told you . that i think <person> ' s innocent . but i ' m in over my head . would you believe me ?
no . put the casket down .
what am i ?
oh , dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable . <person> ' t you get down ?
down ? no , you see , i ' m -- well , -- i ' m --
<person> --
goodbye <person> .
why would they blame us ?
because when they find him and his head is all bashed in , they ' re going to start pointing fingers , and you guys are drifters , so they ' ll put two and two together and that makes -- he stares expectantly at zed and oh . cain four ! it makes four ! now stop asking so many questions and hop on . we got ta get out of here !
nope .
<person> ?
ya know . `` it '' .
that ' s like wondering if your mom and dad do it . who wants to know ?

you don ' t say !
not until your ritual is complete !
and who will stop me ? the elements are slaves to my command !

i can ' t be sure .
<person> ' t worry . he found the chocolate room .

what kind of infection ?
i don ' t know .
<person> that . where is your partner ?
vouching in evidence at wilshire station .
an old woman and her grandson .
can you tell me what their names were ?
it ' s a shake-down . he ' s probably partners with the guy who ran us off the road . <person> ' t be surprised if he has a deal with the tow guy , too .
you think this whole thing was a scam ? <person> , he could ' ve killed us !
if we ' ve got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn ' t be in any condition to do anything about it . you play chess ?
i guess i ' ll be learning .
this is miles from the battle lines .
deserters would have run , they wouldn ' t have engaged .
i ' m not taking any chances .
i need your clothes , byers .
looks bearish to me , buddy . you got it all upside down . <person> , i ' m giving this to you and you alone , ' cause i feel sorry for you . <person> the knicks against the bullets , and my pick of the day -- duke to beat the spread against <person> .
<person> , <person> , with that i might be able to qualify for welfare . <continued_utterance> you got a look in your eye , mr . mannheim . you got something for the small fry .

she retained me last week to help sort out her father ' s situation .
you mean <person> ?
that ' s it . <person> start that ball rolling . <continued_utterance> i ' ll be damned . this is funny .

thanks . <person> care -
why did you eat that fruit ? it ' s forbidden . everybody knows that .
i couldn ' t help myself ! <person> was just staring at me with those pouty eyes -- and those perky breasts -- opposable thumbs . and how about the name ? `` the tree of the knowledge of good and <person> '' ? you don ' t think that sounds tempting ? they should ' ve just called it `` the tree with the fruit that <person> . `` then for sure nobody would eat it .
we don ' t have any pictures of rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is , and anybody crazy enough to go after him . <continued_utterance> . is liable to get his nuts shot off . <continued_utterance> <person> , well g ' bye . who the fuck are you ?
hub kittle . i ' m with <person> and <person> -- new york . we have a client down here .
we got to talk .

it so happens i haven ' t been to this restaurant before . i don ' t know how they do their eggs . if they ' re over easy and they ' re gooey , i ' m not happy with it . and i ' m not happy if the soft boiled eggs are left in the shell .

repeating this life . over and over .
even the last twenty-four hours ?

what ' ve i got to lose ? you okay , <person> ?
it ' s a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding .

that bloody impossible lower field the day me and <person> plowed it . best day of my life that was and you were there .
and this here is the worst day of my life , about to begin , and you ' re here cheering me on . us two , always . and him .
there ' s not much of a woman ' s touch around here .

no .
well , she wants to fuck you .
you ' re gon na put yourself through this over and over , for five hundred bucks a pop ?
some of them pay a little more than that . <continued_utterance> i would have had to bounce for a month to make what i made in two hours last night . <continued_utterance> and these guys , they ' re not real fighters . they ' re just guys who have seen too much ufc on tv . if you have a better solution , i ' m all ears .
okay , i know what you ' re thinking , but i ' m just checking it out . we kept hearing that this place was so evil , but now that i look around i ' m thinking maybe it ' s not all bad . there ' s a lot to learn here .
what ? like human sacrifice ?
everyone is breaking up . you . me . this other person i know broke up with someone in an elevator . i think it was in an elevator . or just outside it . or after it . it got stuck . i think . and suddenly everything became clear . when i saw you , at the coffee place , i was waiting for him and i was --
-- charming .
what ?
they ' re screaming for starbursts .
<person> laxative ? we can ' t snort baby laxative .
no shit . we killed a guy for baby laxative .

leland leave her alone . she doesn ' t like that . stop it .
you ' re going to take a year off ?
no .
the whole pod just disappeared into your back .
it disappeared into my back ? ! it . it ' s in my spine ? it ' s winding its way around my spinal cord ?
i don ' t want to listen .
give me a chance to explain . you owe me that much .
he was my father ' s best friend !
he ' s killed closer .
i don ' t know . when you say it , it sounds crazy . but what else could it all be ? jody shakes her head . <continued_utterance> i mean , he ' s so kind of grim and daunting , and she sounded terrified of something . <continued_utterance> <person> to me . i sound like some middle- aged <person> .
know what i think ?
<person> .
oh , well , some people have all the luck . everyone in the family is fine here . <person> had the mumps , which is no joke at eleven years of age -
even the supervisors at bendix don ' t make that .
so how are you ever gon na make enough to drive a ' <person> then , fuck-face ?
tight . but i ' m working on him .
<person> on him .
i desecrated it ?
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal . you ' ve tried to poison my people ' s hearts against me with your manipulation , with letters i never wrote . you ' ve been watching me eat , work , raise my family . wash myself in the river . and now you ' re here , arresting me at a sacred place . in your eyes , that ' s power . <continued_utterance> so i plant this tree for you . and i take all this stuff that you ' ve laid on me and my people , and i put it in this hole with this pine cone . and i bury it . cuz ya know what it is , <person> ? bullshit . and shit is fertilizer . and the mother will turn your lies into something that lives . <continued_utterance> that ' s what power is , in the indian way . <person> me to rapid , <person> . i ' m the enemy .
something like that . do you live around here now ?
<person> and i just bought this divine house in pleasant valley . do you know it ? great for the kids . <continued_utterance> it ' s the first time i ' ve left the doors unlocked since i was a child growing up in the midwest . <person> ' s been promoted to vp of united motors so it ' s all happening for us . but enough of me . how are you ?
<person> wallet . <person> passport . <person> ticket stub , hotel receipt , tasker . two postcards of <person> . house keys . <person> snowing swiss village .

you were shot in the head . the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate .
penetration but not perforation .
<person> , no , it ' s just . you ' re dressed so formally .
oh . no . you know , i just thought i ' d -- you know i thought it was a special occasion . which it is .
<person> ' t .
i would have asked for your phone number and i wouldn ' t have been able to wait <number> hours before calling and asking , `` how about coffee , drinks , dinner , a movie , for as long as we both shall live ? ''
you ' re not coming ?
yeah , i am . i just have to finish toiling over here , then i ' m right behind you .
funny story . you see , me and a buddy of mine decided to . ah . you know . just . drive down .

<person> knew about it . <person> to tell <person> , get the warriors involved .
i ' m not going .
you know what this is , don ' t you ? it ' s a golden opportunity . a springboard for you to run for governor . <continued_utterance> ever hear of a civil war general named <person> ?
well , uh , can you tell us his name ?
jeez , i didn ' t catch it .

i ' m afraid that ' s not true . will you want me to stay on till monday ?
<person> and <person> are checkin ' it every twenty minutes or so .
thanks .
oh , come on , sweetie , give me one of your smiles .
<person> ya , <person> .
what ' s this about ? this is obviously some scam . is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ?
you ' ve misunderstood .
a piazza ?
i was eloquent . <person> . it ' s just inevitable , isn ' t it ? people are going to want to turn her into joan of arc --
my sister said she saw <person> holding hands with some college guy .
i dunno , <person> . i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare .
you ' re stretching our friendship , <person> . if you blow this at all --
you ' ll never hear from me again .
that ' s all right , <person> . <person> ' t worry .
never got to wear one of those .
not a prayer .
i ' m a lifesaver . a lighthouse . up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . i stay lit for you . i stay lit . i don ' t go dark . i never go dark !
where ?
never mind where . get outta here .
he ' s going to be one good-looking guy when i ' m done .
obviously , i was suspicious .
<person> ! you bitch !
i call the sheriff .
looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it .
but it would take an army of mechanics to do all that !
course he aint never killed nobody .
<person> grandpa <person> and grandmama talkin .
i mean , how can that be ? it just happened that way ? and i ' m not even getting into the fruits . i ' m just dealing with vegetables right now . with all those things coming out of the earth , there must be a god .
i ' m not getting the same religious effect that came over you . i don ' t know why , but i don ' t feel like running to a church to pray right this second .
you keep saying that . <person> at this . games i ' ve never heard of . <person> . <person> a car . viral ecstasy . <person> . in viral ecstasy , you are a virus invading a specific human body . you create ingenious viral strategies to cope with the efforts of the body ' s immune system to destroy you . ``
wait a minute . that reminds me . what precisely is the goal of the game we ' re playing now ? i mean , the rules , the objective . <person> ' s ever really said anything about what you have to do in existenz .
afraid so .
that ' s a big book you ' re writing .
no sir . begging your pardon , sir , there ' s a lot to be said for leisure . you ' re not used to it , you ' ve always been active , but in time -
never kid a kidder . go on back to the hotel .
i don ' t need <person> .
<person> ? seconal ?
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ?
all right , old man . <person> .
you don ' t think i can do it .
i think you can get killed .
i understand . then this is where we say goodbye .
that ' s . thank you .
does she even know you ' re here ?
my mom ? she doesn ' t care about me .
i wasn ' t planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen .
what did you find ?
i won ' t be pawed at , thank you very much
<person> , sorry .
<person> ' t worry about it . you want anything ?
no .
d ' <person> .
you ' re a very foolish boy , d ' <person> . but a very handsome one . good-bye .
my feet have never been on anything that wasn ' t directly attached to the ground .
stay until you feel better ? i would like to hear all the news .
i ' m talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in genoa and wind up here . if you don ' t know about ' em , who does ? <continued_utterance> i guess i heard wrong . <person> turns to leave .
<person> cage !
i didn ' t hear you .
well that ' s what i said . <continued_utterance> how do you like that mini-van ?
<person> - the part where we parry and joust , and get to know each other bit-by-bit . we ' re going to have to skip it . you ' ve been charged with murder . in four weeks , a judge will determine your fate based on what i write . you will talk to me --
there is no murder ! it didn ' t happen ! i don ' t have to talk to anybody !
we drank . we fought . he made his ancestors proud .
put him on the bed .
are you afraid of death ?
sure . are you kidding ?
what the hell happened ? we used to be good .
<person> , well we ' re not anymore .
who should i say is calling ?
an old friend .
during the time that you had him here , did you discover any particular habits of his , peculiarities , quirks , anything that might help me find him ?
it ' s all in the folder .
taxes is serious stuff , <person> .
i can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business . how much i make . how much i spend .
who ?
your daughter .
what about you ? you were a lawman .
i ' m busy . we ' re all busy . <person> , mayor , but you ' re really barkin ' up the wrong tree .
why ? begging your pardon , sir .
well , to put it in one sentence , people don ' t expect major generals to carry firewood .
i have no idea . i have no freaking idea !
she ' s looking for a payout , dude . just buy her stake and give her an exit .
and are you familiar with fema ? what the federal emergency management agency ' s real power is ? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . to create a non-elected government . think about that . what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas ?
are you saying it wasn ' t such a small outbreak ?
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar .
you know my work ?
they have paid with their lives . the destroyer did its job , and the casket is safe . all is well .
`` all is well ? ! '' they broke into the weapons vault ! if the frost giants had stolen even one of these
she wants to see <person> .
she ' s asleep .
<person> --
tell me what to do , <person> . i need guidance , not a fucking platitude . i ' m not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with . i won ' t do it . i want our life back .
i . i can ' t .
that ' s right . oh , <person> , i ' m sorry .
you don ' t understand what i mean by the river .
we ' re talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons , <person> , that human frailty you like to blather about , not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit .
before we knew it , we created the most popular men ' s magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .
so here we are . dead . but we never want you to want for anything . that is , we want you to have everything .
no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?
bastards put him on notice .
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything .
such enthusiasm . have i told you lately how proud i am of you ?
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel .
on whose orders ?
i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers , lead you into his chambers , and let you slay him where he lies . i ' ll keep the throne , and you will have the casket .
why would you do this ?
yes , the ship is down there . but the gold is gone .
that ' s absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
we ' d better check .
<person> , it ' s there . looks a little different , but it ' s there .
what are you doing here ? what do you want from me ?
you must try to understand , what i ' m here to do is only to protect my children . you and i have but short lives left . i can only hope the same isn ' t true for them .
well , if you don ' t mind my asking , sir , why did you let your son stay ?
it was his dream to go . i could hardly stand in the way of that , could i ?
<person> ' t get what ?
i just don ' t see it . you ' re skinny , you got a big nose , and you squint .
what was that ?
we ' re supposed to be honest .
mr . <person> in san fransisco .
he respond to the offer ? what ? what the hell ' s cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company ' s losing <number> million a quarter ? i guess he ' s giving lectures on how to lose money . if this guy opened a funeral parlor , no one would die , this turkey ' s totally brain dead . <person> is over and business is business . <person> buying . dilute the sonofabitch . <person> i want every orifice in his body flowing red .
it should , or it will ? least going back the way we came we know what we ' re up against .
you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you ' re wrong , and you ' re not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it . we ' re heading <person> . <person> calm , cold and direct <person> says:
i ' m not sure who to trust .
then we will discover the truth together .
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself .
probably would ' ve too if <person> wasn ' t around to stop you .
whats that , honey ?
there aint no water in the swimmin pool . just a dead tree fell in , probly from bein struck by lightnin .
i ' m glad this is working out .
you really happy ?
<person> , i don ' t understand . what happened to the chevy-nova ?
sold it to a sailor on the alameda naval air base . a man should never own a car for more than three months , estelle . that way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile !
<person> . <person> the dog .
except my life was no longer normal . there were blinding migranes now . <continued_utterance> . nerve damage . why ? this is how big business operates . a random accident . a `` lifestyle mishap ? '' they are not coincidences . how do you think air-tight contracts are broken ?
you afraid of the dark ?
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they can ' t see . i can ' t see nuthin ' , so it ' s all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it ' s all the same to me .
there is no candy !
what do you mean ? it ' s it ' s a goddamn mini-mart ? !
you said , `` <person> '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?
yes . <person> right now or right when i thought of it . the name and memory of <person> is haunting me . lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again . because it is only a feeling , i am powerless to stop it . and another thing , <person> , when the next murder happens you will help me solve it .
what else ? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths .
<person> ?
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
i felt limited . i felt confined . i felt like i was suffocating .
maybe i could take him , but i ' d have certain conditions . i would have to be the only dad on the scene . <person> would have to go .
that ' s asking a lot . <person> worships the ground i walk on .
what the hell ' s going on here ?
nothing ' s going on-
find out who this renquist it .
how ?
i ' ve been played like a grand- piano -- by the master , <person> the great . and today was the big crash . liquidation sale . he ' s gon na carve <person> into little pieces and sell it all off .
i ' m sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .
so how ' s the book ?
it ' s fine . it ' s done . basically . i ' m just sort of . . tinkering with it .
well , they don ' t `` seem '' to be that great so i can ' t wait for this one . hey , here we are ! two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame . bullets flying !
<person> ! that ' s not why we ' re here .
no .
what ' s this . ?
<person> on you counselor .
is that it ?
i don ' t believe you . <continued_utterance> was i worth this ?
whatever the cost .
<person> said , the tax man . gave me a dollar to tell you so .
tax man ! fucking i . r . s . how low can you get ? how low can you get ? <continued_utterance> they ' re lowlife . how can people come and take a man ' s car ? . his cadillac ?
you need to explain it .
all right . i want you . to .
what did you tell him that for ?
you don ' t know what it ' s like . i think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth .
yeah .
i . i don ' t know what to say . i --
have you been hurt ?
me ? no . well , in the accident i was injured , but .
i ' ve already seen your photographs .
<person> , but i enlarged this one . thought you might be interested . <continued_utterance> anyway . enjoy your lunch . <continued_utterance> how is that , <person> , pretty good ?
isn ' t there something you .
that ' s not the question . it ' s over . do you think that it ' s my fault ? if i ' d . if i ' d . i never should have taken it . there was no way that i was going to win .
around four . <person> and these pachucos poppin ' switchblades like punks . the only thing that was keepin ' him `untouched ' was <person> . is he really dead ?
there ' s blood all over his house , seems to belong to him . there ' s just no body . not yet .
what killed those men can ' t be identified in simple medical terms . my god , we can ' t even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv . we have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved .
a plague ?
<person> , peanut , you stuck with me after i planted <person> . a man cant ask for more than that .
you move me , sailor , you really do . you mark me the deepest .
in my office , after <person> day .
<person> ?
no . she only likes hunters -- not gatherers .
i wouldn ' t read too much into that . she kisses , then tongues the spear tip . zed okay , that might mean something .
yes .
what did she say ?
are you drunk , <person> ?
i was until about an hour ago .
maybe you resent how busy i ' ve been .
what are you . ? no .
that ' s not why he ' s sending me .
why then .
this looks like new grass to you ?
it looks pretty green for this climate .
yo , i ' ll fight him .
do me a favor guy , go back to your bag . we don ' t need anybody else getting hurt . g ' head . take a walk .
i ' m fine .

. well , put ' er there , partner ! these two homeboys are gon na show the world what golf in west texas is all about !
no , <person> . i didn ' t mean i want you to play with me . i just want you to caddie for me , read my putts , club me , that kinda stuff .
and i will always be there , old friend .
and mate .
i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar . why ?
last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot . know what happened : he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung .
the only mistake is that they didn ' t kill us in the elevator . <continued_utterance> wait here .
no . i ' m going with you .
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car .
that ' s funny : you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
you do ? what else you do ?
i ' m a national merit finalist . i ' m on the hi-q team and the math team . i ' m in the spanish club . i ' m a thespian . i ' m vice-president of my class . i ' m on the volleyball team .
let me worry about that .
<number> west <number> th .

oh , hey - it was nothing .
<person> ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight ?
we would speak with her .
she has refused to leave my father ' s bedside . you can bring your `` urgent '' matter to me , your king .
i don ' t know , honey . i guess it would depend .
on what ?
nah .
never ?
we are . <continued_utterance> he ' s doing well today .
i ' m very proud of him . he ' s been through a lot in his life . a lot of ups and downs , a lot of bad spells . a couple i ' d thought had broken him . i mean emotionally . they were bad . but he made it . yes he did .
howd it happen , peanut ? he just pull out the old toad and let it croak ?
youre terrible crude sometimes , sailor , you know ?
i aint so sure its a great idea , but thats up to you . just dont tell her where we are .
<person> me ? yall got a phone here i can use ?
what is it ? you know so much about arabland tell me what it is .
well , based on my knowledge of the region , its culture and her people i would have to say it ' s a box .
not if i can see the proof with my own eyes .
<person> ! all i ' m asking you to do now is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the fourth dimension . <person> , will you please hand me that box ?
you shouldn ' t worry about me .
what about me ?
what the hell is this ?
it ' s a prescription .
<person> ' t tell me how to react !
keep your voice down .
dr . m . ! everybody ' s looking for you .
i said shut up !

<person> , you ' re not mad at me .
i don ' t know . just . whispering .
what ' d you see , <person> ?
hi , <person> . nice to meet you .
she ' s very cute .
i tried everything . a spoon . i poured milk into her mouth , she just spat it out . i don ' t know what to do , i ' m not a mother .
sometimes she likes it heated . <continued_utterance> she ' s a good baby .
that ' s not right . the clock .
<person> ? no , it ' s not . it should read .
gieg , <person> .

do you have to call me that ?
when ?
you think it ' s funny ? me locked in ?
i ' m buying milk . i just thought i ' d say hello . <continued_utterance> look , i know it ' s probably too late , but is there any way you can come out for a little while ?
brian , i think you ' re going crazy .
<person> , in ten seconds i eat the staircase .
<person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> here .
we should have jumped his ass .
now <person> , you tie palmer up . <continued_utterance> we ' re going to draw a little bit of everybody ' s blood .
but did you tell him ?
he ' s away . at the <number> nd anniversary of the chicago seven trial .
probably waiting for me .

it doesn ' t instill confidence in my clients . <person> means that you ' re dealing with someone of importance . i thought i had a couple tonight . they just slipped away . slipped away . i ' m gon na take a bath -- my neck ' s been tight since this morning .
i ' ll turn out the lights .
but . he sacrificed his own daughter .
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it : those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids . your father arranged for your sister ' s abduction . he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program , so that she would survive . as a clone . he had different hopes for you . that you would uncover the truth about the project . that you would stop it . that you would fight the future .

i ' m in . we ' re in . count us in . etc .
<person> , a man ' s driving down the road with his son and they get in a crash . two ambulances come and take the man and his son to different hospitals . <person> goes into the operating room , the doctor looks at him and says , ' i can ' t operate on this boy . he ' s my son .

you ' re going to need these micro- pods to download your new identities . i assume that you both have had those industry standard bioports you mentioned installed .
but you were so wonderfully bad . so scary and crazy . i had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but i thought my character was kind of boring .
well , you know , i ' m a gas-jockey in real life , so i was kind of disappointed that i was basically the same thing in the game . a little more fantasy , there , fellers .
<person> , <person> . i ' m madmartigan . <continued_utterance> you a woodcutter ?
<person> .
i ' m not sure it ' s going to make a lot of difference to the germans .
oh , i don ' t know about that . think about it - you ' re a boche , just working out which of two chaps to shoot - and you thought - `` good lord - one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed ! '' you might shoot the other one instead .
<person> , right . <person> .
why not ?
why not ?
because i ' m fighting him .
never kid a kidder . go on back to the hotel .

he was so pissed .
did you meet the president ?
<person> , your father knows the president .
she didn ' t cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .
maybe she used another name .
well , right now it ' s gon na be your funereal .
go ahead and throw that punch . but you ' d be more successful with a punch
i don ' t mean to be rude , but i ' ve got something i need to talk to my friend about . in private .
aw , i understand . i didn ' t mean to bother ya . it ' s just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves . you better dance with me before you leave , or i ' ll never forgive you .
she has refused to leave my father ' s bedside . you can bring your `` urgent '' matter to me , your king .
we would ask you to end <person> ' s banishment .
that was the nicest thing i ever saw anybody do .
it was still gratitude .
oh , this isn ' t my car . it ' s down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just didn ' t think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
that ' s all right . i got it .
i don ' t want to know what ' s under here .
it ' s going to be fine , you ' ll see .
me !
that ' s right , my little friend . <person> . we ' re going fishing .
just , just a little coffee ?
maybe tomorrow .
by accident --
<person> , he ' s careless . reckless . is this really the best time to be making a new friend . ?
that ' s lonely for you , i guess . i always think of motel rooms as lonely .
oh , yes , well , they can be .
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we ' re so close , the town is going to be ours . <person> ' t throw away your future <person> !
i can stay with the brokerage firm . and you ' re doing fine . we can survive without <person> <person> .

i never trusted the doctors . what happened next was surreal . that same arrogant bastard , dr .
<person> , wake up . as your friend , i think you should see what you did to <person> . the press won ' t get hold of this if you get . away quickly .
this is <person> . that ' s not <person> . this is <person> . i didn ' t do that do that to her . <person> , someone ' s setting me up .
it ' s busted .

i don ' t hear it .
<person> , well , it ' s a nasty problem .
who ' s <person> ?
that beauty i managed to swipe
remember about the light you ' re supposed to see when you ' re dyin ' ?
<person> , don ' t think about that now .
it ' s bullshit . <person> ' s got no intention of honoring it . they want stemmons files though . i think <person> ' s been working angles for awhile , doing his own investigations .
what did you do to his place ? nice quiet neighborhood one minute , nagasaki the next .
no , she ' s beautiful . but a pill .
so you don ' t feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood not to mention her legacy not to mention her raison d ' etre .
i know . i ' m much in demand around here . will you excuse me ? if you have any questions , just ask .
who is <person> ?
twenty to one .
i don ' t see <person> winning . fuck it , i ' m not gon na even place the bet . i just made a hundred bucks .
one . <continued_utterance> i must say , <person> , capitalism seems to be treating you well .
i used to sell weapons ; now i buy votes . off the record .
i don ' t see you crying about my drinking it .
how old are you ?
<person> , what the fuck ?
<person> to me <person> ' s part of it . maybe at the top of it . <continued_utterance> yeah . i can put it all together when i get back , ' til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual .
i went and looked at-some babies just now .
oh ?
do you swear to preserve the peace ?
i swear .
i ' ll tell her .
if her ass gets red , tell her not to listen to any pediatricians -- they ' re full of shit .
and what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow ?
he only met you a few hours before me . he would do the same .
i think you ' re a damn fool .
<person> , <person> is four . it would be nice for him if his parents were married .
<person> your load , sucker . you ain ' t the judge and executioner around here !
who you trying to protect , mutherfucker ? i ' m telling you this s . o . b . could be one of them .
what ' d you expect ? a stick-up ? empty your safe ? i ' m about to disappear for good , and you ' re gon na fund my new life . you can ' t counter-punch out of this . arrest me and i snitch the world . i ' ll hold that over your head for the rest of your life . <person> on our deal and it won ' t matter if it ' s tomorrow or ten years from now . i ' ll fry you with that file . i ' m officially outta time now chief . call it .
<person> ' s body . bury it .
that ' s asking a lot . <person> worships the ground i walk on .
it ' s your choice . life with me and the dog you love . or a pet-free existence with a shallow , egotistical poet .
he ' s awful cute .
so was the one in kansas city , and the one in <person> , ohio , and the one in waco , texas .
. of the procedures .
yes , the roving nurse .
how does that work ?
pleasure delaying . you don ' t know ? you keep the relationship casual until the absolute breaking point . and then , one night , or afternoon , or morning . it could be months from now . oh , you know how it works -
i ' ll get it .
no , you stay with <person> .
<person> . i was thinking of phoenix or seattle -- lots of opportunities in both those places .
what about your fabulous boyfriends ? what about the fabulous , boring <person> ? is he coming , too ?
stemmons files . and <person> ' s body . he committed suicide after you subpoenaed him .
this body is in your possession ?
<person> .
all right <person> , try and kick your legs . <continued_utterance> excellent , <person> !
i couldn ' t sleep .
little young for that , aren ' t you ? <continued_utterance> what shall i make you ?
maybe we should compare .
perhaps we should . just for the sake of research .
it was maybe a week after the accident .
but i don ' t remember .
oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant .
oh it ' s just a rental . i ' m moving to the east side soon . i ' ve got a couple of deals brewing with <person> . but that ' s just conversation . what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . friday . <person> . <person> .
no .
well , i never heard of him either . but this was one brave son-of-a- bitch . <person> for the confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another . then after the war he ran and won the governorship of louisiana -- twice !
fuck you . this is bullshit . i ' m outta here .
<person> down , <person> .
<person> me .
no . not like you . <continued_utterance> what the -- ? !

what ? what ' s not funny , thelma !
<person> ? how big ?
hundred seventy-five a week , take home .
why are you in new orleans ? if you dont mind my askin .
certainly not . we are here only briefly , in fact , until this evening , when we fly to austin , texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the cia .
do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars ?
guilty .
<person> ' s take a look at the body .
smells like . coffee plants .
i don ' t want you to see him outside school activities .
<person> . but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life .
there ' s been an accident , <person> . we have to go back .
no . there ' s no accident . it ' s just more stalling . <person> slows beside a police officer . <continued_utterance> what ' s going on ? <continued_utterance> is there any way around ?
weak . weak . comical . clown .
<person> good . and as a <person> is never weak , and only rarely a clown , your first kiss must be all the things that you are . like this .
it ' s the middle of the night --
i don ' t give a shit what time it is !
<person> . that ' s my maiden name .
<person> ' you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
right . well , i wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh , to the neighborhood . i ' m <person> . from next door .
this really isn ' t a good time .
i guess .
but you know , really , don ' t you ? you don ' t have to guess . i mean , it ' s your game , your little universe .
i have a better idea , let ' s run it out of them !
yeah , i ' m an oak all right . <continued_utterance> you ' re not that crazy , are you ?
i was sure of that , but the exact time escapes me .
it was two wars ago , i believe . nineteen seventeen . warden why now i recall . the chap who inquired about my father -- and the house that used to be across the way . but no . that ' s impossible . you haven ' t changed . you ' re not a day older . and your clothes . <continued_utterance> i ' m afraid it ' s going to take me a little time to explain . you see . there is an insistent , ear piecing siren . it lasts for three seconds .
i can stop them !
<person> !
he was riding <person> when he died .
you don ' t know that he was riding him .
why can ' t you be nice to me ?
you ' ve got enough people kissing your ass .
oh , well , that ' s just it . she ' s been coming down here , every half hour or so , to , sort of , check on me . if i ' m not here , she might . call the police or . . something .
<person> . so we decoy her . stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won ' t know the difference .
there ' s no rabbit here , so don ' t harass my customers .
i didn ' t come here to harass . i came here to reward .
<person> , have you pulled those files yet ? i need them by lunch .
i won ' t let you down , <person> . <continued_utterance> you little pencil-neck . so . yo . sista ! d ' you do anything interesting ?
when this is over , we ' re just gon na take off , the two of us . take a vacation .
what the hell are we doing ? we ' re doing all this together , trusting each other , making plans , and we haven ' t even slept together yet .
you ' ve got your chromium knock-out dart , microphone listening dart , explosive dart , even one with a splatter blood packet , whatever you need . they also come in a special <number> mm casing for use with your service pistol . <continued_utterance> multi-view binoculars . nine different enhanced vision modes , plus a digital camera . <continued_utterance> infrared , starlight . even a special `` penetrator '' mode to see through walls , curtains , almost anything . <person> aims at the shooting range .
i think i ' ll hang on to these .

yeah . but i never believe her anyway .
<person> . i ' ll work him in for an interview . <person> , <person> , how come you ' re quitting the business ?
we ' re a dying breed , <person> . <person> luck . <continued_utterance> i feel good . i feel great . i feel wonderful !
<person> . yes , she will always be ze first conquest , but all zis time you sought zis was ze end , ze one and only , when in fact it is only ze beginning . <person> lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany .
<person> , the police are here ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! maybe i can sneak out the back !
clementine .
oh yeah , for sure , i dunno . <person> , can you do me a favor ?
i can ' t . <continued_utterance> i can ' t go any farther .

i said you don ' t got the game .

`` . especially <person> ' s theorem . ``

<person> well .
i ' m looking for a man hiker .
this `` man hiker '' alone or wit someone ?
what .
do you think you ' ll be talking with <person> some time tonight ?
all right . i want you . to .
<person> ? kill him ? . how ?
i had to put him down .
that ' s a sad story . do you think you could ask <person> something for me ?
that ' s good . and you ' d heard about <person> ' s escape ?
oh , yes .
i ' m the fucking law ! <continued_utterance> keep talking , <person> .

that ' s eight years of school and training -- after college . and all that doesn ' t necessarily make you a better human being .
i could do it if i tried . even kelly thinks so .
she ' s the only judge who handles these cases and if i look bad in front of her right now , i ' m screwed . i ' ll have to close my fricking doors .
then dump it . give her poplar . it sucks but you ' ve got your practice to worry about , right ?
it ' s in the bible , see . you better go buy him a present . <person> , <person> . let me give him the gift ; cuban cigars -- <person> , his favorite and hard to get .
<person> outside .
the doctors .
she ' s protecting the doctors she ' d be up there on the stand .
your first homicide , that ' s gon na happen , <person> .
i just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .
she knows not to steal . i ' ve taught her better than that .
<person> , but you ' re not her parents , anymore , you and <person> . her parents are <person> and <person> . the five minutes you spend a day with her can ' t compete with that kind of constant bombardment . you ' re outgunned , amigo .
load of bullshit .
we ' ll see . <person> ' s try <person> .
but you ' re hopeful ?
yes . i am .
<person> ? you want to be in `` heaven ? ''
i turned eighteen over spring break . i ' m eligible .
what !
what did you say to <person> the night of the accident ?
excuse me , sir , what ' s going on here ?
commander , if you are fired upon , the president will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you . he doesn ' t want to have to do that . it ' s very important that he doesn ' t , or things could go very badly out of control .
such ignorance ! <person> ' t they know that after the fever breaks we are no longer contagious ?
i ' m going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regular hours . i ' ll put time aside for you late in the day . and it won ' t be possible for you to eat in the dining room either . but i promise i ' ll find someplace suitable .
i said , ' i don ' t think so ! '
still not getting it .
i have money .
<person> for you . save it . now take this , it ' s too early to argue .
-dubious honor if you knew the other people <person> knows . so you want to catch her in violation of her service contract ?
exactly . the morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating : nymphomaniac , criminal , communist . anything along these lines . once you visit the set of her `attack of the atomic vampires , ' you ' ll see the void that is her character . we haven ' t a photograph handy , but she ' s playing the lead female role .
he ' s right . they get set up in them rocks it ' s the end for us .
' course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party ! then what larks !
stranger my foot , it was my grandmother who helped you into this world .
well , i don ' t want to put you out .
uh huh . and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm . i say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin ' her .
no way . not <person> .
lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !
what ?
is <person> here ?
i refuse to be a burden to anyone .
you ' re not a burden , you ' re my husband .
no . i don ' t eat the food . it doesn ' t taste right .
that ' s <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , why are you fidgeting ? can ' t you get comfortable ?
if he had died in our care , we would be required to take him . since we found him dead , you will have to wait for the county to pick him up .
how long will that take ?
that ' s a good little girl . i knew you ' d see reason . <continued_utterance> ahh ! ah !
i ' m sorry . i didn ' t do it ! can i still have my dog ?
i want you to trust me .
maybe someday .
but i like it here .
you ' re going , buster !
what you just said . say it again .
i just want to get married .
i don ' t care who she marries , but i don ' t want her marrying you !
why don ' t we just talk about this in a nice , rational manner .
you just keep looking around , that ' s all .
no , i was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments , actually . <continued_utterance> i ' ve actually got to confess to you , <person> . that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that i ' ve been kind of unable to write . on account of the fact that i was in jail for a little while .
is it religious ?
no -- even though it talks about god , i wouldn ' t say it was religious .
out where ?
in the neighborhood . he ' s been watching me . through the windows .
sometimes you have to do stuff you don ' t want to do . it ' s all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .
i ' m getting so good at this .
well , why stop at that ?
i don ' t .
<person> <number> i ever saw . you crunched that dog , baby . gorgeous shot , etc .
molly , i ' m an idiot . i gave away the open . the one time in my life i know the play is to hit the lay up -- my whole life and future and career on the line , and i still can ' t make myself do it . i am a twisted human being and a cautionary tale . and i guess i ' m a fool ?
well . the way i figure it , if it weren ' t called `` death '' , it wouldn ' t be so bad . i mean what if it were called `` dink '' ?
dink ?
patricia . you met her .
would i like her ? just kidding . <person> ' t this great ? have some peanuts . of course i have to live out of a suitcase for a least three weeks , and then there ' s the inevitable legal hassle , more of your inheritance down the drain .
is <person> here ?
<person> , <person> . <person> ' s here . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s leaving .
that enough ?
no ! more oil ! much more , you insolent dolt !
. got a strange call from the sec . they asked to see my records .
. <person> ' re <number> m in the account numbers and i ' m the invisible man . they ' re always looking for red flags , <person> ' s always getting checked by them , they never come up with anything . we ' re invulnerable on this .
i just want a friend . just one friend for just one minute .
<person> , how about one friend for the rest of your whole life ?
<person> said it was a frog . how many frenchmen you know around here ? <person> ain ' t ' facilitating ' shit .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> are we looking for negs or prints ?
i ' m calling from professional nurse quarterly .
from the magazine ?
i called him a sissy .
well , he sure ' s hell can ' t sue you for slander . that boy fights for the pink team . did you make him cry ?
i see it . <person> , it ' s on the inside , <person> . the inside is your territory .
even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain .
forty . forty-five minutes .
we better start closing off the outside hatchways .
yeah , but where ' d they come from ?
where ' d they come from ? okay , worms , probably in the jurassic period . <person> radiation was much higher then . so they mutated . and they got so big they just sank right into the ground and fell asleep . but now continental drift has brought them to the surface , ready to be harvested by the ancient alien meat growers who planted them here . everybody stares at her , then they smile , realizing she ' s pulling their legs .
you ' re being defensive -- cut to the chase and tell me why you ' re here .
well . i ' m smitten with a woman .
what did you need ?
i needed to feel alive . i wanted to do something . outrageous . and . i don ' t know . it felt good to be needed . to be trusted . to be special . <continued_utterance> there ' s so much i wanted to do in this life , and it ' s like i haven ' t done any of it . and the sand ' s running out of the hourglass . i want to be able to look back and say : see ! i did that . it was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and i fucking did it ! and i frankly don ' t give a shit if you understand this or not .
there ' ll be some deterioration . that ' s inevitable , but we can ' t say how much .
during the time that you had him here , did you discover any particular habits of his , peculiarities , quirks , anything that might help me find him ?
what took you so long ?
what do you want , <person> ?
<person> ' t she want to take her ?
sure she did , but she was just leaving for some stupid cruise around the world . the entire fucking world ! with some bimbo boyfriend of her ' s . and a bunch of retired bozos .
to jump all over you when i ' m the one who ' s really . oh , <person> , i don ' t know how to say this --
what is it ?
where ' s m ?
soon she ' ll be everywhere .
go ahead . no , not on the towels , they ' re all covered with crap . <continued_utterance> . what the hell is this friggin ' mess ? oh , man , this is unbelievable ! to think , they bombard us day and night with their goddamn tv commercials ! and will you look at this junk ? this stuff is pure shit -- you tape it closed , it sags , you undo the tape : bingo -- the whole goddamn thing falls apart !
well , whaddya expect , if you pull on it like an ape , it ' s gon na rip !
if you say ' look for the good stuff , ' i ' m gon na get <person> ' s <number> / <number> and shoot myself !
seriously , though : give the place a chance . give him a chance .
you wrote her letters ?
mail . it was called mail .
ahh . so what you ' re saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game -- not about your personal life .
<person> , i didn ' t know we were gon na get into my personal life !
how did you know where to find me ?
i ' ve been tailing you since you get back from mars .
. few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .
oh really ? well , i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june .
<person> , what ' d i ever do to you ?
you came back , <person> . you came back .
two-hundred dollars . i ' ll do it ! i ' ll kill her !
<person> , i ' d be doing the world a favor , ridding it of the likes of you . get your miserable ass off the floor . you ' re positively pathetic . go on , go kill <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' m not letting you walk for nothing . two hundred dollars . do it , boy .

<person> , well , we ' ll see what happens .
it ' s so nice you could join us on such late notice .
oh , no !
you knew . you knew all the time , that he was out there , that he was coming for me , and you lied . you used me , you used me as bait . you made love to me -- what , to pass the time as you waited for him to strike ? he has no answer . he can ' t deny what she says . <continued_utterance> he ' s struck again . five men are dead at the pipeline .
i ' m coming with you .

if we see a thief or a pickpocket , we just slap him around -- maybe cut off a finger or an ear , or the tip of his nose , lower lip -- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion -- then we take our share of the loot and let him go . mostly what we worry about are activist types , rabble rousers , getting people all riled up against the king or the temple priests .
we both bite at the same time .

oh come off it , <person> . what about what ' s-his-name . <person> ? you could ' ve at least passed the baton on that one .
<person> , <person> . <person> was all right for awhile .
because he was my friend .
no , <person> . you weren ' t friends . <person> didn ' t have friends . he saved you because he wanted it that way . it was his will .
explain it . i told you .
shoot him .
<person> did that stint at the nut house -- leak his file to your friends at the times-
my friends would be more interested in this . <person> ' s preliminary : white paint chips found embedded in sanderline <person> ' s scalp . a matching dent on the white window sill . i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time <person> flew out of it . it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd .
i know you don ' t know them . of course you don ' t know them .
why am i looking at pictures of people i don ' t know ?
why , i ' d thrash him from top to bottomamus !
<person> ' you met an elephant ?
ah , you ' ve got dinner with your daughters .
that ' s right . i do .
skeptical about what ?
your answer to my question . it ' s one thing to have never been injured in your life , but to state that you ' ve never taken ill , well that ' s a whole new level .
<person> , i ' m lucky it didn ' t find
this is one big mother !
i don ' t know much about him .
he ' s very bold . do you really think my hair is beautiful ?
and another thing . stop with this spaceman thing . it ' s getting on my nerves .
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with <person> ?
oh , shit ! well , hang on !
<person> , thanks !
<person> . i ' ve raised my rate . i might even cut my sessions to forty minutes .
<person> , i know you don ' t like flattery but if anybody i know is going to win a nobel prize , it ' s you . you got ta be thinking about your next book so i know you ' ll find this case particularly interesting .
reading other people ' s mail is not only impolite , it ' s illegal .
<person> don ' t mind . he likes i read his mail . saves him the time . plus a lot of folks around here can ' t read , so it ' s more a public service , really .
i ' m going for fearsome here , but i just don ' t feel it . i think i ' m just coming off as annoying .
<person> ! -- oh , hi , bo .
a what ?
i ' m sorry , this is -- -- this is very , very expensive . it ' s -- tell him this is an expensive watch .
of you ? never .
why don ' t you nap before dinner ?
yes , sir . we can be sure we get all the missiles , and we remove <person> so this can never happen again .
is this the chiefs ' recommendation ?
did you ever find out what it wanted ?
she said , `` you know . `` that i know .
then you ' re saying there ' s no negligence , based on my question ?
i . given the limits of your question , that ' s correct .
<person> - the world is my office .
<person> ' s take a look at the body .
that ' s pretty clean .
but he ' s decided to go to <person> too .
oh , yes there is !
. you really just giving me this car ?
<person> , i ' ll say . they gave you a real toon-a-roo .
what am i , <person> ?
it ' s broken , sir . i can feel it .
let me help you .
you ' d never understand .
try me .
can ' t that female take no for an answer ?
oh --
my friends would be more interested in this . <person> ' s preliminary : white paint chips found embedded in sanderline <person> ' s scalp . a matching dent on the white window sill . i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time <person> flew out of it . it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd .

just stay off the property until i ' m off the phone .
why ?
dozens . it ' s very sad .
i went and looked at-some babies just now .
i changed my mind . gim me the three wood .
you can ' t clear the dogleg with a three wood .
oh .

what have you got ?
<person> was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists . the guys processing this p <number> p into speed .
i know you didn ' t .
he had no right to do that .
hello , <person> ? how ' s it going ? i got it , dad ! <person> ! <person> ! my father ' s in one of his moods again . <person> menopause , you know . so how are you ?
all right .
were you scared ? tell me honestly .
i was close to being scared that time .
people are miserable all over the world and you ' re killing yourself ? you should be ashamed .
<person> ' t talk that way to me !
they give us the food we eat , the clothes we wear . we must do as they command .
what happens to your people when they go below ? weena no one knows . no one has ever returned . time traveller it won ' t happen to you .
<person> , this is an elementary school .
elementary school ? i thought you were <person> ?
oh , come on , rachel . no way .
there is always a way ! but you are such a . a glotzkopp you can not see ! you ' d rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !
if you ' re anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we didn ' t want you when you were born , so who cares if we ' re dead ? am i right ?
but we did want you . it ' s just that you don ' t always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .
we can increase your medication .
yes . medication .
we got ta take care of her . when she gone . the problem gone . <person> ? we ' ll head off then , <person> , just like i said .
we ain ' t gon na make it , are we <person> ? i ain ' t never gon na see it . it ' s over for that , isn ' t it <person> ? just say it . <continued_utterance> she was just some stupid housewife mouthin ' off .
thank you , <person> .
that ' s not the way to <person> ' s trailer . i told you .
i thought you weren ' t old fashioned .
in some things . when we were children , there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn ' t have something on you that didn ' t make a
what are you gon na do ? cu - witch looks up o . s . - speaks -
what do you think i ' m going to do ? but that ' s not what ' s worrying me -- it ' s how to do it . these things must be done delicately .
you ' re strong enough . but you ' re going to need courage , <person> .
i don ' t want courage . i don ' t want to be a warrior . all i ' ve ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
i don ' t know ! yes , yes , as much as <person> -- more than <person> !
am i special ?
i ' m working on it , i ' ve made three calls . i can ' t stop thinking about how much i love you .
that ' s sweet .
man , you are having a bad week .
she must think i ' m such a nothing , such a loser . a lousy driving range pro living in a winnebago , making five bucks an hour plus lessons .
i don ' t know . just tell ' em what happened .
<person> part ?
just us .
<person> , what are you going to need to clean it up
just listen to me ! i ' ve been doing some reading . in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks . it became part of the ottoman empire . when the turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards . they buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle boxes . i read about this , man . i read about it .
<person> , if you read it it must be true .
i don ' t like it .
<person> as well hear him out . <person>s , what choice we got ? but no matter what happens , see it through to the end . if you don ' t i ' ll curse the day i ever laid eyes on you .
the thing is , i ' ll need a first mate .
i know where you can find any number of naked girls who ' d love to hop on board .
yes . i ' m to bring you right up . the valet will take your car -
i ' d prefer to park it myself . temperamental . <person> has a mind of its own .
you know carpentry ?
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school .
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here . worn down to nothing now .
picks up again just on the other side .
set one up .
so who you out sleuthin for now ? .
<person> .
<person> like they had some nuts -- dried fruit -- some kind of green leafy vegetable --
i ' m a robber .
you ' re a bank robber ?
do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire ? no , i suppose you don ' t . the next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel . do you know what that is ? i ' m sorry i was angry with your people . i had no right to be . no more than if i had visited the island of bali in my own time . you were safe inside your great house , yet you came out into the night to warn me . the one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice . you have that quality , <person> . i ' m sure all of your people have it . all it requires is someone to reawaken it . i shall try if you ' ll let me . will you ?
i do not understand you , but i believe you .
that ' s correct .
then why can ' t we see it ?
it makes you nervous ?
yes .
what do you mean ?
i started seeing things .
you are very sweet , but <person> has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him . he has a policy .
if you become a widow , you will need someone around to fix the whatnots . we like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge . i know <person> ain ' t gone yet , but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line . i just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal , to be first in line so to speak .
. a cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the <number> th man on the deal team ? the last to know ?
can ' t tell you that , mr . <person> .
our next move ? i ' ll say one thing , <person> . this is some vacation . i sure am having a good time . this is real fun .
if you weren ' t so concerned with having a good time , we wouldn ' t be here right now .
well . maybe we better not ask her . but thank you anyway .
well , we can ask her . that won ' t hurt . <continued_utterance> <person> , this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride , and i thought since .
i should ask this woman out .
yes !
how do you know <person> ?
kiss me . <continued_utterance> <person> ! leave me alone !
by then it ' s too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
use your grenades ! maybe we can blow it up underwater !
what say we get outta here and go crush a bucket ?
we just got here thirty seconds ago . <person> ' t this stuff great ? mary points to an architectural model . mary is this one art deco or art nouveau ?
<person> !
i knew you would !
' <person> thought maybe you and i could go if you weren ' t already taking someone .
i mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year .
surely you believe in living dangerously .
not at that price . time to surrender .
one lousy letter eighteen months ago . i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way .
. hey , i don ' t need your charity .
was it in the diaper , or not ?
the dope ? it was in the diaper , why ?
wrong .
you ' d lie to protect him .
we ' re talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons , <person> , that human frailty you like to blather about , not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit .
y ' mean you ' re gon na make me feel lousy ? i came here to feel better -- what kinda therapy is this ?
strenuous activity ?
then maybe i ' d be . open to that .
that ' s not the game .
it ' s a second date . there aren ' t any rules .
are you saying . <person> is the man who ' s trying to kill me ?
you can drop the act , it ' s over .
no , i guess i ' ve been no help at all to you .
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
this is <person> . that ' s not <person> . this is <person> . i didn ' t do that do that to her . <person> , someone ' s setting me up .
<person> , the board and i have taken care of everything . they ' ve been really great , actually . all of this is going to disappear . we ' re all behind you . even the board . <continued_utterance> get out of here .
what ?
can i name the baby ?
i admit i don ' t know where he is .
you ' re the first one he ' ll contact .
mr . <person> , this is a most unusual motion .
nonetheless , your honor , we feel that our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law .
where ' s <person> ?
<person> asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians .
is that a fact ?
sure as gravity . i ' ve had a feeling about you from the start , <person> . it ' s nausea .
just go around him .
<person> .
well , i think thatandiacute ; s perfectly understandable .
iandiacute ; ll tell you one thing though .
thing is , the net in the basket isn ' t very comfortable , so tod-o wraps them up in the jib . after the deed was done .
he says they did the deed .
what brandd she smoke ?
camels , same as me . guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness .
oz .
you ain ' t from oz . oz is in that movie .
who is ?
a lot of people are taking the opportunity to jump on the anti- game bandwagon . they ' ve now heard rumours about what the existenz system is , and they say we ' ve gone too far psychologically , medically , socially , you name it . and i ' m afraid i wouldn ' t put it past our competitors to be involved in this , to try to whip up public opinion and kill our new system before it gets born . <continued_utterance> you ' re sure you don ' t want me to contact <person> , even just to see what they have to say ?
do out there , what you did in here .
what ' s that ?
check the scrawl .
r . k . <person> .

so what i want to do is stop it here . i ' m going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .

i know .
i can do this .
then let ' s go do this .

<person> . what do you think ?
<person> . i . <person> ' s been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she ' s pushing for suspension .
this is insane .
this just came in : there ' s something up with the british navy in the strait . rescue planes , helicopters ; two ships supposedly sailing from the persian gulf . they just chased away one of our news boats .

no . last night i couldn ' t sleep , so i just laid there looking up at the sky , counting the stars . there were over seventy . <person> makes you think , doesn ' t it ?
no .
<person> . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .

look , pal , money talks and bullshit walks . i don ' t have time for looky- loos .

i like your house . can i come in ?
that was really something . that dancing girl . what did it mean ?
<person> . if you work with <person> you learn that right away .
they know . it ' s the scent . we better split ' em up .
i have a better idea , let ' s run it out of them !
not really .
<person> ' t lie to me . <person> . <continued_utterance> i got it on spring break . <person> like hell .
i was just getting to the interesting part !
we ' ve already done the interesting part . do you forget ?

and you became a musketeer .
i joined the musketeers and a strange thing happened . i got my faith back .

<person> , don ' t , <person> ! come on , <person> . never mind . he ' s drunk .
i want them spitting blood !
thanks to you .
well , i can ' t imagine her working for you .
i don ' t set policy . you have the key ?
this is a police department . i ' ll be damned if this is going to go on without my knowledge .
i don ' t want to see her hurt .
i wouldn ' t do that --
you want to ask us a favor ?
a man threatened my children . these charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the nut-jobs out of the nut jar . would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary . i don ' t know what else to do .
no -- that ' s true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself !
the wizard of oz ? is he good or is he wicked ?
like i ' d grow up to be president , another reagan .
like you ' d make it to june . even cutting half your classes , you have a b- average .
they ' re taking the furniture ?
the furniture , the whole house . they locked it up . they confiscated it .
how can you not have a cell ?
how ' re you doing ? you all right ?
what do you want ?
your blood . all over me .
will you still get the money from your father ?
i told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .
now use it .
i just wanted to test it first .
<person> .
should be dead as well . your failure today is astonishing . it is a disgrace . <continued_utterance> do you know why the color is blue at the wick ? <person> starts to sweat . <continued_utterance> because that is where the flame is the hottest . <continued_utterance> the temperature is close to five hundred degrees .
poor <person> . the cold war is over . what have you got left ? economic espionage . <person> in the boardroom . so dull .
oh , you ' d be surprised .
i didn't hate me so much , id feel better wishin you luck .
cant all husbands be perfect , and your elmo probly wouldnta ever got that second one pregnant , you hadnt kicked his ass out .
it ' s not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i can ' t . i don ' t want to be alone . i need to know i ' m going to be taken care of .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
oh -- oh , come on .
<person> ? what ' d he say ?
<person> , i can imagine .
do me a favor , nance .
fore . !
i ' m glad i ' m well out of it .

oh sure , it ' s passed through my head . something really relevant for today like the luddite movement in <number> th century england .

<person> , i ' m a chicken , don ' t worry . <person> , listen to me .
<person> ?
it ' s magnificent . where did you get it ?

<person> , listen to me . where did you get this candy ?
what ?
me !
you ?
<person> . i can ' t .
go , or i ' ll kill you myself .
maybe i don ' t like being played , like she played us today . maybe i don ' t like that at all , jake . i ' m just pissed enough , maybe i ' ll rip the neck off my own grandmother .
you have a lot of talk in you , whole lot of talk .
are they okay ?
aside from the fact that <person> ' s eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and <person> spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn ' t broken , things couldn ' t be better .
what did she say ?
that she thought we were married .
mr . motor .
then that ' s it , i ' m going with one .
how much ?
<person> ?
no ! ! !
i need these .
brian , don ' t yell at me .
i ' m -- i ' m not yelling . i ' m just gettin ' a little frustrated here .
i put you here . that powerhawk-
-there ' s a body in the trunk-
comin ' to think of it , forty winks wouldn ' t be bad .
<person> ' t you start it , too !
nothing ' s going on .

she ' s blackmailing you , right ?
you can ' t be serious .
you ' re really leaving , huh ?
you bet . you gon na be staying up here ?
<person> told him to call . ' he ' s some very hotshot surgeon at mass . commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of <person> . you meet him at the hospital . ' she hands him typed memo slip .
. he wants to testify . ?
he was a war hero .
twice . <person> , i ' ve worked like a dog to keep your name in play , grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms .
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss .
your last chance . take the money .
no , they were asleep when i got here .
they ' re really cute . so what can i do for you ?
i think we should say some words over the grave .
what kind of words ?
nothing . i ' m not gon na tell him a thing . the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is .
you are so sweet to that guy , you really are . <person> not wanting to drag him into this . he is a lucky man .
-- the vengeance you seek . and the salvation of <person> . are waiting for you in the crown of the sphinx . the oracle head lets out a long sigh and goes limp , a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth .
<person> and <person> ! what was that all about ?
what makes you say that ?
because you ' re a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
well , call general mcaddie .
i don ' t have his number .
now it ' s back to the good life for us !
sleeping late ! different women every night ! i can ' t wait !
yes , i love you . i ' ve told you , but it doesn ' t really matter .
why ? it does .
awful lot of money .
<person> ' t take the heat , get outta the kitchen .
she left me . <person> .
left you . ? who ? <person> ?
they want us to identify ourselves .
tell them we ' re the american school ship , <person> .
they didn ' t have second-hand uniforms in my size .
oh , yeah , pull the other leg , it ' s got bells on it !
sure . as long as my doctor gives permission .
thank you for your hospitality , mrs . <person> .
no way ! get back on the highway .
<person> , i checked it out on the map .
<person> sitting across from him , impassive .
you finished your marriage . you wanted to come back and practice law . you wanted to come back to the world .
your father is a murderer and a thief . he stole what was ours , and left our world in ruins . we have the right to reclaim the casket .
not when you ' d use it to make war against other realms .
. <person> ' s not bad .
not bad . ? this guy ' s dr . <person> , the jury ' s going to love him , <person> . and you calm down , all right ? their guy , <person> ' s , the author of the book , ' methodology and practice , <person> . ' . and they got depositions from the nurses , everybody in the operating room , the scrub-nurse . ' all these guys are god . i saw them walk on water . ' they had an obstetrical nurse in there . we got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse ?
i can ' t imagine your readers are interested in ancient history . <person> and i lost the election by a wide margin .
it was only a few years ago , mr .
because you advised us to do that .
i presented you with that option . <continued_utterance> i ' m also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi .
they ' ll shoot us !
we run they ' ll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we ' re americans they might get scared , think we ' re part of a detachment and keep on going .
what , dear ? what was that ?
nevermind .
you ' d tell me if there was something wrong , wouldn ' t you , pumpkin ?
i ' m not a pumpkin ! <person> ? ! ! do i look even remotely like a pumpkin ? ! i ' m not a muffin , or a cupcake or a honeybear either ! and you don ' t understand anything dad .
easy there .
i ' m sorry . it ' s these goddamned shoes . i don ' t know how anyone actually walks in these things .
i ' m kinda not in the mood anymore .
we have to rewarm your hands . you have ice crystals in your blood . if we don ' t get circulation restored you could lose your fingers .
yeah .
the entire army-navy store . sold out ?
something wrong with buttons ?
buttons are <person> .
thought you said this was a private club . how come <person> allowed in without bein a member ?
you black ?
one can tell you are from back home . these people nowadays don ' t know what manners are .
where we come from , you had to know how to act right . you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir . you had to know your place .
curiosity , i guess .
about what ? how to improve your breast stroke ?
you miss him .
every hour . every minute . i wish he was here . i wish he could have sailed our girl . seen these boys . <continued_utterance> i ' d have liked to have said goodbye .
mr . <person> , this is a hospital , not a penitentiary . everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient ' s folder . whether you can make sense of it or not . <continued_utterance> <person> is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic . they see themselves as victims , and they always blame other people for the way they are . when <person> killed the mandrakis kids , it wasn ' t an act of hostility against the children but against their parents . he was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood . the criminal side of <person> is one of terrible , symbolic vengeance .
assuming he isn ' t found right away . what will happen to him ?
every triangle i ' ve ever seen never lasts . somebody ' s got to go .
is this supposed to mean something to me ? what triangle ?
well first of all i ' m fun . no denying that . and secondly , unlike <person> , i actually used to wrestle .
<person> , but <person> , you sucked .
`` . also killed was state <person> . continued on page seven . ``
you got that <person> ?
look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
oh i don ' t know , i think the tests work pretty well . sometimes they give me answers you wouldn ' t admit to in a million years .
i think so . maybe .
you are so brilliant .
so when the hell do we get to meet <person> ?
you ' ll meet him . <person> enough .
different foods make for different dreams . i ' ve got a whole theory about it . it ' s called `` the <person> of <person> . `` you ' ll find it in the american medical journal under ' w ' . <person> and swiss cheese , for instance , you get a cool , thin , blonde girl . turkey sandwich , you get a dark sort of stumpy girl , sexy though . now a liverwurst sandwich - you get both girls at once . bad night .
what do you dream on tuna ?
we were just --
-- i completely understand , sir . i ' ll leave you to your business . <person> night .
<person> asked me to .
you do everything <person> says ?
<person> ! come sta , ragazzo ?
okay , i guess .
my mom ? she doesn ' t care about me .
how do you know ? she ' s probably worried sick and just doesn ' t know how to reach you .
fun ! i could have lost my arm !
rex hasn ' t got any teeth . <continued_utterance> <person> .
. <person> destroyed by nuclear meltdown . british agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage ; <person> calls for british government to resign .
. as the advertising says : <person> never lies .
i ' m not your boy . i don ' t like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . <person> ' s just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
<person> ' t say that . i had a marriage of convenience with <person> , and look where that ' s lead . well , looks like we got ourselves a contract . bobby do we shake hands ? <continued_utterance> if you can ' t trust the man you ' ve hired to kill your wife . ? the thing is it ' s got to look like an accident ; that ' s the thing . if it doesn ' t , then it ' s no good . i won ' t get a dime , and it ' s my neck that ' ll be on the chopping block while you ' re living it up somewhere .
what ?
what you just said . say it again .
<person> -- what are you doing ?
just get dressed . i ' ll explain on the way .
i ' m not hanging . i ' m fixing my car --
you don ' t need a car you can ' t drive for a month . go see <person> .
i remember <person> always trying to help someone . he got <person> ' s daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who couldn ' t leave the house .
<person> always shows his good side and , like the moon , the other side is black . back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman . i ' m telling you <person> is nothing but evil . i ' m warning you -- you can ' t keep a wild animal as a pet around children .
i was close to being scared that time .
i ' m going for fearsome here , but i just don ' t feel it . i think i ' m just coming off as annoying .
you know . things .
things ?
<person> , calm down ! it ' s not illegal to buy stock or to be right . and it ' s not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment .
what if he asks where i got the money ?
stayin a few extra days in the big n . o . , huh ? this you ?
yes .
i don ' t get you , <person> .
i ' m not sure it is any kind of cell structure . biologically speaking .
so what do you make of it ?
you know damn well what we both make of it .
you think it ' s funny ? me locked in ?
locked in where ?
week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger . we can ' t feed all the hungry .
of course not . have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? no you ain ' t . you have to take just one and fatten him up . when you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . if you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . you just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste . <continued_utterance> you just take one ; you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground .
i should be eating with the crew .
humor me . eat it anyway .
i ' m telling you . there was something in her voice .
remember how we were ?
. we are . but we want a contract agreement -- iron-clad -- that if you buy it , you can ' t break it up .
i ' m still listening .
those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons . and what is the next step ?
hopefully cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step .
yes . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite prepared to tell you everything , though there isn ' t much you haven ' t guessed .
about the conspiracy ?
you hate gambling .
that ' s right . i do , don ' t i ?
now listen , guys , we got a problem here .
did she hear me say scotch straight up ?
but it would take an army of mechanics to do all that !
or a navy , <person> . or a navy .
what do you need ? money ?
um . <person> . i ' m broke . i got ta get back to worcester tomorrow . i got this girl there , and she ' s kind of in a bad situation . ? i just need to borrow some money . whatever you can spare . i ' ll pay you back . i ' ll pay you back , man .
just relax .
how ' m i gon na relax standing on a mine ! ?
so you were alone .
yes .
yeah , heaven on a june day .
what ' d he say about you having a job in d . c . ?
what the hell do we know about seismographs ?
nothing . but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her .
then you are completely unnecessary .
i have the documents , the landing authorizations , the security passes .
<person> . <person> !
the navicom !
we ?
i showed up with someone from the labor board and we refused to leave until they let us in .
is there any reason to believe they ' ve left the state ?
that ' s certainly possible .
you sure ?
yeah . i think maybe that ' s better .
i don ' t know .
we got a mistrial , you know . <person> -- did you hear what i said . ?
they come in any other styles or colors ?
this is your standard dart gun .
what ? !
what in the hell is that up there ?
excuse me .
hey , what are you doing in here ?
one of them is .
you have no poetry in you . it ' s about time you went in for girls , too . after all , you haven ' t many years left for that sort of thing .
why ?
i don ' t know . i guess i needed something .
nothing . tell me , what do you want out of life ?
where do you get these questions ?
how should i know ? <continued_utterance> i wonder how that .
turn it down !
hyperactive little fuckers , too . tough to keep up with in a wheelchair , i bet .
she ' s in a wheelchair ? !
i can ' t breathe in this . what am i going to do ?
i know what i ' m going to do . i ' m going to take one big deep breath , and that ' s going to be it for the next three hours .
where ?
istanbul .
you gon na call tonight ?
definitely .
and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .
yes . <person> to turn her toward the door . i told her we would talk on monday , in the office .
i was invited . what ' s your story ?
i don ' t know who you are or where you come from , but i don ' t like you . you ask too many questions .
i might do it wrong .
not possible . <continued_utterance> i love you , <person> . <continued_utterance> now ' s when you say something .
well . for one thing . i think it ' s despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ``
you think we should be more open minded ?
you did .
who led you into the most glorious of battles .
your aunt ?
humboldt county ?
you ' re not wrestling .
i know . i ' m just nervous a lot .
you lost ?
i blew the eight ball .
why ' s that ?
i ' m usually too tired to be .
i need to talk to you .
that ' s funny . i need to talk to you , too . perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room , <person> .
you ' re a fucking lunatic !
you ' re a madman ! smashes into me , attacks me . the man is crazy !
you got some kind of business with him ?
i ' m looking for him .
the boat thing ?
i could never be with anyone who has a boat .
only bad witches are ugly . <continued_utterance> the <person> are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east .
oh . but , if you please -- what are <person> ?
what are you going to do ?
i ' m going to -- run !
humor me . eat it anyway .
why are you here ?
yes .
just now .
it had a very strong , very real anti-game theme . i mean , it began with the assassination of a game designer .
or really ? but that ' s very creative . <continued_utterance> but on second thought , i see what you mean . it makes me nervous . you think it must have come from one of our game players ?
hm ?
a salesman -- that ' s what i am . i mean , i ' m gon na be anyway . i ' m starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as i get enough seed money .
sure she is . that ' s why she got an unlisted number and you haven ' t heard squat from her in a dozen years . oh you ' re good , ted . you ' re a real piece of work .
<person> , let ' s forget it . <person> ' s forget the whole thing .
<person> . she ' s pretty good in bed , then ?
hey , slow down you ' re gon na miss the turn !
because i felt like it . what do you care ?
i couldn ' t do it .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .
like i said , open container , <person> . i . , misdemeanor possession . <person> to make it disappear . for you , poof , it ' s gone . <continued_utterance> one thing bothers me . that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he ' s lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what ' s your daughter on ?
great start , simmsy .
hey , <person> -- heard you put a monster number up there .
who is that horrible friend of yours ?
madmartigan .
<person> ?
colon cancer .
yup .
did you .
my name ' s bernice . <person> .
nice to meet you bernice . <person> , i think <person> mentioned you . he said you were frumpy , but now that i ' ve met you , i can see <person> is a lying bastard .
<person> ' t go away . <continued_utterance> may i recommend this find cabernet ?
turn right at the next street .
bet the bureau ' s accusing you of the same thing in dallas .
how ' s that ?
so , what do ya think ?
i think i ' ll take some meatloaf .
there is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside . thousands of life forms all screaming me me me and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms . it ' s terrifying and exhausting .
well , i like the countryside .
in <person> ?
it ' s a special issue on home improvements and ways to beautify your home .
ah , <person> .
i ' m sorry , but who could prepare for something like this ? ! i ' ve got a complete winter wardrobe , it ' s just in delaware . and no , that doesn ' t make me a flake ! he unzips his suitcase . starts pulling out ragg socks , long- sleeve pullovers , etc .
not here . i ' ll call you and we ' ll rendezvous again . we have to leave separately , so we aren ' t seen together . for your safety .
you ' ll call me then ?
it can ' t be .
<person> thing happened to me with wife two . i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty . i mean empty . she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge . what kind of person would think of that ?
<person> -- ?
<person> sends his regrets but he had to take a trip .
<person> , it ' s too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i can ' t go <person> and i can ' t sneak , feel back enough as it is .
you feel bad about this ? about me ?
what did you say ?
edie <person> . she is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition . i requested she be put on the case personally . she flew out yesterday . <continued_utterance> no matter . <person> away , mr . mcmanus .
he ' s bluffing .
if i ' m lying , i ' m dying .
how ?
i don ' t know . my aunt used to use my uncle ' s old pajamas and a candle .
he hired you . that was a mistake .
<person> and i were friends from childhood . he was loyal , that ' s not a mistake .
call for you <person>dy .
<person> <person> .
she ' s very cute .
thanks . <person> , our six year old , is downstairs with <person> .
he didn ' t . he had it built .
whatever .
listen to me , cocksucker . there is no keyser sate . if you say his name again , i ' <number> kill you right here .
a strange threat . i can only assume you ' re here to kill me anyway . pity about mr . <person> . mcmanus fair trade for <person> . <continued_utterance> ahh , mr . <person> . do join us .
macready !
what ?
it ' s a pleasure to meet you .
he ' s spoken of you . he says you ' re becoming friends .
i know what i said but not now . you won it . <person> . you won it . when they give you the money , that means that you won . we don ' t want to go to court -- is this getting to you . ?
. he ' s a good man .
-- what happened ? !
i got into a fight in a bar down in florida . which i was not the one who instigated it , at all . but they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months . i didn ' t write you because i didn ' t want you to get all upset about it . i just figured you ' d figure i was on the road for a little while . i know it was stupid and i ' m sorry . i really didn ' t mean to make you worry . but you know what ? i can ' t run around all the time doin ' stuff or not doin ' stuff because it ' s gon na make you worry ! because then i come back here , and i tell you about my fuckin ' . traumas , and i get this wounded little `` i ' ve <person> '' bullshit , over and over again , and it really just -- cramps me ! like i just want to get out from under it ! . and here i am back in this fuckin ' hole explaining myself to you again !
<person> this sucker , eh ?
<person> , where ' d you get this ?
well . why do you think you ' re in this situation ?
with which one ?
and you moved to new york . to dance and paint and act and deal arms .
right . do you want to hear <person> . or <person> ?
i think they are deriving some good from the experience .
what are you doing here , <person> ? i expressly asked you not to come .
how ' s things , brian ?
<person> ' t flatter yourself . i ' m fine . <person> - sofia is great , but by no means one-of -- a-kind . she was a proximity infatuation . <continued_utterance> and don ' t use that , it ' s mine .
. i was one of a group of .
<person> affirmatively . <person> . keep those answers to three words . you weren ' t ' part of a group , ' you were her anesthesiologist . <person> ' t that right ?
i don ' t either , but it sure sells books . <continued_utterance> i was right about <person> . <person> ' t i , <person> ?
how ?
really . how wonderful for you .
yes . it was , actually .
my approach is to be suave and debonair and sophisticated .
come on , <person> . <number> , <number> , <number> spring . like we learned last time . <number> , <number> , <number> , spring .
<person> . i learned somethin interestin today on a science show i heard on the radio . how leeches is comin back into style .
say what ? honestly , sugar , you can talk more shit sometimes ?
huh .
before he can get there here comes this federal <person> , and <person> ' s indicted for jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he ' s gon na be disbarred , his life is over . <person> , gim me another drink . how are you ?
<person> ?
like you said , just got ta know how to handle ' em . <person> ' t up to it . we know that we ' re doin ' , <person> .
what the hell ' s going on ?
live execution .
must be a mistake .
says here you ' ve listened to it <number> times . <continued_utterance> is this true ? have you always wanted to be a cowboy ? <continued_utterance> you also got `` men without hats '' greatest hits ? i didn ' t know they qualified for a greatest hits album . can you break me off a little `` <person> '' ?
i just wan na --
do you know what you ' re doin ' ? just get outta here !
this is not going well .
<person> ! <person> will know what to do .
in other words , our scope is too narrow .
at our press conference tomorrow , i think we should announce our plans to explore the world . not just a few leggy <number> d ' s , with blond hair upstairs and down .
august ! <person> ! she was good ! she came back on her own ! besides , you can ' t do anything now ! the show is still going on .
<person> . the band will drown it out .
nothing . i think i twisted my -- <continued_utterance> i have to tell you something . something . . hard .
then stand up . i ' m too old for all this roiling around on the floor .
incredible . we should take a drive before they ' re gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
<person> for antiques .
<person> ' t we just dump him fast someplace ?
i want a place where only the vultures will find him . it ' ll be over soon , <person> .
since i supplied the cutters , the horse is mine . this is fair , no ?
in a pig ' s eye . he ' s english , plain to see .
she was with me .
you don ' t see what ' s going on here , do you ? there ' s four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas . <person> have been lost . no suspects have been named . so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . that the fbi didn ' t do its job .
like one of those `` national geographic '' specials with the topless chicks ?
whatever helps you cope .
<person> , i had no choice .
it ' s the most despicable thing i ' ve ever heard in my life . i mean , it ' s disgusting . guys shooting pool to determine my future .
trent preston .
what ' s he like ?
she looks . i would say she has a little of the coloring of that <person> person .
<person> of the bookstore .
getting back will therapeutic .
<person> just talk to me . just a little talk .
mr . <person> ?
she likes you , <person> .
it ' s okay . <continued_utterance> what ' s so funny ?
fred . the way he looked when you screamed at him .
i ' ve always maintained what this nation needs is a reliable timepiece . the navy needs one . the army needs one . - for the artillery you know . kemp couldn ' t do better , <person> . so that ' s why you ' ve been in hiding . - clever of you , indeed ! filby i don ' t believe <person> is referring to a new kind of timepiece .
when i speak of time , i ' m referring to the fourth dimension .
what ?
some fruit . <continued_utterance> no .
up yours .
<person> and defiant as always , <person> . it fits so well because you ' re obscene .
<person> ' <person> .
i ' ve heard that name before . are you a gascon ?
gave all that up . going into business .
well i ' m the man to see . <person> i ' m also tax collector , captain of the fire brigade , and chairman of the non-partisan anti- chinese league . a man of many parts . got a place to stay yet ? i also sit on the townlot commission . got a couple of lovely cottages coming up for <person> . here , let me show you .
so what ' s wrong with that ?
nothing . i just think it ' s unstructured .
the lazy fuck just didn ' t bother to look her up .
that sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai .
i ' m not . <continued_utterance> he ' s so . it ' s too much . and i can ' t . i can ' t breath .
who ? your husband ?
all implanted .
our friends . my work .
yes . i ' m sure he ' s hoping you ' ll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .
do you really think so ?
i have plenty of friends .
the hell you do .
<person> , sweetheart . <person> in love with you like i am brings out that ugly jealous side .
well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gon na get that <person> back here and away from that murderer .
then who goes ?
we all go . how about it , <person> ?
stand right here .
where ? <continued_utterance> you ' re acting like a crazy person .
well . i ' d like to think that love is a question of destiny , not chance .
for a moment there you just reminded me of somebody . <continued_utterance> he had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he ' d completely avoided the truth . his entire life was wrapped up in deception . he told so many lies , i wouldn ' t believe him even if he finally did tell the truth .
we run they ' ll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we ' re americans they might get scared , think we ' re part of a detachment and keep on going .
they ' re not going to --
<person> , we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational . the other options . <continued_utterance> . do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee . however , the more time that goes by , the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes .
mr . president , the motto i chose for sac is ' <person> is our profession . ' <person> forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange . but if launched , those missiles in cuba would kill a lot of americans . that ' s why i ' m being such a pain in the ass about destroying them . destroying them immediately . <person> , even mac agrees .
he just had two .
give me two more . <continued_utterance> <person> sesame .
no letter ? no wire ?
why ? would you have answered it ?
i already called pomeranz and switched it to wednesday .
i hope that shrew at the front desk gave you shit about it .
oh , yeah ? well , if you hadn ' t shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
<person> ' t talk to me about importance . because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy . <continued_utterance> right now , poised at the edge of the galaxy , <person> has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet . i alone have information that reveals this weapon ' s only weakness . and you , my friend , are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with <person> .
yes . now i talked to <person> and there ' s a guy , this pakistani guy down in <person> .
<person> ?
<person> and <person> . that ' s very interesting .
my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?
-- no . no offense to the old man . i appreciate you trying to help . but i put my ass on the line coming out here , man .
what ' d you expect to hear ?
no . no . i ' ll see you in about four hours .
do you love me ?
of course we are .
they didn ' t want me when i was born . why should i care .
a fucking moron .
huh . i guess i just wish they made them like they used to . you know , something like
<person> , you ' re wrong ! she went to new york because she ' s so in love with someone here she just couldn ' t stand it .
<person> . i ' m darned if i can figure out why .
in new york ?
what ?
blocked .
ah . i don ' t believe in writer ' s block .
i have to go to work .
now who ' s the coward ?
no one seems to know where you live , <person> . <person> thought you ' d like my couch .
and . and before that . did i do anything ? anything bad ?
hello .
god , i ' ve been calling you .
i stopped by your place the other day .
<person> mentioned .
yeah , this insurance business is too slow for me . i ' m going to go down and try my hand at jai alai .
jai alai ?

but should you be saying that in front of him ? nader ?
i can see that .

i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble . he stares right at magneto .
but you know that it is a war , old friend . and to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs , by any means necessary . and for that reason , i will always have the advantage . no matter how you trap me , how i am contained - chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation
he doesn ' t have a choice .
oh , i disagree .
<person> . can you hear me ? you are fucked . there ' s no way out of this . if you won ' t listen to your own laws , then listen to this : this is president <person> . this nation does not want your sympathy . you can not use this reservation as a sanctuary . stop where you are now . <continued_utterance> whatever you are trying to do is futile , <person>mond . you have nothing . nothing . <person> picks up the mic as he cranes to keep an eye on the rearview .

hardly . i analyze everything to death . every time a guy smiles at me , i ask myself is he really smiling or is he just orally fixated ? when i smile back , i wonder , am i really attracted or just smiling out of some residual cro-magnon instinct ? if i ever actually have sex , i ' m not sure i ' ll know the difference between an orgasm and an anxiety attack !
i have the same problem .
<person> .
<person> , i appreciate , you know , the concern and all , but like he said , i can take care of myself .

that ' s not the way it looked to me . <person> to me like you was trying to make time with her .
<person> time ? is everybody in this town on drugs ?

may i advise you ? <continued_utterance> she scares me too . as do all women who join beauty to intelligence . what ' s a man to do ?
i have no idea .
characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . x-ray vision , things of that sort .
<person> , i don ' t want to play this game anymore .
the island is cursed .
we ' ve traveled a long way . we ' re looking for <person> .
no .
who was it ?
only from time to time , which is unusual .
what is it ?
fish eyes ?
even if it offended someone , i wouldn ' t eat a fish eye .
hey , you know what ? can i be honest with you ? right now i ' m not all that interested in how you ' re messed up ' cause you didn ' t get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday . what i ' m interested in is how i can keep from getting dead . and listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasn ' t good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a kennedy doesn ' t do a damn thing to help keep me alive . so do me a favor ; either shut up , or . just shut up . <person> isn ' t sure what to say .
<person> .
oh ? why not ?
dr . <person> ' s on vacation .
he ' ll be with you when he ' s available .
you expelled , too ?
anything .
i want you to go . i want you get away from us , from the show . you ' re smart <person> . you deserve better than us . leave as soon as you can or something terrible ' s going to happen .
no . maybe i believe <person> has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself . maybe i believe the journey , the big adventure , never ends . he kneels on the floor . puts his head on her pillow next to hers . <continued_utterance> maybe i believe <person> sent you to me because i am ill . to help me through . <continued_utterance> i want to go home .
i ' ll talk to your father .
just pick up your money and go .
<person> , are we cross ?
of course . of course ! where ? can ' t i bring it to you ? for god ' s sake , baby , please , just tell me what ' s happened , what could possibly be so bad ?
<person> ? <continued_utterance> do you love me ?
i was asking to do the new york- washington shuttle for a few months .
oh , and he said ' no , ' huh ?
i thought you came to break bread over a thousand days ?
that too .
i was thinking about it . you put me out of business --
i know that --
how ' s he going to want the gold ? he couldn ' t even know we had it .
he . he could have been watching us .
<person> , please .
<person> was so strong back then . working from the crack of dawn . so proud of his peaches .
<person> . whatever you say . i ' m crazy , i ' m blind .
no , you ' re not blind . you ' re just drinking <person> . and when you drink <person> , you start . in with that <person> , `` she shot . me down , '' gim me a cigarette , king of sad thing .
i guess this means they ' re not being expelled .
no , apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent .
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
my sweet clever <person> , so that ' s why you ' re not wearing a bustle .
i was wrong .
<person> un <person> . [ `` <person> un <person> saage die <person> '' `` children and fools say the truth '' amish expressions ]
and i love you , too . but don ' t wear my stuff .
why do you do it , <person> ?
you loved me once , you must have --
that you was a liar . who you are now i don ' t even know .
he ' s a nice guy , isn ' t he ?
well that ' s what i ' m trying to figure out . how long have you known him ?
nonetheless , from the mental aspect -- which is my domain -- you have regressed and are fumbling somewhere between delusion and denial .
' regression , delusion , denial ' ? you got ta use all this psychological language ?
it can help them regain lost strength .
yes .
you don ' t have to agree with me , <person> ; but i think i ' ve been a bit of a schmuck lately .
i agree . go thou and sin no more .
no . where ?
over there .
where ' s <person> ?
that ' s where i live . and i want to get back there so badly i ' m going all the way to <person> to get the wizard of oz to help me .
. and someone else ' s .
we share an eye for human frailty and we ' re both born blackmailers <person> . i knew young stemmons here had a fondness for lads , stretching back to his days at the academy .
you ever put your hands on me again and you ' ll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades , <person> .
you didn ' t tell me about <person> --
yes . <continued_utterance> she was damaged and unstable . the more i tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house .
how did she know where it was ? <continued_utterance> our dream house .
so you know your way around . we can hide out .
maybe . but it seems i have some enemies i didn ' t know i had . `` death to <person> . `` how ' d you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming , `` death to <person> '' ?
does what ?
why don ' t you go home to the old lady
hey man , back the fuck up . to this place . what ' s that shit ? right now , all over this country , a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see , you got any drugs ? you know where i can get drugs ? what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person , on their possibilities ? if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood , indian hills , and they asked every white person they saw , hey , you got any drugs ? , within a day , your friends and their kids would be selling . it ' s market forces , man . the product ' s marked up three hundred percent . you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day . you think white people would still be going to law school ?
you ' re starting to piss me off . get out of the car .
yeah , they ' re bad for your health . i ' m tryin ' to look out for you .
that ' s cop bullshit .
you know , even when i think about your face i get happier .
do you want to talk ?
i ' m in kinship . <person> , <person> , there ' s some things we need to talk about .
you ' re in kinship ?
and number two ?
if you think we ' re going to have some kind of ' life affirming ' romance here just because we cheated death , let me be clear : we ' re going to have it where i want , and when i want .
about nine more hours .
we can ' t learn anything from this .
<person> ? does he wear pants this color ?

i don ' t know , <person> . i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow . leave the t . v . on , sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off .
what ' s happened ?
what we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else .
in order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick .
four o ' clock . <person> ' t be late .
<person> tien , chien-penny .

the world of games is in a kind of a trance . people are programmed to accept so little , but the possibilities are so great . <continued_utterance> you probably thought that tonight , we were going to test a new game that i designed . <continued_utterance> but there is no new game to test , at least , not in the usual sense . <continued_utterance> no , no , it ' s going to be much better than you expected , because existenz is not just a game . it ' s an entirely new game system . <person> research and i developed it together - the existenz system by <person> - and it involves a whole lot of new toys , which you are going to be the first to try out .
metaflesh . <continued_utterance> written like this . one word . <person> , capital f . metaflesh is what our new toys are made of - the metaflesh game-pod , only from <person> research . it connects with any industry standard bioport , which i know you all have or you wouldn ' t be here . . using , however , a very non- standard connecting device which we call . <continued_utterance> . we call an umbycord . spelled like this . <continued_utterance> i guess you can tell i started off as a schoolteacher .
now i ' m the one who ' s nauseous . so what ' s the deal ? what do you need me for ?
there ' s some folks i want to keep tabs on . <person> , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people .
hey , you ' re the pain-in-the-ass ! first you dump a baby on us , then you scare everyone away from the party , then .
i scared everyone aw . just cut the crap , will you ? my whole life is diapers , shuttles and bottles . i do the graveyard shift , i ' m the one who never gets any sleep . i .
great job you got .
well . i like it . because even in this little town , i feel like what i do is very connected with the real center of people ' s lives . i ' m not saying i ' m always mr . <person> , but i don ' t feel like my life is off to the side of what ' s important . you know ? i don ' t feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people . i don ' t feel like a negligible little scrap , floating around in some kind of empty void , with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies i can scrape together on my own .
yeah . it should be fun . you wan na come ?
not this time .
uh . hi , <person> . what are you doing here ?
<person> ' t ya heard . we ' re gon na be roommates ! <person> ' t that zinky ?
for the first time in my life , i have no idea what i ' m supposed to do .
anyone who ' s ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don ' t know where the hell they are .
<person> ' t say that . we don ' t know that for sure .
who else could it have been ? it was probably around <number> --
kind of a mean place to be . <person> cold , unfriendly .
excuse me . <continued_utterance> <person> ? . <continued_utterance> . no , i just got in . i don ' t know if i can . <person> , i can ' t talk now . can i call you back ? . <person> . <person> . she hangs up the phone , stands and turns back toward the door . <person> is standing right behind her .
he wrote obscene words on the wall .
what obscene words ?
faisil . you ' re new on <person> ' s team , aren ' t you ?
yes .
yes , that ' s correct .
. there are notations every thirty seconds .
right there in liberty city . and you were right , she ' s really something .
so she hasn ' t changed ?
yes . the ghost . <continued_utterance> i thought it was mrs . <person> , but it ' s not .
stop .
i wish you well , <person> .
<person> at us . i ' m frozen , and you ' re dead . and i love you .
really ?
i think so . maybe .
what was ?
to jump all over you when i ' m the one who ' s really . oh , <person> , i don ' t know how to say this --
we were just saying that this baby ' s conversation is actually rather limited . and a touch annoying . <person> ' t you think ?
well , she ' s not the only one with a limited conversation . at least she has an excuse , she ' s a baby ! what ' s yours ?
technically and biologically , though he ' ll never recover .
how can this be ?
you making your own fire ?
no , arrows . we ' re going to need them .
<person> ?
yeah , i think it ' s that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint . <person> at this .
why ? why not ? where are you goin ' ?
<person> , i ' m goin ' home . to bed . my nice warm bed .
it ' ll prove to her that i ' m not who she thinks i am .
but you are who she thinks you are ! <person> , i don ' t bet on a horse with a hard-on .
let ' s just say i ' m freelancing and leave it at that .
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don ' t say much .
why couldn ' t she sell that way too ?
because she ' s small and we ' re big . how about we go get some candy ?
where ' s he going ?
oh , he ' s just had to go somewhere , dad . do you want some juice ?
is that <person> desmond ' s vehicle ?
yep , it sure is .
oh my goodness . do you see what i see ?
president of the <person> . <continued_utterance> he ' s a boxer . a flyweight .
<person> , i know i ' m not perfect , and i may have made a few wrong turns , but you have to understand -- i ' m a chosen . that ' s a lot of responsibility -- you can ' t even imagine .
the only one who thinks you ' re chosen is you , so shut up already !
do you have another room to put it in ?
i have ceased to exist .
so now you can go ! oh . oh ! i am so damn glad to get out of this place ! i ' ll be in ' fourth form . ' <person> ' t that sound great ? and if you get a two-bedroom place in d . c . , i can come for vacations and summers . i ' m out . i ' m out ! <continued_utterance> what ? oh , don ' t cry -- he ' s not worth it . <continued_utterance> she holds <person> at arm ' s length and studies him .
my you ' ve grown , haven ' t you .
<person> !
it ' s so nice you could join us on such late notice .
well , listen , mrs . <person> , umm .
<person> , mrs . <person> .
chief <person> , u . s . attorney <person> has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the federal grand jury on- -<person> , this brilliant rebuke:
-welles <person> is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail , for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the los angeles police department . <continued_utterance> now if you ' ll excuse me , i ' ll leave you with <person> .
she ' s the worst combination : stunning looks and a brilliant mind .
if she ' s so smart , how did she get caught up with <person> ?
who . are . you ?
i ' m sofia .
i don ' t know . a map map .
a map map . woods pulls out a map and hands it to <person> .
<person> , can ' t you help me ? i ' m all alone .
tell you what . if this guy calls you again --
one hundred . ninety-nine . ninety-eight . ninety-seven . ninety-six . ninety-five . his voice drops off ; his eyes close . lull studies him , adjusts some instruments , then turns to <person> , glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her .
<person> , <person> , the trip to <person> ; number sixty-two . and throw in that blonde . we ' ll give him a real good time .
please . i won ' t hang on you . as soon as we get there you can dump me . i don ' t care . i just want to get out of here .
<person> , baby , i <continued_utterance> you don ' t have any money put away , do you ?
like ? uh . hmmm . well .
i got this guy who should know tells me buy <person> but i been burned on tips . what do you think <person> ?
he ' s bunking with you .
<person> !
where are you , <person> ?
i ' m in the vending room .
what do you think they were fighting about ? <person> don ' t fancy dope-pushing wetbacks .
what about the son ?
not his own . the children had been dead for several hours .
<person> .
mr . mcavoy , i can appreciate that you have a fairly laid-back , relaxed lifestyle -- but i have hours to keep .
a former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of pisces -- something about floating through the universe --
a new extraterrestrial biological entity .
my god .
<person> technical finish , but come on , that ' s a fluke .
you call it a fluke . i call it a guy maintaining composure and waiting for his opportunity .
<person> .
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn ' t get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
why ?
i ' m better than that .
like if something happened to him , he could still get us .
like how ?
if i am going to get through math today , you ' re going to have to bring me up to speed quick .
you didn ' t do your homework ?
i told her i would if she would give me time .
i bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
i am worried about the king ' s .
what do you mean ?
how ' d i do that ?
you ain ' t thinking about shanking , you ain ' t thinking about the doctor lady , you ain ' t thinking period . you just lookin ' like a fool and hittin ' it pure -- your natural state .
this attitude ' s not gon na help him any , is it ?
i got greedy . i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off . that was my mistake . <person> would never be so stupid .
<person> , <person> . we ain ' t doing odd jobs anymore . we ' re headed for <person> permanent .
oh , sure . . my god , you really are !
sometimes , i like being part machine . <continued_utterance> why didn ' t you tell me you had a daughter ?
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
force equals mass times acceleration . we got it .
<person> . the third law --
<person> . <person> . we have to help storm we have to .
iandiacute ; ll go back , but first let me find you a safe place . <person> extends his hand . logan here , take my hand . <person> looks at <person> confused . <person> grows impatient . logan take it !
tail him ?
no . let him get comfortable . let him believe me .
what do you mean ?
it had a very strong , very real anti-game theme . i mean , it began with the assassination of a game designer .
that ' s about all it ' s good for . that ' s the one to have . <continued_utterance> the windward passage . i crewed on that one summer . long time ago .
you know , i want to thank you for getting me into this class . no way was my old man going to spring for the fees .
well , i ' ll be .
so what ' s your next move , <person> ?
what was that ?
my office was on the other side of the building back then . you don ' t remember me do you ? <continued_utterance> i had red hair . <continued_utterance> i think you were a little younger than <person> when it happened . did you know we changed the conduct rules of the pool because of you ? <continued_utterance> the kids still talk about it like some ghost story . `` did you know there was a kid that almost drowned in the pool ? he got pneumonia and almost died . `` the nurse shakes her head . <continued_utterance> we let them tell it . it helps keep them safe . <continued_utterance> are you still phobic of water ?
i didn ' t do that .
who did ? mrs . <person> ?
what makes sense , is all .
dont do this , <person>or , please .
i want to make it up to you .
thanks , buddy , buddy , i ' m back . <person> , <person> , those optorectomies do work wonders .
thank you .
<person> .
oh , fine . she wasn ' t feeling so great .
that ' s too bad .
i don ' t know . i just want to get out of this town . and if you ' ve got any sense when you get old enough you ' ll get out of here too . your mom ' s gon na live in this town for the rest of her life , and you know why ? because she thinks she has to . <person> ' t ask me why , but that ' s the truth . she thinks there ' s all these things she has to do , but you want to know one thing about your mom ? she ' s a bigger fuck- up than i ever was . i mean , i know i messed up . you think i enjoy getting thrown in jail because i wanted you to face that prick your dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he is ? i know i got a little carried away , and i lost my temper just a little bit -- which is not the end of the world either , by the way , just for future reference -- and now she ' s kickin ' me out of my own house because -- you know , because i fucked up a little bit . which i totally admit . i was like -- totally ready to admit that .
i could go with you .
well . at least now you know .
i think it was better when i didn ' t . it was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world . as <person> dwells on this , <person> bursts out laughing . <continued_utterance> what ' s so funny ?
you ' ll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns .
then shoot them also .
and are they going to get it ?
they might . yes . that ' s the point . is that they might . you see , the jury wants to believe . they ' re all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . i ' m going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it ' s written on their face , ' this is a sham . there is no justice . ' but in their heart they ' re saying , ' maybe . maybe . '
what do you make of all this ?
it doesn ' t quite add up . <continued_utterance> the infrared satellite images . no heat , no flame , no explosion . if that boat went down where they said it did , there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface .
it has worked .
i ' m talking about dna samples , fiber optics , search parties , they got infrared scanners , fbi scientists . they figure this shit out . they always figure it out .
i had to inspect the merchandise first .
of course .
what did it look like ? <continued_utterance> there were bees . and corn crops . <continued_utterance> what are they ?
what do you think ?
my men are dead , and i have no casket . you are a deceiver .
you have no idea what i am . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> .
the `` real '' stuff ? . you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies ?
no , c ' mon !
i just won an event the other night .
ah , you won an event . that ' s what this is . let me guess , it was in a parking lot . dj from the local radio station . couple of ring card girls you wouldn ' t bang on a dare . am i right ?
<person> . <person> to meet ya .
you are from new orleans , <person> ?
very well . i won ' t discuss it any further with you . will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are ?
what for ?
it should be in the bathroom .
well it should be but it ' s not !
cut him loose ?
when we were up poking around his place . i found this . <continued_utterance> . it was stashed in his old coal furnace . wind must have dislodged it . i don ' t think he saw me find it . <continued_utterance> . <person> sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back . cut him loose .
dad . <continued_utterance> so serious .
<person> , <person> is not punishing you . no <person> i know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer .
get the first aid kit . <continued_utterance> come on , big guy . do me a favor and don ' t be dead , okay ? open your eyes and look at me .
wow . does he need cpr ? because i know cpr .
are you expecting someone ?
who would i be expecting here ?
i . i can ' t , <person> .
what ? ! ? but , sheeni . i just don ' t get it . i ' m here . <person> ' s here too .
<person> , son , this ' ll only hurt for a second .
no , no , please !
they still have to take it to a jury .
what i ' m saying , they ' re getting some help .
because you ' re right . it ' s taken so many generations for your people to get to this point . you ' re nearly there . you just need someone to show you how close you really are . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> . <continued_utterance> look -- your ancestors called it magic . you call it science . i come from a place where they ' re one and the same thing .
what is it ?
there is nothing wrong with the work i do here . i have been doing just fine , the whole time before you came here -- and if you think that riding people in this petty , ridiculous way is the way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else i think you ' re out of your mind !
i didn ' t say there was . could i please -- could i please -- may i respond ?
is he talking ?
he regained consciousness less than an hour ago . he spoke - not english - then he lapsed .
i can ' t feel my hands . <continued_utterance> i ' m serious --
he ' s blue . he isn ' t breathing --
this is serious . mr . <person> ' s got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself . <person> , you first . <continued_utterance> hyggelig a mote dem . <person> .
hyggelig a mote dem . jeg heter <person> palmer .
<person> like a french word , what is it ?
it ' s a romantic and tragic drink .
you should have taken their offer . especially if you were unprepared .
i had a witness disappear on me .
we were together before .
believe me , i ' m really sorry i can ' t recall the details of that encounter .
<person> , i ' ve been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you ' re becoming the queen of hot and cold .
you ' d never understand .
just notes . about work-
-what `work ' ?
coming about , sir .
orders from london : for the next ninety-six hours , we ' re to run on full radio silence . double watches , full alert . we ' re to send one encrypted positioning burst to london every six hours - otherwise , zero electronic emissions . the first officer nods . captain inform the men , then run a surprise inspection . if someone paints us , i don ' t want this ship showing up on their radar screen like some god-damned harrod ' s <person> tree .
how ' d you know it was him ?
he looked exactly the same as his high school yearbook picture , which happens to be the last photograph ever taken of him .
so . any decisions ? or -- do you still want to think about it some more . ?
well -- i mean -- i don ' t know , <person> . i mean , we haven ' t exactly been going steady the last few months , if you know what i mean --
why ? so i can wind up like you ? what ' s the point ?
did i tell you about the time we first met ? <continued_utterance> you were quite young at the time . all wet and still attached to your mom by a cord . you opened your eyes and looked right at me . and i knew then i would always love you with all my heart . <continued_utterance> somewhere along the way i got lost , honey . i forgot about what was really important . i ' m sorry pump -- i mean -- <continued_utterance> <person> , regarding this singing -- she pulls back , suddenly wary . oh shit . <continued_utterance> you were pretty good .
you ever fought before ?
yeah .
i like your cheekbones . <person> , are you all right ?
this is a face made for television .
and ask me what ?
who put my client in the hospital for life .
it seems - mr . <person> - that <person> has told me the most incredible story : a sunken british warship filled with gold ; a british cutter firing on her ; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the strait . <continued_utterance> obviously , the british government denies all of this -
- i told you ! he was there ! -
who ' s stuck with my wife . you or me ?
you want me to believe that you were setting me up with your wife as some kind of decoy ?
. when tonight they ' ll probably be keeping us awake .
but what if something happens ?
fewer than half .
i want these people in the cottages , not in the inn . it ' s safer .
thank you , dear .
no dogs at the table .
i told you to slow down . <person> , <person> , i told her to slow down .
about how fast was i going ?
for the league of <person> ?
you created quite a stir . not sure you ' ll be asked back .
the story of my life .
shall we try it over again ?
<person> for <person> .
for me ? what is it ?
yup . and now i ' m gon na change hers .
but wait . why did you install a bad port into me ?
what do you want me to do about it ?
i want you to take care of <person> , so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again .
what ?
i saw him .
<person> thing happened to me with wife two . i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty . i mean empty . she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge . what kind of person would think of that ?
i still don ' t believe it .
damn it , quit the bickering and give me a hand . wheel that fibrillator over here . <continued_utterance> palmer , turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face . childs , grab his shoulders .
you ' re going to have to sleep sometime .
yup .
<person> ' s do this .
what you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up <person> ' ass , eh ? do what i say or i quit .
<person> , okay .
<person> did your people get into <person> ?
the house of odin is full of traitors .
i ' ve come to say goodbye , and thank you .
you found him ?
a dead body . that ' s so sad . but you fell in love . that ' s so great .
oh . one other thing .
it ' s never going to get to that . the store is fine .
i don ' t even know why you would say that ?
friend of yours ?
hello , little baby .
this is an outrage <person> ! you ' re full of shit !
one thing i do know is this paper company lost $ <number> million last year , and i ' d bet half of that is in the paperwork going back and forth between all the vice presidents . the new law of evolution in corporate america seems to be ' survival of the unfittest ' . well in my book , you either do it right or you get eliminated . <person> is doomed to fail . its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked . its crown jewels are its trees , the rest is dross . through wars , depressions , inflations and deterioration of paper money , trees have always kept their value , but <person> is chopping them all down . forests are perishable , forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet , and all the illusory maginot lines , scorched earth tactics , proxy fights , poison pills , etc . that mr . <person> is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying <person> are doomed to fail because the bottom line , ladies and gentlemen , as you very well know , is the only way to stay strong is to create value , that ' s why you buy stock , to have it go up . if there ' s any other reason , i ' ve never hear it . that ' s all i ' m saying . it ' s you people who own this company , not them , they work for you and they ' ve done a lousy job of it . <person> rid of them fast , before you all get sick and die . i may be an opportunist , but if these clowns did a better job , i ' d be out of work . in the last seven deals i ' ve been in , there were <number> . <number> million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $ <number> billion . when i bought the ixtlan corporation it was in the exact same position <person> is today -- i turned three of its companies private and i sold four others -- and each of these companies , liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered . i am not a destroyer of companies , i am a liberator of them . the point is , ladies and gentlemen , greed is good . greed works , greed is right . greed clarifies , cuts through , and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit . greed in all its forms , greed for life , money , love , knowledge , has marked the upward surge of mankind -- and greed , mark my words -- will save not only <person> but that other malfunctioning corporation called the usa . thank you .
t-h-o-r . and your relationship to him ?
i ' ve never met him before .
real good , <person> . but maybe you better let me take over .
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage . <continued_utterance> you think you could get away with this ? hah ! we toons may be idiotic , but we ' re not stupid !
i didn ' t mean to liz . i ' m sorry .
you can ' t play around with these tent people .
maybe a road or route number ?
<person> .
<person> ' t play games with me , ted .
i don ' t know , maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a labrador .
to pick up <person> .
well . do you not even want me to visit now ? ' <person> i can catch the bus at five o ' clock if that ' s what you want .
i have no quarrel with you . but she ' s a lady . you should be more respectful .
and you should shut the hell up , princess .
yeah . yeah . what about the hor . ?
that ' s how they get you ! they ' re under the goddamn <continued_utterance> sons of bitches ! <continued_utterance> it ' s gaining on us ! !
. when the going gets tough , the , the , the , whirrrrrrrrrrr , the , the .
<person> ? <person> ? <person> , <person> -- the tape ' s jammed !
are you sure ?
yes ! <person> ! she lives out on that island ! madmartigan lets out a sarcastic , sceptical laugh .
i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry i forgot the tent . i don ' t think i forgot anything else .
i bet you didn ' t forget the bachelor party checks .
<person> . <person> ' s go rescue him .
<person> idea . <person> . only one problem . i don ' t know where they live .
really ?
yeah , that ' s right . you wan na come in and shake it for me ?
<person> , right .
no , it is . <person> , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it ' s not because you ' re a space ranger , pal , it ' s because you ' re a toy ! you are his toy .
i don ' t have too many fish fries left .
we can have it here next week .
trust me , i understand . i just want to say something to you , <person> .
<person> ?
you ' ll have forty-eight hours to complete the transfer . <person> ' t waste our time .
<person> ' t dream of it . i ' m even gon na throw in a few extra bucks to send you to charm school .
yeah . he ' s an animal . he prints money . come on , let ' s finish strong .
hold up !
<person> . he was operating hector-
-don ' t worry about dan <person> . you deal directly with me . now go out the back . i don ' t want the press recognizing you .
no . i ' d want a public phone .
well . the store at saltzburg . but you won ' t be going to saltzburg for a while .
la train . at one-thirty , and we have to pack .
<person> ?
how do you know where i work ?
i been here almost a week .
i don ' t care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
it ' s only a tale .
nothing ' s going to happen . besides , i have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . i ' ve got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is .
i know .
i think so .
i ' ve been looking for that flash and i look and i look and i can ' t find it . and what if i already had it ? you know . my moment ? what if it ' s gone ? and i never saw it ? you ' re getting married , man . that ' s a fucking beautiful thing . just a beautiful thing . i just can ' t stop breaking beautiful things .
just when i think there ' s hope for you .
what ?
you mean the brother gregory in princeton who never calls you ?
he wrote me .
are you solid with that ?
no . i think it ' s fucked .
that must come in handy .
dear , <person> .
i don ' t believe you !
no , i ' m afraid it ' s true . there ' s no other <person> except me .
i got every shot in the book .
i said you don ' t got the game .
even if i knew i wouldn ' t tell you . you do not want to come into contact with these people . only <person> knows who they are . that ' s his real asset . <person> doesn ' t know them . they don ' t know <person> . <person> and state .
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
i frankly don ' t know what you mean .
i mean , i ' ve been listening to your pompous drivel about the latest trends for the last two hours , and frankly , it ' s a crock of horseshit .
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio , didn ' t you ?
yeah . sure did .
<person> , you ' re making more problems than you are sales .
i don ' t think you ' re being fair , sir . you assigned me this guy , and you know he ' s got a history .
i think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn ' t understand is not saving his soul . when he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion , that will be better . it will be his intellectual decision .
is that the way your parents raised you ?
so why would <person> want to help my father move to <person> ?
i told you , darling . <person> harbors you no ill will . i will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter .
i read , <person> .
remember that upside down flag back at <person> ' s house ? somebody took it down .
yes . everything .
then you ' re safe . if he wanted to break in , he wouldn ' t be calling you .
um . yes .
i ' ve seen you . from the window .
come on ! you getting in ?
i sense a conspiracy .
i don ' t remember seeing that .
it ' s been there forever . it was my granny ' s .
of course . our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary <person> sees fit to satisfy . <continued_utterance> with the caveat that it is not made public in any way , shape or form . and we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest . i can not stress this point enough .
<person> .
go !
okay .
well -- i don ' t know .
i don ' t know . <person> , i love you . i wish i could say it in a more interesting way . i just -- i love you .
yeah : you didd ' t used to give a shit before , but dow it docks you out .
before what ?
i don ' t know where he is .
but . if you had to guess ?

<person> ! too bad he didn ' t make it .
not everybody was lucky .
and find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the humvee , and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off , but that ' s about it .

you taking the order wouldn ' t have changed anything .
they don ' t know that . we were the only one ' s on deck . <person> , there ' s nothing they can do to me right ? i ' m a kid .
unbearable , i ' d imagine .
i guess everything we ' ve got to lose is already gone anyway .
then you ' re only a hundred-forty-five in the hole . you can keep that dollar . now why don ' t you just take your american express gold card , and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split .

<person> , that ' s not really value added .
<person> , <person> , i ' m serious here . i need some distraction in my life right now . all i do is sit in my condo and think about <person> and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi i paid for . it ' s fucking unhealthy . i ' ve been really kind of going crazy . really .

let ' s go !
if we see a thief or a pickpocket , we just slap him around -- maybe cut off a finger or an ear , or the tip of his nose , lower lip -- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion -- then we take our share of the loot and let him go . mostly what we worry about are activist types , rabble rousers , getting people all riled up against the king or the temple priests .
pretty harsh , isn ' t it ?
i ' m sorry , sir , that line seems to be disconnected .
why don ' t i get a recording ?
you didn ' t have to come with me , you know . i didn ' t ask you to come .

really .
i hope this thing doesn ' t plummet to the basement .
no . i don ' t want freedom . i want a marriage . i want a life with you .
i can ' t imagine what you think that life is going to be .
it wasn ' t constructed for its aesthetic values , you know , but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter . now go on .
but i ' m perfectly comfortable and i find your store magnificent . what splendid achievements , what gigantic strides mankind has taken , what .
that ' s why you never had a bioport . you were one of them .
i still am one of them .
if i ever get my hands on the guy that made that call .
<person> , it wasn ' t a prank . i know that voice .

but i ' m really not here to try to get you to do anything , or to believe anything . and i ' ll tell you the same thing i told her , which is that as far as i ' m concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you , by the way she lives her life . <continued_utterance> and that doesn ' t mean she ' s supposed to be a saint , either , if that ' s what you ' re smiling about .
i didn ' t realize i was smiling .

ahh . dope-wise , this place sucks . <person> fuckin ' coons around here , eh ?
i thought you were fighting for the government ?
a man like <person> ' s got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he can ' t ever fill it . he can ' t kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it . and it drives him mad .
so what does he want ?
you underestimate me , brooks .
no . you underestimate these grass niggers . they ' re killing each other . that ' s all they do . get drunk and kill each other . then cover for each other . who gives a damn really as long as they stay on their reservation . you ask me , the government shouldn ' t care one particle .

we leave them in the shell .
why don ' t you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it . all right ?
if i ' m going to order , at least i ought to be content with my food .
you ' re going to arrest me for breaking and entering ?

luck . <person> . without meaning . <continued_utterance> three years ago , my cousin died on a plane that crashed on take off at philadelphia international airport . do you remember that crash ? <continued_utterance> i prayed and prayed and finally found some meaning in the event . it gave me peace . and then not quite a year later , an entire family from my parish burned to death in a hotel fire downtown . again i prayed . again i found meaning . just two days ago , my nephew rode with you on that train back from new york . he was traveling alone for the first time . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry if i can ' t react to your survival with the appropriate ' it was the hand of god . it was a miracle . ' kind of answer . i ' m fresh out of those right now . <person> is shaken . <person> . <person> metal of the watch i was wearing was crushed like a sledge hammer hit it . <continued_utterance> my twelve year old nephew ' s neck was broken in four places . what ' s your point ? you were chosen ? i don ' t think so .

he ' s got to be collared .
no , you can ' t . <person> , you ' re scaring him , dad . you ' re scaring him . he . <continued_utterance> he can ' t take a plow !
that ' s pride and vanity that talks ! not leadership ! have you forgotten everything i ' ve taught you ? what of a warrior ' s patience , cunning ?
while you wait and be patient , the nine realms laugh at us ! the old ways are done . you ' d stand giving speeches while <person> falls !
why ? would you have answered it ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
oh , so it ' s <person> ' s ?

you know why . you already said .
what ' d i say again ?
it ' s a picture of joey . well , i never !
and there ' s a letter .
but you was going to fight for me .
i wasn ' t going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .
i was thinking , <person> , maybe .
i love <person> . maybe i ' ll come visit you .
you needn ' t have troubled yourself .
no you ' re not . - you ' ve been behaving oddly for over a month now . i ' m not leaving until you tell me what ' s on your mind .
<person> ' t talk that way to me !

<person> steps to the hall . <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s the catskills , isn ' t it ?
<person> , it ' s ugly . even for a game- pod .
i have a terrible urge to port into it . what about you ?
<person> .
that ' s right .
maybe .
does it have something to do with another guy ? are you in love with him ?
should i be nervous for <person> ? `cause i am . i want to stop the fight before it even begins .
gentlemen , you ready ? you ready ? let ' s go to war !
hey ! there ' s fascists and then there ' s fascists , right ? be careful how you throw words like that around .
we don ' t have any pictures of rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is , and anybody crazy enough to go after him . <continued_utterance> . is liable to get his nuts shot off . <continued_utterance> <person> , well g ' bye . who the fuck are you ?
and i am --
we know who you are , <person> . why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world ?
yes , sir .
well , take them through again .
it ' s your radiator hose . it ' s busted .

<person> , if you read it it must be true .
<person> ! <person> , tell him . you know this stuff .
well the hood ain ' t too lively at the moment . <continued_utterance> whoever it is , tell ' em i ' m in houston on business .
<person> ! what you doing in town ?
quite the opposite , in fact .
old friend ?
how do you know i took it ? how do you know they didn ' t just give it to me ?
there ' s two girls out there that had a chance , they had a chance . ! and you blew it for ' em . now they ' ve gotten in some serious trouble , some very serious trouble and for at least part of it , i ' m gon na hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them . i ' ve got no feelin ' for you . but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat ' s ass what happens to them and you ' re either gon na tell me every damn thing you know , so there ' s a small chance i can actually do them some good , or i ' m gon na be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life . your misery is gon na be my goddamn mission in life . that ' s a sincere promise . <continued_utterance> now , for one thing , you violated your parole two days out . and you know judge <person> . he hates this sort of thing . once he gets wind of this , he ' s gon na blow sky high . and then when he finds out that you ' re a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery , well , i think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight , don ' t you ?
she ' s asian . they don ' t have jews in asia .
that is absolutely not true .
i mean it ' s open . anyone ' s got a shot at it . you just got ta get past a local and a sectional qualifier , and unlike doral or colonial or the a . t . t . , they can ' t keep you out . they can ' t ask you if you ' re a garbageman or a bean- picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper . you qualify , you ' re in .
and then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated --
i thought it was <person> tailing me .
<person> ' s greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side .
not yet .
have you asked her out ?
doing some ad hoc dope seizures for <person> . still love taking the occasional door down .
you were born for the street fritz . i never featured you for the suit and tie set .

a surprise ?
how does a terrorist like <person> supply his men with state-of-the-art russian army weapons ?
what ? this is not possible .
we got the smoke .
roll it .
that ' s because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
<person> , if that ' s what you think , i must ' ve really screwed up my job as a father .
i did . i swear .
<person> , well you ' re really gon na have some bad dreams if we find out you didn ' t .
what you ' re asking to do is sick .
you didn ' t have a problem when penetration was a sin , but when it ' s your wife , it ' s sick ? ! ? unbelievable . <continued_utterance> you knew the rules , <person> . i warned you . now , deacon , here , will remind you .
i ' m sorry ! it was an accident .
that was no accident !
we do not go into your courts .
people who don ' t go into our courts when they ' re told to sometimes go directly into our jail . <continued_utterance> look , i ' m genuinely sorry .
i swear to you that ' s all that happened . i haven ' t so much as set foot in your bedroom .
a lot that means .
for the inner satisfaction it will bring . saturday mornings , i ' d like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
i ' m as underprivileged as they are --

my chest is too small and my brain is too big .
oh , hi , <person> , yeah sure . <continued_utterance> . please darling , don ' t move . i ' ll be right back , okay ? i ' ll bring us back some champagne . <continued_utterance> you ' re a lifesaver , <person> . i thought i ' d never get away . <person> ' s waiting for me in the living room . <person> ' t she terrific ?

what brain ? <continued_utterance> what are you looking at ?
nothing .
you two wanta happy snap ?
no happy snaps .
<person> , <person> . i ' ve got plans .
what ? running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat .
what do you pay yourself ?
myself ?
they ' ve got snakes ?
i ' ve heard they ' ve got snakes that ' ll outrun a horse through the grass . they got a snake that bites you . you got eleven seconds to live . no thank you . i don ' t want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy . i ' d like to go to a place where . hold it !
speaking of people that are full of shit , funny you should mention those guys ! <continued_utterance> they put their records out through <person> , one of the biggest corporate machines on the planet . some revolutionaries , huh ?
come on , you ' re the one who ' s fooling yourself . why risk your life for your government when we can offer you a future that is truly free ? <person> is almost on top of him . <person> sights up and fires . the fire extinguisher explodes , blinding <person> . <person> makes a run for it . <continued_utterance> he blew the gate control . anders ! get the bastard !
i baby stepped . i owe it to you .
<person> , take a look around you . what does everything you see have in common ?

look at me -- well , not right at the moment -- but listen to me . you ' re with the wrong guy . i ' m the right guy . everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum ' cause i ' ve been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it ' s also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people . such is life . so dump that phony bastard and come to the open in my corner -- you can delay your romantic urges , which i know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess -- until the appropriate time . tell me you ' re not at least moderately attracted to me . <person> stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat , the leather straps , the bucket , the arrows -- for the moment he ' s forgotten how stupid he looks .
you have moments .
i ' m sorry . but , <person> , women are always discreetly late . it ' s expected of us .
<person> . and the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape .
a little respect would be nice , that ' s all .
<person> can ' t buy respect , ted . saying what you mean . meaning what you say . being an honorable person .
of course you did .

he finished it winter break . <continued_utterance> so . is he any good ?
no . not yet he isn ' t .
no i haven ' t .
so why are you doing it now ?
and ?
it ' s no arsonist ' s <person> , but i guess you know that . it ' s a young man ' s book . it got me remembering how it felt to be young .
so why did you leave ?
because it ' s a dying city . since the chinese take-over , who knows what can happen tomorrow ? in any case , this is my father , <person> : a royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations . said i ' d never amount to anything , but . i turned it into this he pushes through a door , into:
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters , <person> . i don ' t know about uranium , i don ' t know about <person> -- all i know is we did our job . it ' s over .
we neutralized anybody with a voice . <person> , <person> . <person> . anyone who was standing in the way of the land . is that it ?
how do you figure ?
according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls won ' t rest in peace .
no . he slept at <person> ' s . how about you ?
oak knoll . <continued_utterance> you ' re right , that ' s not who i am .
it has nothing to do with him .
well , what does it have to do with ?
no . he thinks i ' m with <person> and the girls . he won ' t go there .
he can ' t find you . as soon as we stop - before we stop - we ' ll jump off and i ' ll take you to a hotel in town .
yeah .
it ' s in here somewhere .
i don ' t know . he was always -- he always had to be better than you at everything . you know . like if you were all playing basketball or something , everybody ' s havin ' like a friendly game and he ' s like ready to kill somebody if his team didn ' t win . or like if you told like a joke or a story , he always had to tell a better one ? kinda gets annoying after a while . plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you . he was a prick . probably still a prick . fortunately for you though , your mom is like , the greatest . so you had some bad luck and you had some good luck . you mind if i ask you a personal question ?
i don ' t know .
i don ' t think so .
we are . we go to the police . we tell them the truth . now . before they find out . now . we save ourselves .

you ' ve never threatened me before . <continued_utterance> all right . i ' m not going to print anything until i have another source . but i promise you , i ' ll get one .
what do you mean by asking ?
come on , get on the board and let ' s see your approach .
the guy was history when he killed <person> . you knew that .
but then you knew what he was like all along . maybe his killing <person> was a thing you had counted on .
<person> , i guess , but - and heres the lesson part - they aint supposed to be so bad for you .
you aint gon na begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour , are you , sugar ? i mean , here you are crossin state lines with a a- number one certified murderer .

i tell you , i feel like a ghost .

yes , ma ' am , that ' s why i love it . and if you hit one good shot -- if that tuning fork rings in your loin -- you can ' t wait to get back . she cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night . it felt great and she knows it .

andlt ; andlt ; how am <number> you are as stupid as that one , but at least i can talk to you . andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; you ' ll be alright . he is from the f . b . i . he is here to help you . he wants to know what happened in the harbor . andgt ; andgt ;
actually , it was her husband ' s dog .
<person> , mr . <person> . you have a drug problem , all right ? on top of that , you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected . we pumped you with antibiotics so you ' ll be fine , but another day or two and you might have lost the foot . as for your spells . i ' m guessing they ' re a result of the anxiety you ' ve been experiencing lately .
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus , new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i don ' t know where you come from , ms . <person> , but where i come from , you don ' t go melting people ' s cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give ' em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -
i presume nothing , i am here to tell you that in time , the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet . perhaps even your children , senator .
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship .
<person> , why don ' t you get to the point where you get to the point .
you don ' t think there ' s some way you could work with me to try and resolve this , do you ?
how so ?
right . now it ' s used by somebody from the juarez cartel , one of his lieutenants . who knows ? every damn day there ' s birthday party . at first i thought they must have three hundred children , then i realized they ' re taunting us . three miles away and we can ' t touch them . ha , ha , ha .
who do we interface with on their side ?
<person> meant any harm . the boy was curious . i unloaded the gun -
it ' s not the gun . <person> ' t you understand . it ' s you . what you stand for . that is not for <person> . <person> looks at her thoughtfully . <continued_utterance> please , it has nothing to do with you personally .
fashionably five minutes late .
when you do this , i swear .
it ' s embarrassing . but you ' re all acting like you don ' t care ! well , i ' m not getting paid enough to just jerk around here . i don ' t know about you ?
i ' m not getting paid enough .
then i suppose it ' d be insurrection , and i suppose i ' d have to kill you . i suppose .

<person> , <person> . what should we do ?
i ' m not like <person> . <person> was crazy .
and you ; you ' ve got it all together .
<person> , raoul . i can give you stars , i know i can . just drop the safe on my head one more time .
i ' ve already dropped it on you twenty-three times .
then why am i going in ?
because you were chosen ? if the gods wanted you dead they would have killed you already .
<person> , this is going to take some time , and somebody ' s going to figure out soon enough we ' re not even supposed to be here . i ' m in serious violation of medical ethics .
we ' re being blamed for these deaths . scully , i want to know what this man died of . <person> ' t you ?
she could have hurt me if she wanted to .
you don ' t know that . if it ' s your belief that gives her form , then you ' ve got to shut her out . somehow you have to break the connection .
<person> , what happened to your hand ?
accident .
she would have just hung up on you again . the important thing is she knows <person> ' s fine .
you jerk ! you should ' ve said she was terrible , sick as hell ! practically on death ' s door ! what a jerk , what a pain in the ass you can be sometimes .
how did you survive ?
i used my body on the guards . it gave me control . i got to a gun and i took my chance . i ' ve never told anyone that . <continued_utterance> do you ever stop , <person> ? do you ever think about . another kind of life ?
precisely , mr . <person> . in a matter of minutes , the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor . and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
- instant melt-down .
but your clubs are your livelihood .
well the hood ain ' t too lively at the moment . <continued_utterance> whoever it is , tell ' em i ' m in houston on business .
that ' s not true , honey --
it is true ! he doesn ' t know anything about me . he still thinks i ' m like ten years old or something . as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything ' s fine . but it ' s not fine . nothing ' s fine .
oh , and why am i an asshole ?
multiple reasons .

<person> to me , fella .
they ' re not doing this , <person> . i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi . when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau . i felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . but it hasn ' t turned out that way . and now , if i were to be transferred to omaha , or <person> or some field office where i ' m sure i could rise , it just doesn ' t hold the interest for me it once did . not after what i ' ve seen and done .
you ' re . quitting ?
scully --
i ' ve got no allergy . something . this . <person> . i think . i think you should call an ambulance .

only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night , thelma ! who ' s gon na believe that ? ! we just don ' t live in that kind of world . <person> over !
about the consequences of the promises you made .
promises - i thought we had an understanding .
he will pretend to be . maybe at first he will be . but in the end , he will be glad .
and us ? what about us ?
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable .
what do you actually know with religion ?
<person> was telling me the dream house is finally finished .
<person> .
frightened ? you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe . i was petrified . then suddenly the wind changed , and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city , where i was instantly acclaimed oz , the first wizard de <person> !

maybe you ' re not aware of this , <person> , but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods , psycholingusitics , dna fingerprinting ; i don ' t have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers . <person> was killed right here .
go back to the m . e . , take a look inside <person> ' s exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there . trust me , there ain ' t chickens in the badlands . his mother ' s place is --

her dog , yes .
actually , it was her husband ' s dog .
are you sure i ' m not imposing ?
of course you are -- !
teething ?
does she drool ? does she cry all night long ? does she chew on her fists ? does she put everything into her mouth ?
she ' s sickly , no ?
if you or any of your friends harm her , as old as i am , i will kill you .
<person> , and who are you gon na take , your own palm ?
clever . i like the way you just spun that around on me . <person> <number> notices <person> talking to her friends .
and a car .
<person> , i ' m so proud of you .
but why ? you work right in the office -- nobody ' ll ever know .
i ' m surprised you ' d want help from anybody who fights for the pink team .
we ' re just trying to sneak a peak .
just stay off the property until i ' m off the phone .
finding food ? but i don ' t really know how to do this .
well , first of all , you can ' t do anything with a bull without the bull hook . <continued_utterance> it ' s the only way to train them . <person> .
any way we can do it better ?
sure . more money in intelligence on their side of the border . so we have a better idea who we ' re looking for . more dogs . more people . supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through . outside of martial law that ' s about the best you ' re gon na do . but , i should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . in the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we ' re pulling over the same number of cars . what does that tell you ?
me ? no . i ' m fine .
c ' mon , <person> ! <person> ' t you see who we ' ve got on board today ?
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it : those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids . your father arranged for your sister ' s abduction . he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program , so that she would survive . as a clone . he had different hopes for you . that you would uncover the truth about the project . that you would stop it . that you would fight the future .
why are you telling me this ?
about what ?
my cheekbones . what do you think of ' em ?
being negative ' s a lot more work than being positive .
like you ' d know .
why ?
forget why . do you want it or not ? <continued_utterance> well , go get it then .
no , damn it , it ' s wrong , they ' re <person> ' the law .
all right , <person> , your call . but give <person> the shotgun . they ' ll be <person> apt to get nervy if they see <person> on the street howitzer . <person> trades the shotgun for <person> ' s cane . <person> folds the shotgun under his cloak . they get set , waiting for <person> ' s cue . finally : <continued_utterance> well . come on , boys .
accident .
you got to be more careful . hands is important . let me show you something . when i was a kid , now i don ' t know if you can still see it , but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower .
you ' re a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
<person> thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me . <continued_utterance> you ' ve really got me confused , <person> . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew . and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i ' m not following your evolution .
go home !
you go home !
can ' t complain . got a house in <person> . <person> treating you good ? still seeing that sexy french gal ?
nah , she asked the wrong question .
is this your family ?
oh , sorry . this is my wife , er , <person> . my daughter <person> , and my son .
we got to get out of here . <person> says anything . this really scares <person> . <continued_utterance> we have to go back .
we ' re not going anywhere . not ' til we get what we came for .
why ?
she didn ' t have enough business .
well , we ' ll ask around . let you know if we hear of anything .
thanks . god , i hope they ' re not screwed up . i might have to bag the whole semester . <person> , sorry to bother you .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
nothing . it ' s just that <person> mentioned <person> has a thing for a guy named <person> , and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep . but obviously if that were you , you ' d know about it . must be a different <person> . <person> care now .
that ' s president <person> ' s nickname .
i don ' t know who the players are yet .
i don ' t know . <continued_utterance> i do know however , that you are very smitten with her .
it ' s not just me , is it ?
you know what i think you should do now . why don ' t you pull some files . some files that were completed , others that went unsold , and i ' ll have somebody run it down , talk to the customers and get some statements .
pulling files is another thing .
and that would ruin your reputation how ? <continued_utterance> what ' s that ?
i ' m reading all the novels on mr . <person> ' s best american authors list .
no one believes <person> or his books . he ' s a toiler . a crank .
and <person> ?
pride and prejudice .
she could be a real dog .
i don ' t know . why do you think ?
i ' m not sure yet , but i ' m starting to believe that everything happens for a reason . <person> , why did i eat the forbidden fruit ?
difference between you and me , old man , is i see the glass half full , you see it half empty .
<person> is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it ' s when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you ' re afraid of .
how do you -- the two of you -- get by ?
materially or spiritually ?
wan na fool around ?
yup .
who ?
<person> riordan ? my name ' s <person> .
yeah , but which are better : <number> - <number> pounds or <number> - <number> pounds ?
depends how much your baby weighs .
you think i don ' t know you held out on the d . a . ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? i can be on the phone to <person> in ten minutes .
the d . a . gave me immunity .
. <person> ' t get all .
. like it never even happened .
god . the law is some tricky shit , isn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> how do you know ' bout all this stuff anyway ?
besides , what do we say about the robbery ? no excuse for that . no such thing as justifiable robbery .
hey , sport . you winning ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> is everything going to be okay , <person> ?
not long at all , but i really like him . <person> , i know he ' s a little different , tucker , but that ' s what i like about him . he ' s a guy . a real guy . he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn ' t always politically correct and he probably farts , too . and that ' s okay with me .
that ' s what you ' ve been looking for -- a farter ?
<person> , you can ' t come in here .
i thought we might get some coffee . can i buy you -- ?
come back ?
never mind .
like i said , i hadn ' t really expected to use it . <person> , i ' m going through a drawer . i hear a car . i look out the window . i see <person> driving away . i leave my room , and there ' s <person> .
in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt .
i assumed we did . i mean , here . in the game . of course , we might not .
we ' d better check .
take it off . all of it . now ! you ' re a smart woman , for chrissakes -- don ' t you know the work of charlatans when you see it ?
no . i can always tell when someone is lying to himself , but i ' m quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me . that stuff cost me over <number> dollars --
how ? ?
use the philosopher ' s stone ! hur- ry ! invocation ! release them !
who are you ?
nobody . i ' m a nobody who arrested you , but your wife is a murderer .
like i said , these are fossils , and they weren ' t near the blast center , so they aren ' t going to tell you much .
may i ?
my new bike .
<person> funny .
i need to go out .
to see your father ?
well , i don ' t think . i don ' t particularly think anybody ' s life has any particular importance besides whatever -- you know -- whatever we arbitrarily give it . which is fine . i mean we might as well . i think i ' m as important as anybody else . <continued_utterance> i don ' t know : a lot of what you ' re saying has a real appeal to me , <person> . a lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids . but i don ' t want to believe something or not believe it because i might feel bad . i want to believe it because i think it ' s true or not . i ' d like to think that my life is important . or that it ' s connected to something important .
well , isn ' t there any way for you to believe that without calling it god , or religion , or whatever term it is you object to ?
did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?
yeah , i ' m doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i don ' t even know where to begin .
you live in the neighborhood ?
uh-huh . my nephew ' s going to be staying with us in a few months , so i stopped by .
uh , well , uh . he ' s the one can ' t see out of one eye .
<person> damn ! you actually gave little lord gayle a black eye ?
yes .
did you kill him ?
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with <person> ?
oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ?
i want my daddy ; i told you .
<person> , drag him in here . if you be nice , i will take you to disneyland . <person> , <person> and <person> put the suitcases down .
but when your sunflowers come up , i ' ll pay you for them .
i planted a row just for you and you don ' t owe me anything .
oh . thank you . she takes them .
why don ' t i put them in water ?
<person> wants to wrestle today .
you do ?
the theme of disease ? i ' m fucking reall infected ! is it going to crawl up my spine and rot my brain ?
all right , don ' t panic . i ' ve got something that will help you . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to seal up your bioport with this anti-viral resonator . <continued_utterance> it uses the umby pick-ups for power . should cleanse all your porting channels of infection in a few hours . it ' <number> give you a little skin buzz when it ' s done . of course , we can ' t play until then .
i didn ' t do anything . does it occur to you that maybe i was wronged ?
no !
<person> , i look at a hundred ideas a day . i choose one .
well , hope to hear from you , sir .
he ' s my friend . he ' s not a moron .
david <person> is a big sack of hot gas .
<person> ' t you think anyone ' s gon na notice that <person> ' s gone ?
they won ' t care . who ' s going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
drop out of the city council race or i send these pictures to the papers .
i ' ll fight you rotten-
do you think old peabody will sell ?
he ' ll sell .
too hot . <person> ' t do it . <person> ' t come in .

<person> .
the agents who have worked out here say its like going into nam . <person> terrain , foreign language , foreign customs . and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds . they hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here .

<person> and i . and she was there , <person> , she was . it scared <person> so bad she had to leave .

<person> to hear it .
he didn ' t suffer .
oh . well . i .
it ' s okay . . i ' m here when you want me .
he ' s dead .
oh , ted i ' m so sorry to hear that .
he served his time for what he did . another thing . if <person> went with him of her own volition - willingly , that is - there aint much can be done about it .
<person> talk down to me , <person> farragut . i know what volition means , and thats why i want <person> off the planet ! hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby . maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead . youd only be defendin yourself , and with his record , nobodyd fuss .
you bet .
did you study under <person> ?
not at present , sir . but i think the prudent answer is we don ' t know .
do we have any sort of intelligence from cia on what <person> is thinking ?
naturally . <continued_utterance> this guy ' s kinda dorky lookin ' .
<person> , the sniper . looks like a bookworm , but he had <number> confirmed kills in chechnya , they called him the `` finger of god '' . assassination and weapons .
is he gon na take the stand ?
no point . two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs . she flexes her arthritic wrists . <continued_utterance> you gon na eat before you leave ?
i can only hold him for twenty four hours , <person> . without staff corroboration .
i ' m not worried in the least , <person> . i ' m sure your entire staff will corroborate . with intensive treatment he should be out in about -- fifty years .

<person> would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn ' t have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
true true .

<person> .

yep .

that ' s because i don ' t have a doorbell .
oh . well , i . i just had to see you .
perhaps you failed to take into account my . hidden assets . <continued_utterance> the name ?
i can ' t tell you .
i doubt we ' ll have to go to trial .
. we told them we didn ' t want it to come out this way .
that ' s right , we didn ' t . i miss it sometimes . but , there are other things a <person> can do . <continued_utterance> the families . want your ticket . turn it in , we forget the whole thing . everybody goes home .
. absolutely not .
shut up and drink .
oh my goodness . do you see what i see ?
well , uh . i .
all right , i ' ll say it for you . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry . i got the note .
do you remember my first name , too ?
<person> . <person> <person> , right ?
my fight ' s not with you , holiday .
i beg to differ . we started a fight we never got to finish .
<person> , i clocked it : thirty-nine miles .
ah , you ' d bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging back yard . just shut your god- damn pie-hole .
you ' re going to let them get away with this . this shit ? on the word of one little white trash bitch .
you like seeing your name in the papers ? sandra glares at him . <continued_utterance> leave town , <person> . go to your place in st . barts . let things cool down . <continued_utterance> they ' ll try for twenty million . the cheaper the lawyer , the higher the demand .
<person> afternoon . may i help you ?
<person> , move !
who ?
remember that girl i told you about who got sick in st . <person> ? that ' s her ! the girl in the oxygen tent ! i told you about her ! the road company of `` student prince . `` the whole company went to church and prayed for her ! it was the most touching thing i ' ve ever seen in show business . <continued_utterance> i ' ll bring her over .
how long have you been doing this ?
' bout ten frames . <person> ' ll you see the pictures -- you look great .
bet you they ran outta shrimp .
yeah .
do it ?
you know . take the pictures ?
front .
am i in trouble ?
have you heard anything yet ? i mean , about the existenz test seminar and the shooting ?
oh , yes . it ' s come over all the media now . you ' ve never been more famous . your face is everywhere , which of course just . makes it worse . i .
you and <person> used to come out here together ?
<person> , sometimes . lots of the kids hang out here . you really think something bad happened to <person> ?
he ' s vulnerable . you ' re still a fresh face , boss . we ' ll use that to our advantage .
<person> , <person> ? hardly my political base .
<person> . it ' s <person> , isn ' t it ?
and you ' re <person> .
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for ?
he ' s only just dead . what was i supposed to do with him ? i can ' t take him away anywhere . and nobody wants to take him for me . do you ?
can somebody tell me ?
i ' m opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night . we ' ll see how she does with the crowd . she got any skills ?
<number> , <number> , <number> spring . <number> , <number> , <number> summer . <number> , <number> , <number> fall . time to go dad .
cut it out , <person> . <person> foot .
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ?
this is different .
that wasn ' t me . that was my game character . i wouldn ' t have done that . not here , anyway .
you ' re right . our characters are obviously supposed to jump on each other . probably to create emotional tension when danger happens . no use fighting it .
how does a man get to a place where he can say , ' throw those lives away , ' so easily ?
maybe it ' s harder for them to say it than they let on . at the very least , they believe it ' s in our best interest . and at the end of the day , they may end up being right .
before he can get there here comes this federal <person> , and <person> ' s indicted for jury tampering , they throw him in jail , he ' s gon na be disbarred , his life is over . <person> , gim me another drink . how are you ?
me , too .
yeah . i know he did .
why would he steal your cat , <person> ?
he sure walks like a girl .
and runs like one and talks like one and throws like one . probably takes a pee like one too -- just squats right down .
i have something to tell you . i didn ' t vote .
what ?
what ?
the west end . we buy it off the streets . i can stop , you know , and she can ' t . two people , really similar , we can talk about anything , but for me it ' s like a weekend thing , then i get my shit together , and for her it ' s different --
i ' m relaxed !
take a vacation .
that ' s it ! exactly ! you ' re reading my mind --
then maybe you can read mine . <continued_utterance> i thought i saw something in you , something good . but i was wrong .
yes .
<person> ?
if you want to know , i think your father is nervous about going on national television tomorrow . <person> himself would be anxious so let ' s be supportive , okay ?
he should go punch some pillows .
<person> .
yes .
<person> ! you wound me . i ' m fond of the guy , going way back to our days at university of houston , when we won all those titles together .
he says he carried you on his back .
it wouldn ' t be the greatest thing you could give him right now . we just split up .
<person> , i ' m sorry . who left who this time ?
<person> , if <person> were alive he ' d be a democrat -- and you know it .
<person> . but i do know one thing : you ' re exactly like him . my father was born wanting only one thing : to be president .
competence .
what ' s to tell ?
oh come on , <person> , he ' s a sweet guy . perfectly harmless .
you don ' t know that ! everything he ' s done violates the patient-doctor relationship . now he ' s in there with our son !
we let <person> finish this beating , we get his gratitude .
we gon na let rock-a-bye fight too-
maybe , later we could take a look .
sure , but let ' s finish up with this first .
if the dog hadn ' t stopped to pee , he ' d have caught the rabbit .
i think <person> was right about you i think you fight for the pink team .
<person> , i ' ll bet you would . you got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .
no , no , no . i love my husband .
nobody knows about your constant masturbation .
and nobody knows you ' re a virgin ! aw , who are we kidding .
do you always follow the rules ?
what is it with chicks always wanting guys to break the rules ? you-all have this bad boy complex -- -- she kisses him fiercely on the lips .
on to the next .
<person> ' t it a beautiful night ?
<person> ' t hurt me . <person> . please .
<person> up .
yes .
<person> for my parents , the tent , the band , the judge .
you won ' t get away with this !
good-day , <person> . i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .
no , you can ' t .
yes , i can .
but wait , you don ' t understand-
no <person> , you don ' t understand . i ' m through with lawing , i ' m through with the whole proposition . forever . i did my duty , now i ' d like to get on with my life . that is if you don ' t mind . <person> . good day now .
<person> , well , it ' s a nasty problem .
have another drink .
. i know .
and you missed this ? how are you going to miss something like this ?
where did you get this ?
off a high-powered paraski that was trying to kill me .
i ' ve got a plan how to get in there .
fine . he ' s got a plan
i didn ' t expect that to hurt . i expect the next part to hurt . <continued_utterance> yeah , that ' s what i expect will hurt .
i ' ve never crippled anyone yet .
i said maybe . i don ' t know . <person> , i ' m sorry about this afternoon . i really am . all right ? that was my boyfriend on the phone . he ' s coming over . so please leave . now .
i like you .
seventeen years of age , six-two , fluent in french , plays the piano , a champion swimmer , and writes <person> poetry . they stop at the gate to the saunders ' home .
i ' m not familiar with <person> poems .
we got over <number> legends in this tournament . <person> . <continued_utterance> call the police .
police ?
. so am i . whaddaya want , a beer ? hey <person> , bring another for the kid , he looks good , doesn ' t he ? <continued_utterance> . looks like you grown another inch . but you don ' t look so hot , getting bags under your eyes , starting to look old like me .
ah , i had a tough day . some jerk d . k ' d me and i got ta cover his loss .
<person> , darling !
yes , it ' s me , my dearest . i ' d embrace you but first i have to take care of some unfinished business .
<person> , your honor .
defense . ?
one thing i know : i can ' t goddamn wait till <person> gets back !
yeah , you can say that again !
nerves .
<person> . this is a team for the ages . kyle knocks on the door . <person> is with him .
let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable .
and if it doesn ' t ? by cooperating now we ' re but beggars to our demise ! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all .
<person> .
yeah .
you heard me : anybody or any thing .
it ' s got no bullets , for <person> ' s sake .
<person> ' t call me a <person> . my name is <person> .
<person> , <person> . i ' m madmartigan . <continued_utterance> you a woodcutter ?
me and my friends sneak in on the weekends . we hang around , pick up on the babes , drink some wine , get wasted on killer hash --
you shouldn ' t be smoking either .
would you like some iced tea ?
very much .
why won ' t you let me contact <person> ? they ' ve got to be going crazy , wondering what ' s happened to you . i mean , it ' s not like we ' ve done something wrong . we just ran because we didn ' t know how many of them there were , right ? i think we owe it to <person> to let them know you ' re all right , to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he ' s doing . and besides , i can ' t . i can ' t just keep doing this , whatever it is , you know , forever , not having any idea when it ' s going to be . <continued_utterance> hey , what are you doing ?
where ' s your bioport ? <person> ' t tell me you were never fitted . i can ' t believe it .
why ?
well . her store was very close to our store , and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost --
it doesn ' t mean anything .
why would they do all that if we weren ' t ?
you think i can ' t add ?
' dayo ! . da , da , da , da , day . daylight come and he wan na go home . '
do we really need another `` recipe ? ''
i want to make sure our guests are surprised .
all my things have me in them . i don ' t want you to be like me .
but i love you , <person> .
usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself , probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of grass and hay .
what does it mean for us ?
yeah , then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day .
have you done your homework , honey ?
northeast sir !
unfurl the squares !
<person> . i ' ll be back .
<person> steps , he ' ll be back . <person> steps , he ' ll be back .
a jockey ? you mean , like --
horses , right . <person> something . <person> stops on his pad , looks up .
wait a minute . just listen to me .
. and he thought he ' d clock old <person> mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper . and then maybe borrow $ <number> or $ <number> , <number> , or $ <number> , <number> . <person> ' s not the reason i ' m here , <person> . <continued_utterance> there ' s another reason ? it better be good .
no . <person> .
what ' s worse than being interrupted ?
<person> good . it ' s sixth century b . c . do you like the period ?
i adore it .
. i just , you know , after all that religious conversation , i just realized it ' s probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesn ' t believe his life is important in the scheme of things --
would you please .
maybe .
i got ta run . have a good one .
last week . a small event , of course .
when i last heard she was governess to his children .
but i ' d face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains . <person> - - i won ' t be any trouble , because i don ' t eat a thing -- and i won ' t try to manage things , because i can ' t think . <person> ' t you take me with you ?
why , of course i will !
yes .
but you can ' t tell us what she wanted to talk about .
restin in our room . she aint been feelin well .
<person> to hear it .
so what are you going to do ?

you haven ' t seen <person> around , have you ? i ' m looking for her .
no . but if i do , i ' ll tell her you ' re looking for her , jake . jake whatcha got there , some trash ? <continued_utterance> <person> , how things happen . a man ' s car breaks down . there ' s a hold up . people die and all that money -- and now old jake out looking for his young wife . and then you show up . <continued_utterance> time ' s running out , son . i ' ll be seeing you in the morning .
what was that all about ?
you know how that <person> is . thinks every man he sees is after his <person> .
it doesn ' t matter where i go or what i do . <person> or later somebody ' s calling me ' outlaw . '
are you refusing to serve your king ?
it ' s just -- the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall . so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down .
why don ' t i just call the plumber ?
get out of town , <person> , as quick as you can .
<person> , i ' ve been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you ' re becoming the queen of hot and cold .
`course he ' s watching .
well , you ' ve raised him up a true <person> , ted , picture of his father , he is : not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that ' ll lead him to insist on the impossible . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t a farmer in devon didn ' t admire you , myself among `em , leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground . you ' ve fettle enough for twenty men , but with a gimpy leg and the drinking - for the pain , isn ' t it , that you drink ?
she had nothing to do with the tower jump . she ' s nobody . i just met her last night . tell them . i hardly know you .
keep the ring . it looks better on you anyways .
only the best for my mother .

yeah me . king ! but she betrayed me . she robbed me of my dream . <continued_utterance> i ' ll never fall in love again .
did you tell her about us , <person> ?
there is no us , you psychotic bitch .
how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .

well you got trouble and it starts with you .
i ' m not gon na fight you , there ' s no money in it . sober up . come on , boys .
i know . i ' m just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution .
well it feels like it . i ' m leaving her another message .
i need an extension for my case .
you should have taken their offer . especially if you were unprepared .
<person> and <person> declined . guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog .
<person> . he ' s out .
there ' s no one here .
norma , are you alright ?
<person> !
no cabs !
well , now , maybe you won ' t have to .

<person> move you put on that sucker , now let ' s get up there , take the drop , and make our par , tie <person> .
sort of a day office . come on -
i ' m not going in there .
i don ' t know . could be . one thing ' s certain . the key is spontoneity . be unpredictable . they can ' t stand that . that ' s why we ' ve got to get outta here . can you come with me ?
where ' re we going ?
i want to believe you . i really do .
you will believe me , because it ' s true .
<person> nonsense . this won ' t prove a damn thing .

thank you .
is this your family ?
<person> . not a very well-drawn character . and his dialogue was just so-so .
<person> . <continued_utterance> do we blame ourselves for that ? the bad dialogue ? or would it be bad no matter who was ported in ?
if you try to run , i ' ll hunt you down and kill you myself .
yes or no , mr . <person> ?
i just haven ' t seen you like this in a while . i ' m used to seeing you more sedate .

they were all gon na jump me back there . what ever happened to one against one ?
ain ' t our way . we go all on one , one on all . fight one of us , you fight us all . that ' s the cowboy way .
i made it a contest . the one who does best gets his cereal back first . children like to help . they only need to be kept after a little bit . <person> means no harm by this , but <person> ' s eyes begin to storm .
oh , is that so ? no offense , lady , but i ' m not so sure i like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down !
just like <person> . i oughta just bash your head in --
hey ! you didn ' t let me finish . as soon as i get in there i ' m going to talk to somebody and get you invited , okay ?

no and i don ' t plan on sticking around either .
<person> : the entertainment division is releasing three new animated children ' s movies this year . by the time we ' re finished promoting them on our tv , radio , cable , newspaper , and magazine outlets - there won ' t be a parent in the universe who won ' t feel guilty if they don ' t take their children to our stores and theme parks to buy the toys , books , video- games and clothing featuring our ' lovable little creatures .

okay , you win . now try to get some sleep , huh .
last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot . know what happened : he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung .
maybe you ought to read him pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .
what in blazes ? .
the interview you gave was syndicated in sunday papers all over the country . <continued_utterance> they ' re here to see you .
the experiment was a failure . kelly didnandiacute ; t make it . yes , you were successful in activating his mutator gene , but you failed to take into account the rest of his body -- it wasnandiacute ; t ready for the strain . kelly was dead within hours . your machine kills .
<person> .
you are relentless .
i wouldn ' t be a proper girlfriend if i didn ' t nag every now and then .
a
yeah . <continued_utterance> <person> ! what the hell is it ? ! where are you ?
<person> .
and to what do i owe this pleasure , the pleasure of --
what . ?
<person> ' t you remember ? you brought action against him for stealing your psychoanalysis notes and they booted him . the only place that would take him after that was university of guadalajara .
what will this cost ?
a percentage of your <person> stake in perpetuity . you buy my silence for a fourth of <person> .
<person> ? !
they get too excited .
<person> luck next time .
so is my friend . is <person> still here ?

<person> .
<person> , thanks a lot , <person> -- believe them instead of me .
you could help me try and figure it out ! i got ta figure out what to do , and you could try and help me .
i suggested we go to the police , but you didn ' t like that ; so , frankly , <person> , i ' m all out of ideas .
<person> .
go ask if you can put your tongue in his mouth . i hear it works every time .
<person> , mrs . <person> .
for instance , if a child is having trouble getting to sleep , what would you do ?
hi .
who ' s been working with you ?
you think ? they ' re playing the <person> . i don ' t do that one so well .
are you kidding ? go ! <person> !
<person> ' s bioport .
really ? that ' s what did all the damage ?
<person> sends his regrets but he had to take a trip .
what kind of trip ? i thought you were working with him .
you don ' t know anything . borrowed your car . <person> ' t say why . and you never heard of that woman and her boy .
<person> , why ? .
consider it done .
and doing so , shall earn you the gratitude of . a king .
you may have to . i don ' t . filby all right . take a journey on your contraption . what would you become ? . a greek ? a roman ? one of the pharaohs ? <continued_utterance> i prefer the future .
you ' re not seriously saying you can do it ?
they ' re on me . they ' re smoking me out !
<person> ' s smoking anybody out .
yeah , why ?
when the hell did this package arrive ?
we might be able to work it .
that would be wonderful .
damn it , jake . there is a guy coming to kill me , and if it comes down to me or <person> , then i pick <person> . you were going to give me thirteen-thousand . give me two-hundred . i ' ll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it . she showed me the perfect place . there won ' t be enough left for an autopsy . but i need the the money . i ' ve got to have the money .
she ' s in the bedroom .
it ' s not a backpack , it ' s a knapsack .
<person> ' t forget your knapsack . <continued_utterance> give me a kiss .
i ' m fine . it ' s your dad i ' m worried about . how is he ?
upstairs . resting . i can ' t understand why he ' d attack you like that .
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them .
then why don ' t you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while ?
letting a lunatic like parker <person> loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .
not if you ' re with him every step of the way .
<person> .
<person> stultorum magister .
you were never that innocent sugarpie .
. how do you know ? you wish .

<person> kid , i ' m speaking of . your biological parents .
so i hear .
no offense , <person> , but you look sorta crappy .
but he ' s decided to go to <person> too .
to cover you or the war ?
or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants .
i have to go now .
i was down in <person> .
<person> ?
that ' s a terrible thing to say . it ' s not possible .
have you asked him if he ' s married ? have you said , `` are you married ? ''

i swear .
<person> ? as in `` the donner party ? ''
i ' m not sure of the name ' s origin . they ' re the two paths we regularly patrol . something happens and you ' re on one of the other trails , it might be awhile before we find you .
i ' ll bet he ' s got an opinion on the stock market too . this apartment is already ahead of its time . i call it the `` demolished '' look . they ' ve already heard about it at house and <person> and they ' re coming next week to photograph it before it gets . lived in . is that alright ? i ' d love to have it in my portfolio .
sure . but your fee . considering you ' re way over budget , should be negotiable .
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle . he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble . his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing . and he couldn ' t swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn ' t get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver . i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . <person> ! it just stuck up there and spread out . it was about the size of a half dollar . and that ' s why i don ' t ever eat fish eyes . he plays the guitar for <person> . then stops . truman i ' m not saying it ' s right or wrong , it ' s just the way i feel . it ' s the custom thing i was thinking of . in america we don ' t use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides . we throw away the tail , the rest of the insides and the head .
i understand .
if we were a team , we could do anything . i mean , anything .
<person> to the chase , <person> . your audience is way ahead of you .
that was fun today . you ' re good . i ' m glad you started wrestling again .
yeah . me too .

did she hear me say scotch straight up ?
my sources tell me this home improvement commission is for real . it ' s no jackpot . these guys are going to be a real pain in the ass , so any of the scams that you guys are pulling , they get wind of it , they take your license and it ' s goodbye to this business .

the thing about fishing <person> , is you need to let ' em run some . <person> ' em just enough slack so they don ' t break the line . but at the same time you ' ve got ta keep enough tension to wear ' em down , bring ' em in slowly so they don ' t really know they ' re hooked .

he ' s a friend . he ' s also like the only one who was dealing with the situation . he ' d definitely had a few beers , but it ' s not like he wanted to drive . we didn ' t know what else to do . it wasn ' t my pot .
we ' ll pray that he doesn ' t die ! but if he does , then we ' ll find a way so no one knows !

we ' ll eat dinner .
<person> , eat all you think of is your stomach ! <continued_utterance> it ' s a kind of new dance number .
that is for interrupting . and that is for being wrong . we do not tolerate mistakes .

this is the feur thing ?
yes . and he ' s going to get away with it . <person> ' s momentarily speechless .
that ' s more like it . where are you at , anyway ?
where i ' m at is maybe <number> .
i said poker ' s an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .
depends how you look at it . i mean it ' s not like anybody ' s holding a gun to their heads .
who told you to look at <person> ' s files ?
i took the initiative .
he used to come around here . he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades . <continued_utterance> got sort of hung up on her , from what hear .
she still work there ?
faulty wiring .
esthetics are subjective , aren ' t they , <person> ? i ' m <person> <person> . if you ever need me .
we must be in the florida keys . . . the overseas highway connects the islands to the mainland .
so there ' s no border , no customs . they can just drive anywhere they want . . . there ' s nothing to stop them . . .
well . look .
so it ' s the rockettes , so what ?
i . i just . i just don ' t think it ' s the place i wan na get caught for doin ' something like . if you blow a guy ' s head off with his pants down , believe me , texas is the last place you wan na get caught ! trust me ! now , i said , i don ' t wan na talk about it ! !
okay . we ' ll go around texas to get to mexico . this is crazy .
i felt you . looking through me .
we walked all night .
when nobody ' s looking . <continued_utterance> you just worry about yourself , <person> . <person> ?
<person> .
accidental ?
agent desmond , would you hold the finger for me . there ' s something up there .
we had a lot of arguments .
there ' s a responsibility that you ' ve got to have . it ' s a long way from high school , <person> .
thirty five a month with locker . we ' re open at <number> , lights out at <number> .
sure .
oh , i am surprised , you seem like a very religious person .
you ' re kidding , right ?
the bastille ! i ' m in the bastille !
well , you ' re the first person who was ever happy to be here . unfortunately , your visit will be a short one .
how long were you with the dog ? alone , i mean ?
ah . he was hurt bad . <person> nicked an artery . i don ' t know . an hour . hour and a half . <continued_utterance> what the hell you looking at me like that for ?
<person> , stop and think . <person> around you . we are outnumbered .

you called <number> . except the call was intercepted .
they took her --
oh no . no way . i ' ve had all the bad news i can take for one day .
it ' s about your parents .
<person> , help me . <person> ' t anyone owe us money ?
yes , i told you before , there are people who owe you money but they ' re not paying . there ' s too much heat on <person> .
security is everything these days . it ' s the only one and its stuck inside and it ' s your fault . <continued_utterance> i ' ve devoted my five most passionate years to this strange little creature . and i ' ve never regretted it , <person> , because i knew that it was the only thing that could give my life any meaning .
but why is it my fault ? i ' m telling you , i didn ' t , i did not neural-surge . i didn ' t . i didn ' t feel any surging .
you ' re sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman ' s body in the morgue ?
the bone was porous , as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it .
i ' d just like to talk , ask a few questions .
i ' ve got nothing to say about anything or anybody .
i ' m sick .
then i ' ll take you home . you ' ll feel better tomorrow .
there , there , lie quiet now . you just had a bad dream .
no --
yes .
i know if he could have it back somehow , he wouldn ' t do it differently or have it any other way . he wouldn ' t . he loved his job .
<person> ' t you wan na tell me you love me ?
i love you .
do you know he won ' t expel him ?
no . but i don ' t think that matters .
yes , sir .
and i will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the president . <person> . you don ' t understand a thing , do you , admiral ? <continued_utterance> this isn ' t a blockade . <continued_utterance> this , all this , is language , a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen . this is president <person> communicating with secretary <person> . mcnamara jabs his finger out at the plot , and --
<person> ' t do that ! i ' m innocent i tell ya . the police ' ll just dip me . they were waitin ' for me when i got home last night . i ran .
if you ' re so innocent , why ' d you run ?
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .
and no one will know the truth .
i asked two of my friends to act as seconds , but they are not as punctual .
but you ' re wounded .
not really . yes , the fisher wedding chairs .
<person> . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
they - that ' s bullshit . they don ' t operate anymore .
mcmanus has a friend in the fourteenth precinct . they ' re coming out for one job - thursday . they ' re picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of south america . <person> and mcmanus have a fence set to take the stuff .
damn it . have her fax some photos up here . <person> patrol .
been a while since we had a couple go missing . twelve months ago the last ?
what are you doing in new york . ?
come on , we ' ll get a cup of coffee .
my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?
that ' s not the game .
meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger .
how `` big '' are we talking about ?
<person> , i wonder why ?
who was she ?
you ' re saying that <person> was raped by <person> .
that ' s right .
x marks the spot .
something like that .
because he thinks she ' s seeing another man ?
. and he assigned me to find out who the man is . <continued_utterance> we all know the revolutionaries are going to win , don ' t we ?
i ' ll do some this afternoon .
no , i need to take them with me .
yeah . he was lookin for you .
you talk to im some ? .
reckon the heads cracked , like i thought .
<person> , thats what i was afraid of .
kill it ! shoot the damn thing -
here . you shoot . i ' ll drive .
then give that five grand back .
<person> stole it .
and what is a `` <person> '' and why he is on my train ?
just looking for work , sir .
-- well , maybe two-seventeen .
you ' re trying to tell me you can read all that from a track ?
i did not --
i thought all that <person> stuff was so charming . f-o-x .
weird . got some kind of snowball effect goin ' here or somethin ' .
you ' re still with us though . you ' re somewhere on the face of the earth ?
oh - look out .
you know something ? mcu -- lion and <person> -- <continued_utterance> i believe they ' re spooks around here . mcu -- <person> and <person> --
that ' s exactly why we need them .
get these `` scum '' , mr . gibbons , bring them in . test them . train them . find your man .
how do we find the guerillas ?
va alli , dos o tres cuartos , doble la esquina al francotirador .
<person> interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts , <person> . you tell me <person> , who could come up with shit like were seein these days ?
you got me , peanut .
why ? . hes right in the groove .
hes so ugly . guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type .
to watch the sacrifice . the king demands it .
is that compulsory ? because i saw one when i first got here and it made me a little sick --
<person> , i was thinking we ought to -
at ease !
' cause <person> used to own it .
but he ' s dead .
what if he didn ' t ?
i don ' t know how i can bail now , he ' s going to be here any minute .
shit .
' fuck . ' ' shit . ' these are highly technical golf terms and you ' re using them on your first lesson -- this is promising .
because he was talking to me . <continued_utterance> does he know something ?
the old man saw an owl . over there in the dry wash . last week .
may i advise you ? <continued_utterance> <person> was only nine years old when his father was assassinated . he lost his childhood forever that day . i have watched him grow toward manhood , seen the toll his life demands . a boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man . he is shy , yet boastful . giving , yet stubborn . but most of all , he is not yet sure exactly who he is . the boy who lost his father . or the king of france .
but how can i . ?
yeah .
this kid is good . so just . you know . be ready out there .
i have a terrible urge to port into it . what about you ?
oh , sure . yes . desperate to port into it .
<person> , kids now are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age . you probably think she ' s still a virgin --
<person> ' t be ridiculous . she ' s only -- how old is she ?
you ' re in kinship ?
yes . but that ' s not why i called .
well , this is it . we get the car , find some americans . we find americans we ' ll be all right .
we ' ll make up some kind of lie . they won ' t find the gold .
we might want to perform a spectral analysis .
`` we ? ''
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half <person> . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
about an hour and a half , because that ' s all the longer i ' ve been gone .
a transportation system . transgenic crops . the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus .
that would be my guess .
<person> . <person> everybody .
this narrow defeat was probably due in large part to the surprising last- minute reversal by senator scott andigrave ; frankandicirc ; <person> , who until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for mutant registration . earlier today , <person> had this to say:
sheandiacute ; s a mutant .
<person> , well , nobodyandiacute ; s perfect . <continued_utterance> listen -- i donandiacute ; t want any trouble .
where i ' m at is maybe <number> .
<person> again ?
<person> . here we go again .
<person> ' t you see her this morning ?
start of what ?
i don ' t know , yet . what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale , not decreasing . whatever it is , he isn ' t finished .
but at the very least . it does suggest he ' s been co-opted by hard line elements .
<person> at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup . a puppet <person> , and a hard-line soviet government pulling the strings . no deal . and the missiles are almost operational .
<person> , we all set ?
yup .
i know , but have you seen the machines ?
no , only heard of them .
pentagon , nothing . he owns a little hotel in a winter resort in vermont .
our old man ?
what ' s that ?
i work with retards .
sort of shorthand .
shorthand . really ?
were you in nam ?
airborne . that ' s where they used to get us agents from . now we get ' em from carnegie-melon , ivy league . accountants and computer whiz-kids . yuppies with guns . that ' s scary shit .
i did , honey , but that was last night . lets just find those two kids before its too late .
<person> , i have to ask you this .
your father ?
all his years at sea , he never stopped talking about these islands .
<person> . <person> steps . <person> steps . <continued_utterance> you flying or driving ?
<person> . i ' ll be back .
<person> , well , you fixed that . what the hell happened , anyway ?
the bitch shot me , is what happened . <continued_utterance> hey , what did you want me to do , die ?
you ' re moving away because it ' s going to blow up , isn ' t it ! ? it ' s going to blow up !
i said be cool , all right ? now be cool !
<person> , silent , fuming , sitting at the table .
her entire testimony must be stricken from the record . you shouldn ' t have heard it , but you did . now , that was my mistake . and you must strike it from your minds , give it no weight .
<person> , my chest hurts . i always taught you , bb , never walk out of a place without a signed contract . somebody ' s word ain ' t spit .
they ' ll sign , <person> . <person> ' t worry , they ' ll sign .
exactly . if they ' re sane and human like we are , then maybe we just refuse , and they ' ll let it slide , like we ' ve been letting things slide .
so we reject the second letter .
this just came for you , <person> . whatever it is i ' m going to have to include in the bank ' s report of assets . <person> . you ok ? <continued_utterance> i also have documents to sign .
i didn ' t believe the lawyer or the bank . my mother worked . they had savings . we were never broke . so why would they need a mortgage ? and then it hit me .
what ? ! ? but , sheeni . i just don ' t get it . i ' m here . <person> ' s here too .
i know , <person> , and i ' ve been longing for you so . but we ' ll just have to find another way . the car is already packed . <continued_utterance> <person> twisp , i will not allow you to accept defeat so easily !
well , you are his grandfather . he is supposed to spend some time with you . you ' re supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that .
junior spends time with his child .
what ?
i wan na play a song on the juke . you got a quarter ? <continued_utterance> what happened to your hand ?
yeah .
where ' d you go to school ?
i wan na get a job . i wan na work at club med .
yes ! yes ! now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that ?
i just can ' t believe it .
this is your moment , don ' t you see ? the instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again . when you stand up and are counted .
well , no , it isn ' t . but never mind . the waitress brings them two boilermakers . sammy and brian thanks . <continued_utterance> well , here ' s to improved employee- management relations .
amen . <continued_utterance> you can ' t judge all of scottsville by the people in that bank , believe me .
hold on a second .
i ' m going to have you disbarred . i ' m going to have your ticket . you know what you did ? do you know what you did ?
no . not yet . oh and he was smoking too . he ' s sixteen !
he ' s probably on drugs .
<person> ?
i saw a movie once . part of it took place in heaven . everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses . like that . at least that ' s the way i remember it . abruptly , <person> glances at his watch . <continued_utterance> i should be going .
sodium amytal , maybe some other truth agent .
it makes you tell the truth ?
. i was a friend of your fa .
you never knew my father . you get out of here , who the hell do you think you are .
come on , get on the board and let ' s see your approach .
my approach is to be suave and debonair and sophisticated .
i ' m not familiar with <person> poems .
i could recite one of trent ' s if you ' d like .
are you being serious ?
yeah . here , i ' ll give you an example . <continued_utterance> <person> never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it . and with <person> , as i said , the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety . when he was really flipping out , in other words .
i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up .
<person> , well , like my <person> used to say . you can ' t change your christmas past , but you sure can exchange your christmas presents .
you ' re talking about a very expensive risk here .
he ' s gotten closer in <number> hours than all of the other operatives combined . he got us an account number to boot . now even if he ' s just dumb and lucky , i say we back his play . i put him out there , <person> . if he doesn ' t come up with the money , they ' ll kill him . i can ' t let that happen .
the men of the city are weak and soft , fat with rich food , intoxicated by strong drink .
really . tell me more .
the grass to the left is taller than we are - it ' s perfect cover .
excellent work , sergeant major . <person> spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted .
<person> , fell down and hit a rock . not as bad as it looks .
there was a young fellow over at jamilla ' s today when it got hit . way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .
<person> ? please excuse me , ladies . i ' ll be right back . <continued_utterance> what is it , <person> ? <person> , where are you ?
<person> ! hey , <person> ! are you okay ?
dr . <person> is quite skilled .
i hear <person> is great this time of year .
i paid you all your money !
not the extra charges .
i think we both know who did . what ' s so urgent ?
i need your help --
what ?
on the <number> th , right ? how old ?
then get <person> on the horn , so you can relay that order . i ' m here on his word . now , what happened ?
guard dogs are dead . <person> ' s missing .
<person> , two l ' s .
four dollars and seventy nine cents . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
hit it . <person> . while it isn ' t looking .
my mind says `` yes yes '' but my body says `` no no '' . it ' s hopeless .
no .
what ' s wrong ? is it me ?
did your mom just crank call you ?
no .
tell diamond joe the animals need more water when the humidity ' s this bad if i don ' t see him before i go .
you ' re not going anywhere . you belong here . these animals . they ' ve been waiting for you . <continued_utterance> but don ' t ever disobey me like that again . i ' ll give you this one . i ' ll call it `` respect '' . next one i call `` betrayal '' . <person> ? <continued_utterance> i do thank you though . you and <person> solved a much bigger problem for me .
i ' ll be evacuated with the president .
<person> . so while you ' re under a rock somewhere with the president , what am i supposed to do with your five children ?
it really will do that , yes . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t hurt me , <person> . <person> ' t make me go back in alone . play with me .
<person> , i ' m worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth . i ' m thinking i was right never to have a bioport installed .
baggage stock horses . they pack ' em in <number> a car .
how do you stand the smell ?
if you think you don ' t owe them anything , you ' re not obliged to go .
they haven ' t done much for you . hardly anything . you do what you think is right !
why did i what ?
come after me . time traveller i did it to save your life , young lady , which i ' m afraid doesn ' t hold much meaning for you or anyone else . the girl it doesn ' t .
you told the guard ?
i saved our lives ! and <person> ' s . i had no idea <person> would banish him for what he did .
it ' s a goddman trial balloon . trial is the operative word , here .
then somebody ' d better deny it publicly .
i know . i know . change in the lineup . <person> , maybe it ' ll help . maybe it ' ll help . you got any ideas for a new partner ?
well , i had a conversation with <person> , so . maybe i ' ll go with him . <person> is gon na need a new partner because <person> is going into used cars .
yes sir . well , so we figured as long as we had the opportunity we ' d do a little rehearsing . <person> here .
why here ? <person> looks to <person> for help as they move toward the lobby .
-because your a thug with a law degree . because i thought by now you ' d be so indebted to this department for not indicting and/or imprisoning you , that diligent , honest discharge of duty would be assured . and i made a horrible misjudgment .
<person> and <person> don ' t think so .
<person> ?
oklahoma , thelma . we ' re crossing into new mexico .
you ' re lucky somebody got to you first , madmartigan ! i ' d ' ve killed you myself after that stunt at land ' s end !
<person> ! come on , <person> . lem me outa here .
<person> ? with this pad , the killer wheels ?
what can i tell you ? it ' s a healthier lifestyle down here , and it ' s easier to succeed when your head ' s clear . those guys i worked with back in boston , they were a bad influence .
i didn ' t mean it that way .
you know you don ' t have to sneak . you could stay with me . i know things , <person> . sweet things . i could make you so happy .
sixteen .
<person> ! sixteen years ? what do you think ? is it worth it ?
i don ' t like it here . i don ' t know what ' s going on . we ' re blundering around together in this unformed world , whose rules and objectives are largely unknown , seemingly indecipherable , or even possibly non-existent , always on the verge of being killed by forces we don ' t understand .
that sounds like my game , all right .
no .
will they ?
i don ' t know . they don ' t cover this in philosophy <number> .
what about that book , in the back ?
i ' ll wait out here .
give me your wrist .
i can ' t remember the last time i told <person> that i loved her .
well , honey , go in and tell her now .
<person> ?
wife and daughter are here .
yes , we do , <person> ! we do . it makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation . he ' s just a kid .
i know . i know . you ' re right .
you should feel good about this .
i feel like a traitor .
hey , look at him , <person> . he ' s playing `` grandma ' s <person> . ``
right , come on , <person> . back you go .
a little fucking thin ? ! i still got the shanks ! everybody ' s watching ! <person> , <person> is here .
maybe we should work on putting . ya can ' t shank a putt .
<person> , tell you what : i ' ll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan .
japan ? what ' s she doing in japan ?
no . but once i heard .
what ?
<person> ' s got tits that big , too .
<person> , but he was with <person> at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with <person> and then with <person> . and since i stole <person> away from him . are you following this ?
you disappoint me , <person> .
<person> sir . <person> -
well she ' s out of her mind .
she is not .
my name is mister <person> . - <person> ' t you hear the air raid siren ?
you mean that horrible screeching ?
that ' s the face of my kaiser and he does not look pleased with me . the horse is yours .
<person> quiet , hasn ' t it ?
well , i think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his lincoln . he ' s giving my mom a joyride in it now . but he ' ll be back this afternoon , so i would come back then . he ' s pretty stubborn . you might have to beat it out of him .
that can be arranged . in the meantime we ' re leaving the piece of shit in the driveway . with a note .
i want to be here . with you . what do you want .
i want this war to end . i ' m not going to tell the world that <person> is dead .
<person> ' t send it .
too late . i hate her .
umm , yes . she was driving .
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city . he also says that at that time he met a man . he identified you through a series of mug shots . he also told us that you and mrs . <person> seemed `` close . `` is that true ?
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock .
i always had chickens , ducks and whatnots .
helen , there ' s a double agent in my outfit . i don ' t know who . there ' s no one i can trust . except you . can you get away ?
i don ' t know . i have to think .
oh , no -- please . i have to rest for just a minute . <person> !
oh , you can ' t rest now -- we ' re nearly there ! mcu - lion yawns and speaks -
i ' ve watched some ski shows .
<person> , right .
i know , <person> , i appointed him .
<person> , well that hardly qualifies him to be <person> ' s guardian . what ' s the motivation here ?
i did kill us . she thinks we ' re dead .
what the hell are you talking about ?
the old man saw an owl . over there in the dry wash . last week .
and .
can i come ?
why would you want to go to school if you didn ' t have to ?
i don ' t need one . i don ' t expect to win .
how so ?
you know what happened .
nothing happened .
there is no catch . i put together a tournament with an elite field and a half-million dollar purse , and i ' m tired of seeing all the money head out of town .
then make more birdies .
you mean the idiot who ruined our operation ?
have you got him ?
you two have , of course , just served me up your balls -- if that ' s what they ' re called -- on a platter . i can bury you both . you ' re handing me your careers . <continued_utterance> well , <person> . this is a motherfucking story , russell . what am i supposed to do with it ?
anything you want .

my bodyguard . he follows me everywhere . he ' s decisive , vigilant . and he makes an excellent omelette .
<person> good for you . i bet it works out for you .
we ' ll see . if it doesn ' t , what the hell , at least i gave it a shot .
<person> , big favor .
you didn ' t have to come with me , you know . i didn ' t ask you to come .
i mean . i just think . i don ' t know : we had a great little fling . you know ? let ' s not push it . i mean , is that ok ? i just --
<person> . sure . ok . you ' re right .
and his humility ? <continued_utterance> <person> won ' t be alone . <person> will be at his side to give him counsel .
yes , but <person> ' s still a boy . he could be a great king . <continued_utterance> . if we only had more time .
what ?
where did you get this ?
cameriere ! no caffe for signor !
with milk !
<person> . what if they ' re not saudi . <continued_utterance> if it ' s a checkpoint , it could be iraqi . <person> considers this .
we ' ve got no cboice . <person> way , we ' ve got no choice .
about yourself ?
about anything .
i made macaroni .
i got ta go out . about a replacement . . mower blade .
i love living here . and i refuse to clean up !
no problem .

you ' re referring to my managerial salary ?
<person> ? for what ?

i asked you to marry me . i ' m ready for marriage . that ' s responsibility . that ' s growth .
incinerate it . like the others .
this man ' s family will want to see the body laid to rest .

<person> ' t flatter yourself . i ' m fine . <person> - sofia is great , but by no means one-of -- a-kind . she was a proximity infatuation . <continued_utterance> and don ' t use that , it ' s mine .
where ' d you get the camera ?
interpreted by another guy like my father .
your father doesn ' t like me .
heh-heh .
are you peeking ?
it ' s simple . bad things happen sometimes . it wasn ' t <person> or <person> . it was all of us . everyone in this room . because we all knew the risks . you sent us . you paid our tuition , you allowed us to go . so to invent a reason for why this happened , to pin it on one person , well that won ' t change anything . it ' ll just make our experience meaningless . <continued_utterance> if you want to judge this man , judge him by his crew . judge him by alice and <person> . <person> and <person> and <person> . in one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us . this may sound crazy but the <person> wasn ' t just a ship , or even a school . it was something that we made , that ' s inside us . that ' s who <person> is . that ' s what he taught us . i guess what it really was about was . the privilege of sacrifice . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t that right ?
that ' s right .
<person> ?
what ? !
is this the chiefs ' recommendation ?
yes , sir . our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational . the invasion happens eight days later .
how would you know ?
just doesn ' t , that ' s all .
darndest thing , i dream about me .
then i ' ll have a tuna sandwich .
yeah . excuse me .
you care which bed ?
what are all these numbers here ? i ' m not familiar with all these section violations .
it is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the home improvement laws , and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state .
i ' m somebody . lem me out and i ' ll take care of your baby .
no . <person> put you in there for a reason . i ' ll wait for somebody else .
<person> out <person> . <continued_utterance> no direct approach on the mother or the daughter .
no . <person> was a battered wife and <person> was a suborned whore . if that ' s not motive , what is ? you want answers then we brace those two hard .
i ' ll bet . <person> , <person> . why don ' t you come by this weekend . we ' ll take the boat out .
<person> , <person> . i ' ve got plans .
all of them .
i feel sorry for them . <person> ' t that ridiculous ?
i don ' t see any eyes . must be totally subterranean . and those tentacles .
i think they shoot right outta its mouth , hook you , and pull you right in . <person> thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else .
and i kicked ass . my best stuff . then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition . and i cried .
she ' s making this up .
as a matter of fact , it is .
remember the bowling ball bag <person> carried with him in virtual reality ?
<person> , it ' s not the interview -- i mean i am nervous about it -- but that ' s not what ' s bugging me . it ' s . him .
him who ? <person> ?
i ' m placing your daughter under arrest .
you can ' t .
it ' s no place for <person> about a pig sty ! now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia !
yes ' am .
greetings ! i am <person> ! i come in peace !
tell us ! what is it like outside ?
hey , this is a pretty nice place .
sully . ! what the fuck happened here ? !
jesus <person> !
no !
i ' m kidding . <person> ?
oh . right . ha . <person> , about last night . there is something i need to tell .
not `` whatever . `` it ' s two different things .
he cared enough to want you to have it .
so . what happened ?
my mother says in this really low , but very awake kind of voice `` what ? '' <person> and <person> crack up .
. hey , i don ' t need your charity .
. i get these people to trust you -- they ' re coming here tomorrow by the way -- i get this expert doctor to talk to you . i ' m doing all your fuckin ' legwork -- and it ' s eighteen months . you ' re ' sposed to be in court . i bet you haven ' t even seen the file .
who took it ?
<person> said , the tax man . gave me a dollar to tell you so .
i am just a middle man . i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner .
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss .
i got money .
i ' ll pay you a thousand dollars . i have it in my wallet .
<person> . <continued_utterance> do we blame ourselves for that ? the bad dialogue ? or would it be bad no matter who was ported in ?
the game engine is just getting used to us . it ' ll get more daring once it warms up .
i called you before . about the man who keeps calling me ?
oh , yeah .
<person> , alright , alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world . go get a tail on <person> , and stay with her . <person> ' s gon na show . and i want you to make the collar . <continued_utterance> <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' ll sleep around a little .
thanks , <person> .
yeah !
now go get molly . your friends are going to be here any minute .
i was not charming .
well , you
i didn ' t forget .
you ever look down on them again and call them `` grocers '' like it ' s a dirty word , and you ' ll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . got it ?
let me ask you this : when you smoke a cigar , do you ever pretend it has balls ?
come on , that wouldn ' t make me gay .
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . <person> rude . they seem to think we are quaint .
<person> ? can ' t imagine why . <continued_utterance> where ' s the nearest telephone ?
<person> .
<person> .
<person> department is <person> ?
i dunno . she ' s there somewhere . yeah , on the third floor .
overruled .
exception !
maybe if you did a little less partyin ' that little girl would still be alive .
is that right , mr . <person> ?
i know you are , honey . ah , well -- it wasn ' t fire , and nobody bled , so i guess we ' re okay . <continued_utterance> yes . yes . yes , i know . you ' re right . all right , yes . in an hour , then .
who was that ? <continued_utterance> who was that ?
any idea how much ?
i ' ve read official estimates but i wouldn ' t bet my house on them . i ' ve heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers . at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who don ' t give a damn if they ' re caught or not .
how did you find out ?
like any housekeeper -- i read the carbon paper . bring him the mail .
does it work on cash machines ?
it was an authorized test . i returned the money .
all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . <person> ? you happy ? so now what ?
so now you ' ve got to talk him out of it . and then we ' ve got to figure out an acceptable political solution .
you are home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , i ' ll be your point person here on the magazine .
really ? you ' d do that for me ?
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate .
<person> , right ?
objection !
and you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you ' d ruin their lives .
there ' s a beautiful , whoa , a very beautiful girl .
yes .
the
no , that ' s the coup de vieux .
no you weren ' t .
i was , you bastard . <continued_utterance> so what ' ve we got today ?
why didn't you send <person> ?
maybe i did . <person> first . <person> cant ever stop talkin bout that town .
for climbing .
break it out .
<person> , you ' re right . the kid has man strength , dude .
man strength ?
yes .
i haven ' t been able to recall a single moment of that day . until now .
where is he ? <continued_utterance> i . please . my wife . my wife ' s prescription has run out . if i can call him .
dr . <person> ' s taking all his .
yeah . sure did .
<person> . i hate that ! i hate bein ' called a beaver , don ' t you ?
what about hard work ?
what about it ? you work hard . i ' ll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought . and where ' d it get you ? . my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies . and he dropped dead at <number> with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house ; my mom ended up working in a dish factory . <person> up pal , if you ' re not inside you ' re outside . and i ' m not talking a $ <number> , <number> a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being `` comfortable '' , i ' m talking rich pal , rich enough to fly in your own jet , rich enough not to waste time , <number> - <number> million , a player bud -- or nothing . you had what it takes to let through my door . next question : you got what it takes to stay . ? ? <continued_utterance> look out there . <continued_utterance> you really think the difference ' tween this guy and that guy is luck ? <person> , pull over . <continued_utterance> . when it comes to money , sport , everybody ' s of the same religion . or should be . hope you don ' t mind if i let you off here , i ' m late for a meeting . <person> bye , nice knowing you .
gee , i don ' t know . <person> . i don ' t seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite <number> people over to trash my living room .
sometimes we have to improvise . <continued_utterance> <person> ? my <person> ? what ' s happened ?
he hears . everything .
as a matter of fact , i do .
i was aware of his sexual predilections .
. and someone else ' s .
<person> .
twenty six pounds .
i ' m sure whatever you do will look wonderful , honey . <person> beams then goes back to his organizer .
after the interview we ' ll take a celebration sail around lake , then friday -- my birthday -- we ' ll have wonderful meal at digby ' s . <continued_utterance> <person> , are you going to spend all summer driving us crazy with that ?
not interested .
they were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases . they also found this . i think we ignore the old ways at our peril , don ' t you ?
no friends , huh ? that ' s funny , i don ' t know no u . s . <person> that comes without no friends . that ' s cuz u . s . <person> is pussies . they always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see-in-the-dark glasses . so don ' t you tell me you all alone out here , my friend . you bullshitting the wrong guy .
who ' s writing this dude ' s dialogue ?
maybe you should wait for august .
i want to dance now !
oh yeah ?
ill slap those eyes right outta your head . <continued_utterance> <person> , baby . whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin ?
i just did . you ' re buying . <person> fishes for change , but more out of sportsmanship .
<person> . what ' ll it be : <person> , <person> ?
nowhere . i ' m trying to find her .
you got <person> . let her go .

oh , right . yes . <person> says the guy ' s a sweetheart . <person> ' t hurt a fly .
huh .
i spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt ' s got skeletons . <continued_utterance> shoplifting in bakersfield at <number> . prostitution arrest at <number> . <person> associate of a kern county homicide victim , this convicted pimp named <person> , probably her pimp . <person> to death in his home , weapon never recovered-
forget it . burn it , s ' not important now .
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case ?
i ' m not a stalker ! she ' s a friend of mine .
neither does he . that ' s where he loses . this man ' s scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i don ' t want the archdiocese exposed .
yes , but how often ? tell me , are you happy ?
am i happy ? i don ' t know . <person> the next man , i guess . i don ' t laugh all day long like an idiot , if that ' s what you mean .
before we do this , i just want to say that a good life ' s got ta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list . <continued_utterance> it ' s about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know , spontaneously .
what are you talking about ?
<person> ' t get so upset <person> . though your handwriting is egregious , you have a fairly decent vocabulary . although , <person> is not an `` affected twit . `` <person> snatches the journal out of her hands .
those are my private thoughts and are none of your business !
he ' s still a little warm . <continued_utterance> yuck . <continued_utterance> that ' s a . big trunk . it fits a tuba , a <continued_utterance> whose tuba is that anyway ?
<person> ' s .

admiral , i asked you a question .
we ' re going to follow the rules of engagement . the rules of engagement which the president has approved and signed in his order of october <number> rd . <continued_utterance> yes , captain , you may proceed . clear your guns .
but not before . not us .
no . the memory will keep me company .
say no more . <continued_utterance> federal bureau of investigation , <person> . i ' d like to ask you a few questions about <person> .
she only worked here a month . nice
i don ' t know how to even tell you this without being embarrassed for myself . it was an accident . it ' s like one of those things out of the blue . it ' s crazy . you can ' t explain it . it happens .
<person> , what is he talking about ?
oh , ted , duh . i smile at everyone since i got my braces off .
so you ' ll think about it ?
well . her store was very close to our store , and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost --
why ?
you always get like this when you smoke .
no . last night i couldn ' t sleep , so i just laid there looking up at the sky , counting the stars . there were over seventy . <person> makes you think , doesn ' t it ?

<person> !
we ' re not after car thieves here .
what the hell am i after ? you ' re telling me dick .

someone wants to kill me , i ' d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
i wish ! he just kept psychoanalyzing everything . my dolls were alter egos . boys who wanted to kiss me were oedipally fixated adolescents looking to displace their mothers on their aboriginal family totems .
sounds like my friends to a tee . you seem to be doing okay now .
his agent lied .
you interested ?
i don ' t think you ' re being fair , sir . you assigned me this guy , and you know he ' s got a history .
somebody has to pay for that error . and it ' s not me .
just tell me what you want .
i dont need to explain anymoren i have . you know damn well .
' <person> ' .
it ' s a common medical term .
i don ' t know . i just ran .
how did you two get separated ? you were so close on the dance floor .
<person> <number> , you ' ve got runway one , you are cleared to proceed to <person> <number> .
<person> that .
<person> , i ' m as conniving as they come , but a sneak attack is just wrong .
he ' s right . and things are happening too fast . it smells like the bay of pigs all over again .
<person> , trust me on this one . call it part of his mental preparation for the open , where the rough is deep , the greens are slick , and the nerves are shattered . i ' ll take the bet .
oh , jeez .
<person> , with a finish in about a decade . <continued_utterance> so you ' re talking to me ?
when i have something to say .
it ' s called pasta now <person> , spaghetti ' s out of date .

will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she ' s nothing to you ? right out loud so i can hear ? tell her she ' s nothing , tell her she ' s nobody , just dirt ? will you do that ? <continued_utterance> until you can do that we ' ve got nothing to talk about , <person> . nothing . now leave me alone .
i was wandering through existenz - the new system , i mean . i like it in there . of course , without another player you ' re only a tourist . it ' s frustrating .
why won ' t you let me contact <person> ? they ' ve got to be going crazy , wondering what ' s happened to you . i mean , it ' s not like we ' ve done something wrong . we just ran because we didn ' t know how many of them there were , right ? i think we owe it to <person> to let them know you ' re all right , to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he ' s doing . and besides , i can ' t . i can ' t just keep doing this , whatever it is , you know , forever , not having any idea when it ' s going to be . <continued_utterance> hey , what are you doing ?
part of him is .
if we find <person> , <person> won ' t be far behind .
thank you .
what i admire are the details , the invention , the little lies all around the big one . it takes talent .
but <person> --
please .
i think you ' re missing your dad . the anniversary was yesterday , wasn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> you got sand in your cuffs .

i didn ' t think so . <continued_utterance> boo ! you see , i can ' t even scare a crow ! they come from miles . mcu -- <person> listening -- scarecrow o . s . <continued_utterance> oh , i ' m a failure , because i haven ' t got a brain . mcu -- <person> reacts , speaks --

i ' m really sorry i didn ' t --
<person> is why i think in the calm cold light of day , we should both think real hard about whether or not you really want to continue on here at merchants national trust .
i ' ve come alone and unarmed .
to what end ?
i got held up . believe me , it is not something i make a habit of .
i ' m sure it ' s not . actually -- could you just , could you close that door for me ? thanks .
the hospital . ?
no records since she quit in ' <number> . she quit two weeks after the incident .
<person> . i just figured it ' s old .
well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows .
we figure the perpetrator let him out . he ' s blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over .
the perpetrator .
please deposit an additional seventy-five cents . <person> slams the phone against the hook .
<person> rat ' s ass fuck ! <person> ! <person> ! <person> ! <person> !

i won ' t even discuss it .
no one ' s discussing it . i ' m just gon na run <person> home . i ' ll be right back .
<person> ' s just say i ' m sending a very clear message to his reelection rally .
<person> ' t you going to watch with me ?
that shows me already that you don ' t have a clue . what ' s it to you , anyway ?
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .
why can ' t i just do it my own way ?
you can .
. most eloquently put , <person> .
thank you , general li . now i ' ll just sign this last document -
<person> .
because no matter how much you claim to `` love '' me , you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of <person> !
do whatever you want .
oh , does that make you mad ?
hey , are we talking about the same thing ?
i ' m losing my patience .
depends how much your baby weighs .
oh right , how much she weighs .
<person> .

you know how much man power you ' re talking about ?
you ' re the highest law enforcement official in the country . use the fucking army if you need to .

she was with me .
<person> ' t give up so quickly . <continued_utterance> thanks .
my name is <person> .
ma ' am , i ' ve been called a lot of things -- but no one ' s ever saddled me with that one .
you might try being saddled sometime -- the smell of leather , the sting of a whip .
skip that word .
yes , sir . it certainly was a surprise hearing from you . your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine . of course you ' ve got plenty of time to be amusing , sitting on that porch , rocking away , while we put in a full day ' s work . you always were a lucky stiff , and i envy you . a few years more , i was saying to emmy the other evening , and i ' m going to be able to take it easy like old tom .
you loaded the songs . you tell me ?
must be a mistake .
well , after i worked on him -- thought i ' d let him rest . left the room for a bit . when i came back , he was gone .
well , where was he ? where did he go ?
i was just baiting him ! <person> , i had to tell him that to get his guard down . just like you told <person> you was going to kill me !
you lied to me all along ! lies , all lies . your mother , your father , what story are you on now ? how come the town didn ' t know you was his daughter ? grace cause my mom slept around . a lotta men ! anybody could ' ve been my father . but
that strikes me as odd .
<person> is odd . i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights . i dropped him there once , but . come to think of it , it-wasn ' t even his aunt ' s house . he said she worked there . or something . i don ' t remember .
you heard me . my friend here has a bioport problem .
a bioport , now , that ' s a sort of a hole in your spine , isn ' t it ? lotta assholes `round here , but that ' s generally it . i don ' t know why you ' d be talking to me about that , lady .
but why ? i can ' t understand how i could just completely --
it was maybe a week after the accident .
and just what makes you so sure it was me ?
who the hell else would write such a thing ? <continued_utterance> and just how do you explain this ?
why ?
i don ' t know . my friends are here . i like the scenery . i don ' t know .
<person> , you look so -- gold . how ' s it going ?
how ' s it going ? i just had my whole body painted by a fat guy with no balls , and believe me , he was very thorough , if you know what i mean . how ' s it going with you ?
something book of the dead .
tibetan . it ' s not a how-to manual . it ' s an <number> th century buddhist guide on death and dying .
was there anything in those offices that didn ' t go to d . c . ?
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . we thought there ' d been another fatality , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
oh , dear -- that was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you couldn ' t come to <person> with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart .
<person> ? why , that ' s a long and dangerous journey . and it might rain on the way .
i thought your specialty was good-bye .
oh , <person> . i ' ve missed you -
could be .
<person> , what are you doing ?
well , as i said , you can always reach me . you ' ve got my card , and when the time comes , let ' s talk . <continued_utterance> hey , give my best to your little son . wonderful kid there . what ' s his name again , <person> ?

<person> . i own this store .
i ' m calling the police .
so help me god you touch that phone and i bury you with them . surrender is no longer an option . i repeat -- it is not an option . is there anyone who does not understand that ? <continued_utterance> a little gut check time fellas . a time for some serious self- exploration . how do i function ? for real ? no more bullshit . can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas ? when they won ' t play my fucking song ? etc , etc . do you get me ? do you get me ?
you get this straight , you son of a bitch , you owe me sixteen plus . i want sixteen plus .
am i trying to shirk my responsibility ? that ' s not the way i see it . it was a fluke , a crazy thing that happened , but i stand behind my honor on this .
. and her heart stopped and she wasn ' t getting oxygen .
that ' s right .
but you don ' t refuse to believe in them because of that ?
not if i can see the proof with my own eyes .
no . no .
dig deep , <person> . dig deep . you cried out for <person> . what do you remember about <person> ? show me your face , <person> . help me . open the door . <person> rises and goes to the prison window . angle on mccabe <continued_utterance> it ' s true you had an accident . it ' s true you were disfigured , but not anymore . do you remember ? ! they did fix your face . <person> off that mask , <person> . you ' ll see your face is perfect under there .

entertainment . the susan lucci section or banal love songs of the nineties ?
banal love songs it is . hey , you wan na try something ?
with all due respect , mr . secretary , we were not firing on the ship . firing on a ship means attacking the ship . we were not attacking the ship . we were firing over it .
this was not the president ' s intention when he gave that order . what if the soviets don ' t see the distention ? what if they make the same mistake i just did ? there will be no firing anything near any soviet ships without my express permission , is that understood , admiral ?
<person> .
what do you think our chances are ?
oh yeah , pretty boy ? and what about <person> ?
would you marry us both , <person> ?
yeah . i ' ll bet . <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' m tired of nicaragua .
you haven ' t been here very long .
<person> .
<person> .
he ' s spoken of you . he says you ' re becoming friends .
we are . <continued_utterance> he ' s doing well today .
you ' re still with us though . you ' re somewhere on the face of the earth ?
well , we ' re not in the middle of nowhere , but we can see it from here .
- and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake .
have we met ?
no , i don ' t . good men don ' t wind up with much in the end except their goodness . <person> ' t worth much , is it ?
see ? . look what we ' ve done to you already . <continued_utterance> <person> .
i don ' t believe how much she ' s grown ! <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> , hello my darling . <continued_utterance> how beautiful she is . her hair has grown . <person> how much she changed , i missed it all . i missed her so much ! <continued_utterance> i wanted to make life difficult for <person> but i never thought i ' d miss her so much .

<person> again if there ' s any problem .
thank you .

yeah . you ' re awake ?
-- i know . i fed it , and i can ' t get rid of --
you weren ' t sent here to go off on your own detail , <person> . you were sent here to assist in a selective operations <person> . these regional agents are inept -- that ' s why they were sent out here to the graveyard , to indian country . i need you behind me , <person> . not pulling against me .
<person> -- run !
first we must pray to <person> for forgiveness . <continued_utterance> on second thought , <person> ' s often busy .
you all gon na go down to the caribbean together ? <continued_utterance> the thing about it is , threesomes so rarely work out .
you ' re out of your mind .
. going places , good junk bond department , you got the financing on that syndicam deal .
. <person> , and we ' re working on some other interesting stuff .
but i out-hustle him , right ?
right .
i think you ' d be making a big mistake if you married him .
it ' s not for you to make decisions for me .
i don ' t know what you know . why don ' t you go ask your girlfriend about it ?
she ' s my wife , <person> . so that ' s it ? i stay with tess and i never get to see you guys again ? not a single phone call ? nothing ? <continued_utterance> god , man , i don ' t understand this . you won ' t forgive me , but you ' ll forgive <person> ?
<person> . now listen to me , asshole . i ' m giving you a break . but if my partner finds out you ' re here , you ' re gon na be reading rat tracks in sioux falls <person> .
<person> . <person> . i ' m goin ' . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> . <continued_utterance> you weigh one sixty-three , yeah ? not a beer drinker . you ' re one of these tofu and pilaf characters . pack your gun , under your coat -- left shoulder . but you got backup ; a little . <number> , . <number> maybe , in a ankle holster that gives you a right foot drag , shoes are too tight at the toe but , man , they look cool . and that ' s what counts .
just a few tokens of my affection .
everything is lovely , ted , but much too expensive .
no , i mean
-- there ' s this one kid , we call him <person> on account of he ' s a mongoloid . he got out of his cage once and --
that thought makes me feel awful .
<person> ' t you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . <person> ' t you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?
you not going to listen to me ? you don ' t care i ' m trying to help ?
i think i ' m gon na get penalized for slow play if you don ' t give me that fucking driver .
tolerably well . i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses .
it is so considerate of you .
-everyone knows i ' m a piece-a-shit . what are you proving ? <person> ' s the guy flanking you right now . the guy who ' s vulnerable right now .
you ' re all angles and graft <person> . why trust a god damn word that comes out of your-

she ' s okay . she ' s pretty .
i hate changing schools .

i am <person> . <continued_utterance> i see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school . <person> is a cultural wasteland compared to india . though some of the girls are very attractive .
what , i ' m the in-flight entertainment ?
that ' s how this ride-sharing thing works . division of labor . we split everything fifty-fifty . get it ?
you ' re the one who doesn ' t care , <person> .
it hurts too much to care .
<person> shit , i ' ve been going out with a loaded gun !

you sandbagged me on bluestar . i guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson , that you can make the tail wag the dog , huh ? <continued_utterance> well let me cue you in : the ice is melting under your feet sport . <continued_utterance> you think you could ' ve gotten this far this fast with anybody else ? you think you could be out there dicking somebody like <person> ? no , you ' d be cold calling dentists and widows to buy twenty shares of some dog stock ! i took you in ! a nobody ! i opened doors for you ! . i showed you how the system works ! . <continued_utterance> . the value of information ! how you get it ! <person> , brant resources , <person> , <person> . and this is how you pay back , you cockroach ! i gave you <person> , i gave you your manhood . i gave you everything . <continued_utterance> you could ' ve been one of the great ones bud . i look at you and see myself . why ?
i don ' t know . my dad once told me , `` money is something you need in case you don ' t die tomortow . `` i guess i realized i ' m just <person> . and as much as i wanted to be <person> gekko -- i ' ll always be <person> .
what the hell does that mean ?
just give her some of <person> ' s money and send her home . he ' s not gon na miss it . he ' s in happy land .
then will you take me on your friends ' boat with you ?
i ' m not sailing his boat .
nonetheless , your honor , we feel that our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law .

<person> , fine .

and you think he could find out her number for me ?
i told you -- i have a date .
you rotten bastard -- do you see me going out on any dates ?
i can ' t help myself . i don ' t know what ' s the matter with me .
<person> , <person> , you ' re hungover . what do you think ' s the matter with you ?
partly because i didn ' t want to hurt you . but partly . partly because i was relieved .
relieved ?

no sir , that would ' ve been illegal .
i already did . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t sleep .
<person> .
yeah . i ' m thinking about <person> ' s <person> fixation . you know how <person> was always harping `` immaculate reception ? '' i ' ve seen that play . a lot of times . and i have to say this . <person> was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that ' s it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ?
i guess .
a tooth .
stop ! <person> !
it has been a thousand years .
things change so fast here . you leave for a millennium , and it ' s like the whole neighborhood ' s gone . <continued_utterance> perhaps we should split up .

she said lots of thing . s
three weeks before midterm elections ? you need me .
well . there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about .
my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs .
that ' s refreshingly deviant .
<person> , of course , ' cause after the <number> : <number> bottle it starts all over again around nine .
and by the time i change her and play with her a little , it ' s already eight o ' clock .
who do you think did it ?
has anybody asked his wife ? she ' s the one i hope did it .
<person> , hi , how are you ? come on in . <person> down .
i am so sorry i was late .
and if we refuse ?

my name ' s bernice . <person> .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> ?
hit it .
<person> , i am your friend .
i know you are and you don ' t have to do anything crazy to prove it .
if your neighbors didn't mind , howd you get put out of business ?
woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . she called the police and they came over and arrested me . thought i was a sniper ! boys at the vfw loved that one . <person> didn't understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . i was gon na put out poison , but i was afraid somebodys cat would eat it . <person> , i had six cats myself . so i used the . <number> because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap .
you will or you won ' t . <person> ' t look to me . i ' m going to sleep .
go wake up virgil .
i ' m certain of it . i ' m not giving away four hundred dollars for my health . i ' m a businessman , and i ' m a good businessman . this is good business for me . i ' m giving it away ' cos i believe in this house , believe that it will refer me to other jobs which means money in my pocket , which means money in your pocket .
you got a deal , mr . <person> . <continued_utterance> something wrong , sir ?
you ' ve had it , <person> ! throw out your weapon if you want a past !
there ' s an explosive in the clipboard ! he has a dead-man switch in his hand !
not about this , august .
all right , let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth ?
a freeway , mr . <person> , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l . a . to <person> . <person> to <person> . <person> to <person> . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l . a . <person> to another .
that ' s what this is all about ? tell me , who ' s gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
well that ' s just typical isn ' t it ?
is it true <person> ?
no . i was being unrealistic . even thinking about living this life .
you ' re so sure of that ?
no , you wait right there for me . <person> be on the piedmont flight tomorrow at seven . meet me at the airport .
<person> meet you , <person> , if thats what you want , but im against it .

excuse me .
you don ' t remember ? two days ago i gave you my meatball sandwich in the park . you were in a wheelchair . same sneakers .

i hear the humming . <person> electricity .
you ' re not the only one who suffered , <person> . i didn ' t even know she was sick . i never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother . you had no right to keep that from me ! that was not your decision to make !
you know what ? you walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you ' re all , i forgive you , i forgive <person> . i forgive everyone . but you know what ? you ' re full of shit .

just a second .
<person> .
no . no . no . no . i had my child at cedars and sinai . and that ain ' t no county hospital . you have to have cash or check before you come in the door .
some folks take that natural stuff too far .
well it feels like it . i ' m leaving her another message .
now ?
it ' s all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation . <person> , you ' re still going to be president . and when the time comes , you ' ll parachute out a rich man . with the money you ' re going to make , your father won ' t have to work another day in his life .
tell me , <person> -- when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ?
you ' ll not get that one in a harness , let alone pulling a plow . even drunk on a tuesday night , you know that . and i can ' t wait for the money - there ' s a war coming . <person> stands up from his chair , resolute .
i promise you that field will be plowed . we ' ll plant it with turnips . and the money will be yours when harvest comes . mrs . <person> interjects , desperate .
<person> thinking . what ' s all this ?
i ' m not coming back . bobby awright , let ' s go . i want to be fifty miles from here before the sun comes up . <continued_utterance> funny thing ; the jeep wouldn ' t start . i had to push it . bobby funny thing . i ' ll get the bags .

he has a son in pennsylvania . <person> . we ' re playing there in three weeks . that ' s all he needs .
i was right about you . you ' re going blow us all up . <person> got home tonight before you and <person> . people are talking . <continued_utterance> i shouldn ' t be a clown . i should be a goddamn fortune teller .
a laugh can be a powerful thing , <person> . sometimes it ' s the only weapon we have in life .
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety .
but daddy .

i know . <person> sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin , and this dont help soothe me .
<person> ' t no one never said i was a pussy .

something was there . you saw it .
and whaddya wan na be when ya grow up ?
a waiter .
you said to ' trust my feelings ' !
i didn ' t know you felt like breaking all the clubs in your bag .
forget it . we don ' t talk about anything personal . we made a rule about that . i don ' t know his name , what he does or exactly where he lives , so it will be really easy to stop seeing him , because i ' m not .
god , he could be the next person to talk into the store . he could be . <person> . george pappas , in his twenties , one of <person> ' s
why don ' t you come to town this weekend ? we could play some golf , chase some skirts .
i ' d love to , but i really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and i ' ve been slacking .
we should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths .
<person> .
oh , you ' d be surprised .
we ' ve kept your father ' s chair free .
indulged him ? i have indulged him ? <continued_utterance> he ' s a grown man who makes his own decisions .
but he does not need to buy it .
<person> funny , though , isn ' t it ? we ' re not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you ' ve done your job , x , head back to <person> . i ' ll be landing in <number> minutes . this is my operation now .
you heard from reggie ?
<person> called . they're stayin another week .

no , you ' re not ! i don ' t trust any of you !
when you see <person> , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in . the sooner we back off this reservation . <person> ?
<person> says you come from heavy indian blood . i used to think <person> was gettin ' senile . now i know he is .

and exactly what business are you in , mr . <person> ?
<person> yo talk and get out and push .
<person> , no .
no . i ' m afraid it is what you did . <continued_utterance> when i took her she was . promise itself . so clever , so vibrant , so . full of life force . and you left her there , at the mercy of a man like me . you ruined her . for what ? to get to me ? she is worth fifty of me .
for once , i agree with you . <continued_utterance> so she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father , on me .
i fucked her ' til her nose bled .
sure you did ! oh , <person> , you ' re rich .
they ' re in the ignition , silly . <continued_utterance> you do know how to drive ?
i don ' t have much experience with a . uh . stick .
i know . <person> drives toward the ramp . he looks at her .
do you know why ?
tell <person> if i get minute-
-yer gon na have to make a minute for him . now . <person> , we think the spade might testify that <person> owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gon na tank . a fight everybody woulda ' got flush off of , including the spade . have him look out the window <person> .
that ' s not my handwriting .
you ' ve just said you signed it .

even if they are iraqis probably all they ' ll do is take us prisoner for awhile . <person> to figure we ' re still kicking their asses in the war . they don ' t want any trouble .
<person> , they ' ll probably just surrender to us . probably .
you didn ' t have one .
but i did . he was a great man , a leader of the church . and his example inspired me to dedicate my life to <person> ' s service .
<person> ' t it go to any office ?
no , for that much money i have to tell them exactly which office . i know , i ' ve had to have money wired to me on the road . and there has to be a code word or they won ' t give it to you . i ' ll have to tell you the code .

but the good witch of the north told me not to .
they won ' t figure it out .

there ' s nothing unholy about expressing one ' s emotions . on the contrary . religion should be experienced in a passionate , all- embracing way . we should feel free to express our spirituality .
yes , darling !
yes , sir . but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division . he has proposed an additional <number> million dollar payment .
. and there ' s no truth that <number> % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?

there ' s the ruins of an old house or something back in the woods .
oh . give me the duct tape .
well , it ' s a lot better than all this `` why do you think you ' re in this situation '' psychological bullshit you hear all the time .
well . why do you think you ' re in this situation ?
never would ' ve pegged you as a pussy , <person> . even when <person> and <person> called it , i always defended your ass .
<person> ' t no one never said i was a pussy .
depends how you look at it . i mean it ' s not like anybody ' s holding a gun to their heads .

oh , yeah . <person> lookin ' guy like him .
<person> thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me . <continued_utterance> you ' ve really got me confused , <person> . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew . and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i ' m not following your evolution .
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gim me a break . you ' re not interested in my past , you ' re interested in my future as some kind of spy .
i have no idea .
maybe you should go to bed .
what in the hell were they doing . ? flying that low . shooting at a dog . at us .
stir crazy . <person> fever . who knows .
no .
interesting .
<person> . <person> disappointing .
<person> ?
you must influence her to send you away . i feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part .
what do you want me to do ?
i ' m not going left of those trees . i ' m going over those trees . with a little draw . that way i get home in two . that way i ' m putting for eagle .
you don ' t need eagle to qualify ! you need to get used to playing smart -- no mistakes wins the open .
<person> testing . or , no , bio- engineering ! the government built them , a <continued_utterance> maybe it is . why don ' t you take a little stroll and see ?

four times , <person> ! that means something . four times .
stop the car !
i hope we ' re not too early . may we come in ?
sure . i thought by the fireplace .
times are hard for everybody . and i guess because . out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you don ' t want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight , comes . so much beauty .
that ' s beautifully put . <continued_utterance> toss him off , <person> . and make sure you see the red light before you red light him . <continued_utterance> another sonny boy mad at mommy and daddy for paying the bills . sounds like he studied poetry .
but i never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what <person> and i are going to teach you all tonight .

oh , i ' m sure he ' s there . you ' re just not looking hard enough .
he ' s not here , <person> . <person> ' s gone .

if her ass gets red , tell her not to listen to any pediatricians -- they ' re full of shit .
right . full of shit .
well , you ' d best get something . even if they didn ' t do it , it times out that they most likely witnessed it . i want somebody to at least talk to ' em . put out an apb with a description and see what we get back .
<person> .
in the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda '' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you didn ' t even know it was there .
i don ' t believe i know where the upstairs guest room is .
well then . i ' d better show you . <person> --
<person> , but he was successful .
let me ask you this : when you smoke a cigar , do you ever pretend it has balls ?
i ' ve always believed if done right , armed robbery doesn ' t have to be a totally unpleasant experience .
god . you ' re a real live outlaw !
you know , i did come home , come to think of it , on thursday . i had a severe headache and i was driving in the neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house . where were you , <person> ? i didn ' t see you ?
i was down the street .
he ' s right there !
so if you ' re not treating him while he ' s here , then he ' s not a patient while he ' s here , is he ? and i have the right to see him !
absolutely .
well then this is a vital piece of equipment . used properly , it can change your life . <person> , you cruise . no racing . this ain ' t a ferrari . you check out the scenery , let the scenery check you out . you got to take it slow . old cars are like good women . they heat up fast .
you ' ll never make that stick .
they ' re carrying guns in town .
i love you .
because it ' s true .
yes , washington sent me , <person> . they sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked . do you know what i mean when i say this whole thing has been fucked , <person> ? <continued_utterance> an arrangement was made between you . and us . do you remember that arrangement ?
i ' m here , ain ' t i ?
you have a king fantasy .
i am a lover . in africa , you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night .
<person> . not indicted . he resigned the firm . divorced nineteen seventy . <person> worked with <person> until <person> retired in ' seventy- eight . since then he ' s been on his own . four cases before the circuit court . he lost them all . he drinks .
four cases in three years .
we thought maybe you ' d have that kind of information for us .
this is a very different proposition .
clearings ? neither will give you much in the way of clearings . but , there ' s another path , this one here . timber falls . its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you ' ll ever see .
sounds perfect . <person> ?
no sir , that would ' ve been illegal .
can we have the check over here for christ ' s sake .
i ' ll fight you rotten-
-and maybe salvage something that ' s a close cousin to `respect . ' but what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures ?
yeah , right . real clever . <person> , here . she ' s all yours . <person> luck .
<person> , i got it . you can take her out now .
<person> ?
yes ?
just like that then ?
just like that .
i ' ve got a lot of work to do . i don ' t want you coming over !
you know what your problem is , <person> , is you ' re so straight . i really mean that . you go to a private school , you wear a bra . no one can have a good time with you ! you know , <person> asked me to go out with him this weekend , and i was really really tempted because i like <person> . a lot . as much as you do . but i told him i couldn ' t , that i didn ' t think it was right because you were my friend --
you think she ' ll turn him in this time ?
i don ' t know . <continued_utterance> i do know however , that you are very smitten with her .
by who ?
i think <person> or <person> .
i think he ' s not the first husband you killed . i once knew a man , one of the counts of <person> . he told me a story . of beauty and danger . he was the bravest man i ' ve ever known . and the saddest .
i know .
well . yeah .
how long were you with the dog ? alone , i mean ?
i didn ' t quit my old team . i got thrown off .
why ?
you probably didn ' t notice , but this bunk has been taken .
<person> got ta problem with that ?
i don ' t want to be safe !
i have to go to work .
<person> . then we ' ll just stand here .
<person> .

yes .
it ' s dangerous . he ' s dangerous . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> .
i ' m sorry . i can ' t take you .
we drape a blanket over the lower bunk for sheeni and me . you tackle <person> on the top bunk . here ' s a condom . i slipped two to lefty , leaving us with four .
what if they don ' t go for it ?
what ? what ' s not funny , thelma !
<person> , but . i can ' t say .
yeah .
wow .
i ' m fine . nice tv .
there ' s an old saying from the everglades -- virtue may be missed but sin can ' t hide . folks pay in the end .
where are the files you stole from sergeant <person> .
<person> . your secret weapon right ? i mean , i know j . <person> is a slanted fuck , but traditionally `vicious fags ' don ' t make the best major case witnesses . i ' m worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility .
copped a tin of altoids at the car wash . dom nods , satisfied .
<person> , sounds like you ' re all set . just clean the pipes and it ' s a go .
there ' s nobody here .
the knights of the pacalcade . the king ' s bravest warriors .
i don ' t know , make some money , <person> some kids , you know .
<person> ' t suit you .
you ' d think so .
<person> ?
i ' m thinking with your game you should go back to the qualifying school , try to get out on tour .
then i wouldn ' t see you .
a hundred horses . five or six wagons . and about six thousand fools .
<person> ? <person> !
i suppose so . she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung , but i dont figure she counted on us takin off together like this . i guess this means youre breakin parole , then ?
you guess ? my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt <person> .
<person> ! a pair of german cutters - in memory of your handsome friend from dusseldorf .
thanks . <continued_utterance> i ' ll use `em back in the garden in south shields . you keep your head down , now , <person> me lad !
why would he contact me ? i just took some lousy pictures .
so you wouldn ' t have any idea where he might be ?
you ' re not going anywhere . you belong here . these animals . they ' ve been waiting for you . <continued_utterance> but don ' t ever disobey me like that again . i ' ll give you this one . i ' ll call it `` respect '' . next one i call `` betrayal '' . <person> ? <continued_utterance> i do thank you though . you and <person> solved a much bigger problem for me .
what problem ?
all right . <person> your door . <person> ' t let anybody in , no matter what .
<person> .
well , he ' s got good taste . <person> ' t it the most wonderful thing you ever tasted ? i mean ever .
it ' s delicious --
that ' s <person> . do you know who that is ?
oh , yeah , yes , etc .
this has nothing to do with journalism -- there is more to the world than journalism . we are going to end this war with you or without you . people don ' t really believe in <person> -- they believe in the idea of <person> , no ? because for now the idea of <person> is enough for the people of nicaragua . when the war is over -- none of this matters .
i don ' t do things . like this .
how come bioports don ' t get infected ? i mean , they open right into your body .
<person> to what you ' re saying , <person> . <person> ' t be ludicrous .
<person> , you still got it . hey , tomorrow maybe i ' ll go down to probate court and see who ' s sniffin ' around <person> ' s estate ?
yeah , do that . i ' m gon na go rattle <person> ' s cage .
i met them before you were born .
and i ' d like to introduce you to mr .
i was talking about science , not magic !
<person> ' s just science we don ' t understand yet . <person> . <person> .

no .
<person> , but . . .
that ' s coming right from the president , captain .
-you know who <person> is ?
. yeah . <person> ' s snitch .
its none of my business , but when are you and <person> gon na tie the knot ? i always wondered why you never did .
not for lack of love , i can tell ya that .
mrs . <person> is it true your husband has ordered a hit on <person> ?
carl <person> sits on the board of the children ' s hospital . he is heavily involved with <person> . he has a small boy and another child on the way . if you spread this kind of innuendo , you can expect legal recourse . are we clear on this point ?
a generator blew . nothing to worry about . but i need one last shot of you . why don ' t you stand by the alarm ?
no problem .
you know what your problem is ? you ' re just too adorable .
you know , i think you ' re right . i ' m just too adorable .
<person> does nothin ' without ' em . they ' re it . <person> , even the apache ' re scared of ' em . there ' s a couple right there : <person> and <person> . can always spot a cowboy , they all wear those red sashes .
<person> pretty rough .
answer the question --
i didn ' t sleep with him ! you hear me , you chickenshit bastards -- wham ! she hits the mirror again .
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder .
that thought makes me feel awful .
<person> , i ' m so proud of you .
what ' s the matter ? you don ' t like your food ?
so she hasn ' t changed ?
that i couldn ' t . say . let me ask you something : was she a little <continued_utterance> well she must ' ve packed on a few pounds over the years .
<person> .
in the meantime , you said we were gon na have some fun . so let ' s have some !
you ' re gon na need it , rookie , trust me . <continued_utterance> an all-terrain mobile video monitoring system for surveillance . i call it the `` roach cam '' . see the little camera it ' s got for a head ?
kinda looks like you .
whaddo we do ?
oh , i don ' t know , thelma . i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays . maybe we could have children with the prison guards .
i want to graduate .
you could grace our hallowed halls again , if , while you ' re here , you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
you can ' t blame people for being hungry .
<person> , well , just remember , it ' s the palace that pays you , not the people .
she ' s no innocent . this is my nuclear consultant .
ah , i see . a purely . plutonic relationship . <continued_utterance> really <person> , couldn ' t you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?
no !
well , don ' t do it . the minute you do , they lose all respect for you .
you got enough scratch in there to grease us up with ?
open it . they crowd closer toward her . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
i mean , look how different he looks just since high school . it ' s bad enough i have to get old , but doin ' it with <person> around is only gon na make it worse . i mean , i don ' t think he ' s gon na be very nice about it .
well , now , maybe you won ' t have to .
i just wanted to make you clear on something . personally , i donandiacute ; t care what <person> wants with you . he can take those claws of yours and use them for barbecue skewers . what i do care about is the safety of this group . the professor is in charge , and after the professor , thereandiacute ; s me . so , for the remainder of your time here , youandiacute ; re going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt .
iandiacute ; ve served with men like you before . methodical . systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?
<person> , you are so full of shit .
<person> ' t believe me -- see if i care .

good cop . bad cop .

hardly . i analyze everything to death . every time a guy smiles at me , i ask myself is he really smiling or is he just orally fixated ? when i smile back , i wonder , am i really attracted or just smiling out of some residual cro-magnon instinct ? if i ever actually have sex , i ' m not sure i ' ll know the difference between an orgasm and an anxiety attack !
at that point were you able to fight him off ?
no . he stopped by himself . <person> ? that ' s all . let me go . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t touch me . <person> ' s hands fall to her sides . <person> heads for the door .

not bad . had a little rub and a scrub , now i ' m up for some grub .
that sounds nice -- for you .
you expect more what ?
you ' re going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on `` oprah '' that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them .
no ! it will cave in !
it ' s the only way out .
youre terrible crude sometimes , sailor , you know ?
i cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth .
nothing . <continued_utterance> nothing except three books .
which three books ?
it fried some very expensive nerve boards . <person> ? here . these are kaput . it ' s a complex thing .
nerve boards ?
the worst thing about you , <person> , is you realize the futility of what you ' re doing and you do it anyway . i wish you could see how transparent you are . this food tastes like shit .
so go shower already .
yes .
it means you don ' t talk to anybody . you don ' t draw attention to yourself in any way . do you understand that ? <continued_utterance> tell me you understand that .
we ' re re-modelling .
<person> fuck ! what ' re they doing ?
the archdiocese called , they want to settle . her estate .

it ' s your publicist . he says cbs will come to winnipesaukee .
i knew they ' d come to me ! <person> , not to change the subject but has a psychiatrist ever won the nobel prize ?
there ' s only one problem , <person> . we don ' t know his real name . we just made it up . in fact , we made the whole guy up .
no wonder he screwed us over .
then why the clean overalls ?
it ' s a mental thing . helps me focus . the one thing you don ' t want to do is miss with the stud- finder .
you have something to tell us ?
yeah .
the luggage .
i ' ll get it .
they don ' t particularly . that was my idea . this assignment was boring me to death . the personality they gave you wasn ' t too thrilling .

rinse three times .
to put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works .
i have to get <person> . what if he --
<person> , look at me . you ' ve got a concussion and you ' re on a moving train . there ' s nothing you can do . <person> can handle him . she ' s done it for years .

<person> ' t you worry , young man . i ' ll get right on this . <person> ' t worry . we ' ll light a fire under that deadbeat !
i ' m pretty happy to see me too . so are you done with me yet ?
you ' ve kept up your end of the bargain , i ' ll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
i just didn ' t want to take a chance . i didn ' t want to risk it . it could have been frozen along with everything else .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , <person> .
you ' d be shit out of luck if not for me . you saw what you saw because i led you to it . i ' m putting my ass on the line for you .

it ' s a little different each time . once it looked like , i don ' t know , melted stars , pooling in a corner of the sky . but last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon --
`` racing `` round orion ? '' i ' ve always said you should have been a poet .
let ' s see . that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words . and that other dealers and archeologists don ' t like you much .
those wimps . it ' s because i use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike . i told you to move those crates an hour ago . come on guys , let ' s get going . we realize that a workman is watching them intently from <continued_utterance> you see , a lot of these pieces are from ancient persia . unfortunately , ancient persia is twenty feet under the sand of iran , iraq and syria . not the most popular places lately . so i ' ve had to become an expert in international diplomacy . <continued_utterance> well , do you see anything you like , mr . <person> ?
no -- it feels wonderful . i ' ve held that axe up for ages . oh -- -
oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ?

but that ' s my calling , my purpose , my raison d ' etre . <person>s are supposed to make people laugh . and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
here she goes again .
<person> , that ozone layer is disappearin . <person> to me the government could do somethin about it . one of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an x-ray .
<person> , your links to <person> to <person> , extortion , bribes , murder-for-hire . i ' ll put you in every pair of cross- hairs i can find . i ' ll torch everything you ' ve ever touched . you have no idea how deep i run <person> . and how far i ' m willing to go to fuck you-
-everyone knows i ' m a piece-a-shit . what are you proving ? <person> ' s the guy flanking you right now . the guy who ' s vulnerable right now .
well , i was thinking , we ' ve <person> made a pile of money . maybe we should just pull up <person> and move on . and we could stay on the move , you know ? just keep going , see the world . <person> room service the rest of our lives . how ' d that be ?
wyatt , what ' re you talkin ' about ?
i got it -- you hire a private eye , fly him out there , he follows her around a couple days , she ' ll never know a thing . ted considers this .
no . no fucking way . that ' s too creepy .
but this guy is as bad a choice as you could make . bad choice .
you ' re a good one to give advice . you ' re sitting on the steps , locked out of your house because you can ' t pay your taxes , and you ' re going to give me advice on life ?
. as the advertising says : <person> never lies .
what about the gold ?
maybe .
do you want to issue an apb ?
why ?
i think she ' s acting . i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her . i think maybe she ' s upset that he didn ' t .
unlimited .
from a dea standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds . and cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training .
can i call you in the hamptons if i need you ?
dr . <person> is quite skilled .
you ' re testing my patience , <person> .
a teeny tiny talk . an itty bitty talk . <continued_utterance> pretty please . pretty please with sugar .

' cuz it ' s the only way you can beat <person> . ' cuz you never got over that he is on tour and you are not . ' cuz you get that look on your face .
something coming for you , <person> .
just when i think there ' s hope for you .
so you ' ll think about it ?
you really don ' t get it , do you ? i am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring ! it ' s , like , a caveman thing !
you wan na see my politics ? <continued_utterance> screw the world . if i ' m gon na die for something , it better be bitches and money .
that ' s what i ' m talking about , man ! that ' s why <person> <number> was born . <continued_utterance> to us it means no walls , no speed limits , no jails . it ' s everybody does what he wants . people think democracy is freedom but they don ' t have a clue . there ' s an old punk song . it says : `` america stands for freedom , but if you think you ' re free . ``
it ' s going to be cool , <person> . it ' s all all right .
we go , we get rich , we go home . it ' s that easy .
were you ?
i don ' t know .
i can ' t . it ' s a facial shield . it ' s an antiseptic prosthesis to stop infections . these fucking doctors .

brian . hi . i ' m <person> -- i ' m the lending officer ?
<person> , hi , how are you ? come on in . <person> down .
like a chihuahua ?
those , too , but you know those little hairy ones ? those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth ?
your woman ? i ' m not sure dragging her into the bushes kicking and screaming means you have an actual `` thing '' going .
<person> away .
i told you , most nights i sit on the stool and grade papers , but every now and then i need some action .
<person> , well wait up for me tonight . i ' ll see what i can do about that .
maybe not _a_ thing , but maybe _two_ things .
<person> had a ring . any idea what happened to it ?
i love you too . <person> darling <person> for me .
i have endured a five million dollar beating for nothing . <continued_utterance> i have been stabbed . stabbed in the back . <continued_utterance> i do not have a friend within a hundred miles . this is a daunting thought if you think about it .
' methodology and <person>s of <person> . ' yes .
how old are you ?
so modest .
so sensitive .
fifty cents .
what ? ! !
yeah . now , i want you to look at these photos and then i ' m going to destroy them . <person> ' s testimony is also in here . it won ' t exist . she ' s not going to press charges .
press charges against . me ?
will they ?
it doesn ' t look like it .
i ' ve also fallen in love .
<person> to die for love than to live for it . gentlemen ?
why not ?
i ' m not allowed to date .
and she ' thinks ' she loves you .
it ' s past the thinking stage .
pressing it . do you think we could manage it , <person> ?
it ' s pushing it , bb . what time would your husband be home , ' cos he ' d have to go over the figures with the salesman . that ' s if there ' s a salesman available this evening .
i don ' t know -- i ' m a med student . i ' m just babysitting . i only met her a couple hours ago .
oh , i see . <continued_utterance> <person> , on second thought , i don ' t think i ' ll wait for her . just give her this when she gets back , okay ? and this is for the baby .
so what ? enroll him !
i ' m not enrolling him . he ' s just here until we reach his mother and figure this out .
<person> ' t even .
do you love me ?
our daughter , our only daughter , has fallen for a brilliant manipulator twice her age .
<person> , for god ' s sake talk sense .
any trouble with the rabble ?
not much , sir . a lot of complaining . but they ' re all heading towards the shuttle areas .
no , four is . four is . just hold me .
four is what ?
thank you , your honor . <person> : ms . <person> is a rebuttal witness . as a ' surprise witness ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
i ' m going to uphold that .
we missed the deadline .
<person> ' t we do it on the phone ?
<person> where ?
pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night . chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope , only to find myself standing right where i am right now : at another dead end --
he is in his pigeon cage .
i ' m sorry he got those birds .
all i can say , is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this , ' cos the irs , they don ' t fuck around .
just what i need in my life right now . i ' m in a slump and i ' ve got the irs on me . like when something goes wrong , it ' s like .
how come you ' re not wearing my shoes ?
they ' re too big .
it ain ' t no chili dipper .
<person> , boss , you got the ' s ' word .
but this doesn ' t make any sense , <person> . if it ' s just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days . why the hell didn ' t we find it ?
because this isn ' t a dry wash . <continued_utterance> it ' s the little walking river . <continued_utterance> and it was full of water when i drove by here three days ago . full . i mean . a river .
yeah . not bad for a city college boy . bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps . i just got on the board of the zoological society , cost me a million ; that ' s the thing with wasps -- they like animals but they can ' t stand people !
uh , mr . <person> , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on tarafly . . about <number> thousand .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you . it doesn ' t add up . <person> ' s got ' em running scared . and i ' ll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .
y ' mean , i take it to the connection ?
yeah , whatever you want to call it .
sure . <person> growing up with a dad who sees every stage of growing up as a freudian passage . did you ever have crayons ?
sure .
no . no . we were just all outside just talking .
what were you talking about ?
<person> , i ' ll tell ya something . you can take that thing back to where you found it . and you can leave the coffee in the pot . i can pour that myself . i can wake myself up , too .
ok . hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway .
what time is it ?
eleven-thirty .
do you know what they ' re saying about you ?
no , but i ' m sure you ' ll tell me .
we ' re american soldiers . we don ' t abandon people .
funny you should say that while we ' re out looking for gold .
why you dogging me up ?
they came and found me . they said they ' d kill me unless i help them . plus they offer me a lot of money . no big deal . these things happen . <person> your gun on the floor . <continued_utterance> where do you want it ? the head to be quick ? or the chest for an open casket ?
i only called her ten minutes ago --
i made our reservation for <number> : <number> . we ' re going to be late .
wait a minute ! just hold on ! <person> , what was him ? what are you talking about ?
that man . <person> . he ' s home again ! he ' s got our children !
<person> .
<person> , ten dollars .
i ' m being sponsored by a sewage disposal system ?
we call it human resources management , <person> , please .
after they ' re printed .
i ' ll develop them myself -- give it to me or i ' ll start taping what you say in your sleep .
before you fall in love -- that ' s <person> . friend of wine , women , and somoza . they say he ' s a businessman .
he ' s a businessman in search of a business . he doesn ' t try very hard to cover up his connections to the
save the mom routine , will ya <person> . it doesn ' t work with me . one , two , three . <continued_utterance> look , it ' s not so bad we split up . it might be months before they find these guys . if at all . i mean with the mountain lions around here . remember , if they can ' t find no bodies , there ' s no crime . we ' ll be in phoenix by noon . lose this car , get another one . <person> , mexico are big countries , all that money <person> , you ' ll meet someone else , you know , there ' s a lot of hope with a $ <number> , <number> . they lift <person> again , and move to the edge .
<person> is a four-letter word .
she ' s a bird , <person> .
that ' s my fault , not hers . i ' ve got to keep practicing . i ' m still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and --
incidentally , how much will this cost ?
we are coming out - even .
well he ' s handsome and he ' s charming . he ' s all right . for now . <person> ' t say it , i know , i ' m <person> . i can ' t help it . i ' ve <person> to be good but it ' s too boring .
the way you talk . <person> heard a <person> talk like that .
<person> , belay that order ! <person> , where ' s that coming from !
just a second , mr . president .
oh , shit !
that ' s right , <person> . you better be afraid . i told you it wasn ' t over , but you didn ' t listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
are you out of your mind ? what on <person> ' d make us-
i ' ll pay you <number> each in advance and i ' ll mount you on those . <continued_utterance> got a sheaf of federal warrants . being in the territories it ' s up to our discretion how they ' re served . that means we got the cowboys without quarter . the black flag , brother . no prisoners , no mercy , amen .
delightful . we read , we knit sweaters , and we train our rats to perform circus tricks .
well , if ever you need any more rats , we can always send ours over . `cause we ' ve more than we need , strictly speaking . besides , they scare off all the pretty girls .
<person> . <person> . you asshole .
<person> who ? <person> , frustrated , clicks off .
<person> .
i ' d never be able to live with mysel --
<person> is a patient . he followed me here from new york which is bizarre . but even if it weren ' t bizarre , my daughter seeing a patient that i ' m treating is entirely inappropriate .
<person> said you ' re not treating him here .
<person> away .
it ' s not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i can ' t . i don ' t want to be alone . i need to know i ' m going to be taken care of .
she ' s married ?
last week . a small event , of course .
you mean <person> and <person> ?
dancing . <continued_utterance> if i had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked , i ' d be dead .
<person> don ' t eat each other .
i know .
i ' m fine , right . fit as a fucking fiddle .
<person> up , <person> .
we ' ll do our best . you ' re welcome to say goodbye .
he ' s a big boy .
trying to be .
<person> good for you . i bet it works out for you .
you ' re crossing the line , mr .
a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to principal dick <person>in ?
but you said she was a sparkplug . ?
i said buttplug . she ' s heinous .
i think i love you .
<person> ' t think so much .
<person> not the path of sodom ! for surely will the lord send his holy fire to destroy the city and all who dwell within , to smite them and all their seed for their iniquity .
when do you think all this smiting is going to go down ? we may have some friends there .
<person> , it ' s a bad state of affairs . let me ask you something , sir .
yes ?
there was just . some tension . you were upset . i remember being concerned .
at the party .
it wasn ' t cruel , it was desperate . c ' mon , <person> . you ' ve just got a bad case of first-time user anxiety .
i don ' t like it here . i don ' t know what ' s going on . we ' re blundering around together in this unformed world , whose rules and objectives are largely unknown , seemingly indecipherable , or even possibly non-existent , always on the verge of being killed by forces we don ' t understand .
oh .
unless you need me to come home .
we ' re supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats , now they ' re telling me that there was a mistake and we can ' t have padded .
what kind of seats can we have ?
oh , <person> , can ' t we leave here ? i hate it so much . you don ' t like it either -- all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day . <person> ' s just leave and start over someplace else .
' start over . ' do you know how many times i ' ve started over , sweetheart ? i don ' t want to do it anymore . this is as far as i want to go . this place . i have to make this work somehow . we do . you ' re fourteen now -- you have to help me .
exactly . what i can do is this . <continued_utterance> get on your bus and go back to new york . every time a problem comes up , follow this prescription .
i don ' t need pills . i have plenty of pills .
what ?
why don ' t you tell her ? how you sent the destroyer to kill our friends ? to kill me ?
a <person> ? noooo .
<person> , a <person> . it was the guy who killed <person> ' s mother .
no . what happened ?
she won ' t speak to me . <continued_utterance> . she won ' t let me apologize .
. i ' m sure it is , but this is massachusetts , <person> . certified in internal medicine ?
no .
god , sailor . thats the night my daddy died .
i know , sugar . but while the place was burnin . <person> came out - i pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin . afterwards . when i met you , i always liked to think i mighta saved your life .
she ' s making this up .
i ' m not . <person> ' t pick up my cello for weeks .
ted and <person> lean against the wall .
i genuinely think she wants me . i feel a vibe .

when <person> was dumped out there in the badlands , he was dropped on his back . our man made an effort to turn him over , onto his face . it ' s an old ind ' n belief that if a dead man is turned face down , his spirit won ' t leave . and in the killer ' s case , it won ' t come back and jump all over his shit . that ' s an ind ' n thing a white man wouldn ' t know . <continued_utterance> and that ' s the way it is . write it down . <continued_utterance> you laugh all you want , <person> . <person> tonight , i get my man .

scalp wounds bleed a lot . head wounds in general . that ' s why , if you ' re ever in a bar fight , the thing to do is pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose . it ' ll make his eyes fill with blood and snot , and buy you enough time to run away .

i just think about things as they come up . i never been much of a planner .
i told you what i ' m seein ' <person> about . that ' s all .
<person> , business . <person> to be rid of you . you ' re not in the girly mood .
hey , don ' t back away from it , you were right . we did look stupid . what you were wrong about , is who made us look that way . <continued_utterance> think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . <person> had an affair with <person> , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for <person> to fabricate her charge in the first place .
maybe <person> ' s attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
i can ' t breathe , i can ' t breathe .
<person> , look at me , look in my eyes ! you ' re alright . everything will be alright . trust me .
i don ' t think we ' ve got to take drastic action . <continued_utterance> thought i ' d come by and get things off my chest . talk it out . <person> , i ' m going over to pimlico . catch the seventh race . wan na come ?

not unless you have a welding rig in all that shit of yours . and even if you did , it wouldn ' t matter .
but we still have the battery , right ?
we ' re aware of the situation , mr . <person> . but we take a long view of these things . fortunately you are unhurt .
then i ' ll go to the press . i ' ll tell the entire story to the new york times .
my father was in the army .
i know . unfortunately he didn ' t fight in vietnam either .
i don ' t know why the floor was wet !
why ? !
well , if <person> ' s going , i ' m going , too . i ' m volunteering .
i see . what ' s your name , lad ?
if you tell me the truth about the war , i will tell you the truth about the big horses i ' ve been keeping in the windmill .
now - who is the one telling lies !
of course , i ' m sure . ah , <person> , the puberty police are back .
i ' ll deal with this . you dig up <person> .
you ever look down on them again and call them `` grocers '' like it ' s a dirty word , and you ' ll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks . got it ?
<person> and clear . <continued_utterance> that ' s probably my office .
give me a goddam break . i ' m not going to go anywhere alone .
and i ' m going to make sure of it . give me your wrist .
<person> , i got ta take a piss bad . can i use your head there ?
well . <person> - okay .

they ' re just lonely is all . <person> , i howl myself sometimes .
you get lonely ?
not since they begun reconstruction . what ' re you doing with that ?
i ' m going to visit a site .
i know about your condition , ida . it ' s not your fault . there are a lot of women that can ' t carry a baby full term . i know how much you ' re hurting .
you don ' t know anything about me or what i ' ve gone through .
it ' s murder , and i won ' t be any part of it .
then step aside .
<person> ' t make me angry , <person> .
you be careful . i ' m a powerful sorcerer . i could turn you into a toad just like that .
i guess you must be , if you know the
right . <continued_utterance> we , better skedaddle . close that closet -- <person> ? you ail right ?
that ' s because i ' m really an arms dealer .
i ' ve never known an arms dealer .
i ' ll be a dishwasher , i ' ll live in a flophouse .
what the hell happened ?
no . <person> .
you mean those animals run machines ?
well , well , when can we meet again .
<person> . i ' ll meet you here . tuesday night . i got ta go . you going my way ?
no , my dear , he is a federal agent . he killed two of my colleagues the other night .
no , you don ' t understand , we ' ve been married for <number> years --
really , what a coincidence . am i disturbing you ?
only in a good way . <person> down . <continued_utterance> it must be nice having an analyst in the family .
<person> , i won ' t even make the cut !
what happened to your confidence ?
you saw him ?
we talked . he wanted to get a bite -- after . i said no .
she ' s sleeping in .
no doubt . i don ' t think anyone got a wink last night with all that racket . <continued_utterance> i thought there were laws in this city against illicit cohabitation . or are they just another big policeman ' s joke ?
<person> -- lapd . we bullet- proofed him in exchange for <number> % of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in darktown and <person> la-
-black and mexican-
i think you know . the timetable has been set . it will happen on a holiday , when people are away from their homes . when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country . the president will declare a state of emergency , at which time all federal agencies , all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency . fema , <person> . the secret government .
and they tell me i ' m paranoid .
yes ?
<person> , listen to me . where did you get this candy ?
you don ' t play games with homicide police . there are no options here . there is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle .
i ' ve known him for while maybe twenty years kind of a close friend but hey what the heck officer , take him away , go on it ' s for his own good .
it ' s a hit .
how ' s the children ' s book department ?
you think we should be more open minded ?
the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in africa and asia . imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine .
. put the rest of it in a money market account for now . i want to see what you know before i invest it . and save the cheap salesman talk , it ' s obvious .
excuse me sir .
my brother and i used to climb to the top of this old beech tree in the back yard and watch the moon come up just like this . my parents would fight all the time so we ' d sneak out there where we couldn ' t hear ' em and recite scenes from our favorite movies . <continued_utterance> would you believe i miss it ? the middle of paradise and i ' m homesick .
well , i wouldn ' t worry . it ' ll all be there when we get back .
where is it ?
on a bench , across the street . <continued_utterance> you calling me a liar ?
<person> is a wonderful catch for a girl like her .
she ' s married ?
iandiacute ; m not interested in the whole world , <person> . iandiacute ; m interested in america . let the rest of the world deal with mutants their own way .
where to ?
yes . i said stop . i screamed . i mean that ' s how it sounded in my head . he hurt me .
that ' s okay , <person> . you ' re doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
<person> ' s signature will be on the treaty by morning .
the king ' s birthday celebration . ?
nothing that concerns you spacemen .
i ' d better take a look anyway . <continued_utterance> why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device ?
we ' re giving the brits polaris instead . but a story ' ll just aggravate things . <continued_utterance> not today . he ' s got tight schedule .
pretending there isn ' t a problem won ' t fix it . he can clear the air on <person> relations .
some limey . he ' s a middle-man for somebody . he doesn ' t say and i don ' t ask .
we want to meet him .
oh , goodness ! did any of them sting you ?
i - i guess they tried to , but they bent their stingers .
will you stop eating the eggs for a minute ! how can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs ? ! what does this mean , <person> ?
well , i ' m supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement , but i ' m not that honorable a guy . <continued_utterance> i got ta go .
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr . <person> . that ' s nothing new .
not in . <continued_utterance> this doll is cocaine . <continued_utterance> every part , from his ears to his accessory belt , is high-impact , pressure-molded cocaine . odorless . undetectable by dogs . undetectable by anyone .
i believe you . <person> ' t you afraid ?
musketeers are not afraid of anything .
here -- here . go ' way and let us alone !
oh , scared , huh ? <continued_utterance> how long can you stay fresh in that can ? come on -- get up and fight , you shivering junk yard ! put your hands up , you lop-sided bag of hay ! cs -- <person> reacts -- speaks --
the number you asked for .
i ask for a lot of ' em . <person> is it ?
for what ?
well , i counseled you , you did exactly what i said , and i just . poured cold water over your effort . i didn ' t get it . i ' m a terrible shrink , probably . i should ' ve never got out of real estate -- actually i should never have left <person> for that cowboy in armarillo -- have you ever been to amarillo ?
did she ever mention any friends ?
no . <person> over there .
oh no ? i ain ' t seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the blue monster . <continued_utterance> an old flame ?
kind of . <person> -- one of the sweetest guys in the world . <person> up the volume .
i ' m a teacher . high school math . and you ? what do you do ?
this is what i do , frank .
my dad .
it works ?
i hated it .
that ' s not exactly what i meant by constructive , <person> .
your men ! all my life `` your men '' have been able to count on you ? why is it that you ' ve never been there for me ? <continued_utterance> and what if you ' re wrong ? what if one day , the sun didn ' t rise in the east and birds didn ' t fly south in winter and for once in your life your compass was off ? huh ? <continued_utterance> would you be willing to wreck your men ' s future ? my future ? please . dad . think . be practical , for a change . i ' m asking you , i ' m fucking begging you .
i don ' t sleep with no whore and i don ' t wake up with no whore . that ' s how i live with myself , <person> . i don ' t know how you do . i hope i ' m wrong , i ' ll let them decide for themselves , that much i promise you .
remember : be home by seven .
<person> !
the man ' s life has been destroyed . there will always be doubters , no matter what happened in court .
i ' m not paying any idiot twenty million dollars .
<person> . <person> ' s gon na wire me some money , and then .
you talked to him ? ! is he mad ? did you tell him ?
i beg your pardon . is that a proverb ?
no , it ' s a prophecy . the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time . the only difference between the pyramids and the empire state building is that the egyptians didn ' t have unions . i know what this guy is about -- greed -- he ' s in and out for the buck and he don ' t take prisoners . he don ' t give a damn about northstar or us .
i have answers for you .
is she alive ?
what brings you here ?
i ' d like to tell you . but i can ' t .
<person> ' t have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
you ' re lucky you didn ' t break down in the desert . day like today , you ' d be dead in no time . when you leaving ?
our world .
with chrome . any everything will proceed cyclically .
or hemingway , when <person> lost all those stories .
he was never able to reproduce them .
<person> ?
within a year you ' re gon na be one of the `` ten most admired men in america . ``
this is where it started .
where
so what do we do ?
you go down there .
why ?
probably because it sounds scary .
what is he being charged with ?
i don ' t know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened .
<person> , i ' ve been all over the place .
well , it ' s good to have you back here , i ' ll tell you that .
where is she , <person> ?
you want to kill me , <person> ? go ahead .
i love <person> . <person> ' s amazing . <person> makes coffee nervous . are we still on schedule ?
we open two weeks before thanksgiving .
you need a ride uptown ?
i could use one .
yes .
that ' s like twenty minutes from school !
all the equipment is brand new .
no irrigation system . somebody ' s covering their tracks . <continued_utterance> hey !
he ' s here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department , so <person> introduces us .
wow .
why ?
to begin with , she ' s only sixteen years-old .
she ' s an officer in the <person> army -- we saw her in matagalpa .
you mean i slept with a sandinista ? <continued_utterance> i guess <person> is alive , eh ?
good . she ' s good . i have to deliver this . i have a very thirsty date . she ' s part camel .
<person> . it ' s <person> , isn ' t it ?
so , how did your conference go with <person> ?
the conference , oh yeah . <person> . we reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us .
all right , but this stinks .
<person> , you don ' t know it yet , but me and concrete are in your blood . we ' re going to make a man of you yet -- and in years to come you ' ll thank me . you ' ll remember me . me and concrete .
i don ' t want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you ?
maybe i ' ve been mistaken for somebody else . <continued_utterance> a guy with the same name as me in time magazine . it ain ' t a common name so i looked out for it . but the day it came out , every newstand was sold out . no library had it . i even wrote off for a back-issue . never seen a copy to this day . <continued_utterance> maybe i ' m being set up for something . you ever feel like that , <person> ? like your whole life has been building to something ?
what is it ?
look for yourself .
because that ' s my family .
and who are you exactly ?
you ' re the craziest human being on the face of this earth !
what else do you want from me ? huh ? what else ? ! i ' ve got enough problems with the i . r . s . busting my balls and the home improvement commission bullshit to contend with . i don ' t need aggravation from you .
you didn ' t hear something ?
yeah , i heard a key slapping against my ass .
when this is over , will you get this goddam thing out of my head ?
on my life , i promise you i will .
then get out and close it behind you .
you know what you need , buddy buddy -- an optorectomy . that ' s when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum -- to change that shitty attitude of yours .
why not ?
well --
you suggesting i err on the side of excess ?
you always go out to shoot zero . sometimes you pull it off . but you can ' t play like that at the open . you win by taking what the course gives you . you win by being humble , which you aren ' t , and patient , which you never will
what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year ?
no . <continued_utterance> how much did you put on there ? <continued_utterance> you put too much . that ' s two hundred and fifty pounds .
there ' s a lot more where this came from .
you know what i think you should do now . why don ' t you pull some files . some files that were completed , others that went unsold , and i ' ll have somebody run it down , talk to the customers and get some statements .
<person> ! but i should tell you , this isn ' t really my area . i ' m just on a break from the mud department --
one more word and you die --
i ' m sorry , <person> , we ' re not allowed .
. would you , would you call him up . i ' ll give you my number , and ask him .
i don ' t know . if this one ' s any faster than that other one .
i think we wait right here .
i know how hard it can be sometimes .
uh-huh . what can be ?
all she knows is she likes the three dog ' cause his name is pride of odessa ' cause she ' s from odessa .
<person> ready for oddessa-lation , boys .
oh , gee thanks . <person> , let me see --
yes or no .

president of the <person> . <continued_utterance> he ' s a boxer . a flyweight .
huh uh . a jockey . his name ' s , um , <person> . . <person> hardapple .
oh , no .
he gave you an infected bioport so that my pod would die and so would my game-system .
i think what he ' s trying to say -- what we ' re trying to say -- is that things aren ' t exactly what they seem to be .
well , they don ' t `` seem '' to be that great so i can ' t wait for this one . hey , here we are ! two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame . bullets flying !
well i ought to know my own mind and i ' m tellin ' you what suits me is a family and kids . that suits me right down to the ground . in fact , that ' s my idea of heaven . all right , what ' s your idea of heaven ?
room service . <continued_utterance> see ? you ' re laughing again . but that ' s what i want . go places and <person> and never look back and just <person> fun . forever . that ' s my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .
i apologize for interrupting the festivities , but i have some good news . i ' ve been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools . and it seems quite clear . `` minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians . `` <continued_utterance> so long , ladies . prom ' s over .
honestly , <person> . it ' s like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .
i ' ve only been in love once .
apparently , you kept repeating it last night . you did sleep , <person> , and your advisor said you cried out , you had a nightmare .
it was .
what about <person> ?
i ' m just getting used to ya , <person> .
<person> ' s face it , we ' re not exactly setting the world on fire .
<person> , <person> . we ' re handymen .
whatever the hell we are , we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment .
but we were contacted there by <person> . he seemed to know exactly who we were .
that ' s because <person> tipped him off that you were coming . <person> was a mole for cortical systematics .
yes i do ! aw <person> wait ! <person> ' t be sore ! i was having a little fun !
fun ! i could have lost my arm !
depends who it ' s from .
your friends at warren , <person> and <person> .
what ' re you talking about ? why would i want to break your windows ?
you didn ' t smash my windows in ?
<person> ' s got a boil on his ass ? <continued_utterance> i don ' t know . <continued_utterance> thanks , man . appreciate it .
yeah . you figure out how to win the war be sure to let us know .

yeah . i just got some business downtown i got ta take care of .
<person> will be ready in a second . <person> ' s on the table .

i didn't see nothin .
yeah . but i did . and i told you all about it .
<person> , that ' s ok but <person> but you have to promise me .
<person> ' t worry , <person> . i ' ll go .
maybe it ' s a slump , but like baseball , some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again .
you ' re not serious about this , are you , <person> ?
must have been quite the spat .
i told you , i don ' t know him . i just want to make sure he ' s okay .
but if you could , you would ?
yes .
<person> .
you said , `` <person> '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?
what ?
well , i robbed a gas station once , and i robbed a couple of liquor stores , and some convenience stores . and that ' s it .
it ' s not like i didn ' t have ideas , i had plenty of ideas . but i never even shared them with your father .
what kind of ideas ?
your majesty , if you were king you wouldn ' t be afraid of anything ?
not nobody , not nohow !
shoot him .
shoot him ? like with a gun ?
i really do have to go .
you don ' t want to be late . she ' s in agony . he turns and walks away .
we ! . so you two are a couple ?
no ! i just don ' t think you ' re safe to be around a woman right now .
oh , leland , sit down and eat you dinner .
oh , i ' ll sit down , but none of us are going to start eating till <person> goes and washes her hands .
why ?
some say it ' s because that ' s the best way to play through the winds of west texas . and some say it ' s because i never finish anything . you can decide . the point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist , the warrior athlete who,
get off him . <continued_utterance> you two fighting ' s not going to get us anything .
him getting us stranded out here doesn ' t do much good either .
for <person> . for <person> !
americans ? journalists ?

<person> , officer .
i ' m not gon na fight you , there ' s no money in it . sober up . come on , boys .
wretched slugs , don ' t any of you <person> the guts to play for blood ?
but then you knew what he was like all along . maybe his killing <person> was a thing you had counted on .
but then it is better this way , don ' t you think ? no loose ends . <continued_utterance> what ?
how would you like it if i did that to your mother ' s panties ?
i ' d call you a sick , twisted fuck . but this is different . she wasn ' t your mother mother --

<person> that ' s a hell of a how-do-you- do .
drop your gear , go below and pick yourself some bunks .

please don ' t go till you know where you ' re going . please . !
i do know where i ' m going . i ' m going to <person> and i ' m gon na try to see that girl . and then depending on what happens there , i thought i ' d try to see if there ' s any work for me out west . and if there is , i ' m gon na head out there for the summer and try to make some money . and if there isn ' t , i ' ll figure something else out . maybe i ' ll stay around the east . i don ' t know . i really liked it in <person> . it was really beautiful . you just -- it made me feel good . and before things got so messed up i was doin ' pretty well out there . seriously . but i couldn ' t stay here long , <person> : i don ' t want to live here . but i ' m gon na stay in touch . and i ' ll be back . ' <person> i want to see you and i want to see <person> . i ' ll come home for <person> . how about that ? we ' ll have <person> together . come on , <person> . you can trust me . <continued_utterance> come on , <person> . <person> at me . <person> at me . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> . remember when we were kids , remember what we always used to say to each other . . . ? remember when we were kids ?

there was a crash last year . they just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit . even the plaintiffs don ' t know .
how do you know ?
and why would that scare me ?
because then you couldn ' t hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god . <continued_utterance> but the real reason you ' re scared ? you like me ! <continued_utterance> if you were really my friends , you ' d be helping me , not running me down .
you upset with me ?
no , sailor darlin . just shockin sometimes when things arent the way you thought they were . i been carryin a secret too .
i dunno . i thought i ' d better call , that ' s all .
well , i ' m glad you did .
and you think it helps calling her rogue ?
weandiacute ; ve learned to embrace what we are rather than hide it like an affliction . for some , it has become their identity . you mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride . they arrive at the door to the gym .
you never walked away dad . you could have walked away .
i ' m just so scared of that song . that fucking , `` my son just arrived the other day . he says thanks for the ball , come on let ' s play . i got lots of bills come again next day . he ' s grown up just like me . my boy is just like me . `` <person> fucking <person> , <person> , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .

the stuff we got last night .
i ' ll do it . i want to be . better .
that ' s what i like to hear . <person> , you guys get these dishes cleaned up . <person> ' s show <person> how we do it in concrete .

yes --
i ' m sorry .

i hear these stories . your husband in jail . his business in chaos . various people fighting over the scraps .
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization , not ours .
<person> -- so you ' re doctor <person> of ' <person> , <person> . ' so ?
as i said . this is going to be very difficult -- for both of us .
have they all been accounted for ?
all but . three . on <person> ' s face , a flicker of irritation .
he likes them with the unbridled enthusiasm of a seventeen-year-old virgin who ' s been making mental beef jerky since he saw the bevy of tender young skirt steaks at his new hacienda .
that ' s my boy !
there ' s <person> . <person> kid .

you ' re certain you were in the passenger car ?

what ' s it doing ?
why do you all keep asking me ?
we do .
do you both realize that neither of you can be buried on hallowed ground because of these . these mutilations ? does your bioport manual tell you that ?
yes . yes . it was your parents who were brave . i make jams .
and you ' ve never done a brave thing in your life ?
<person> ! <person> ! you were right ! this whole tree is made of gold ! !
fools ! you should never have come to this place ! we ' re all going to die ! <continued_utterance> we ' ve got to get off this island right now . <person> ! the boat ! it ' s our only chance !
i asked <person> about it . he didn ' t own up to it . he said he didn ' t know what got into <person> .
he ' s just raffish . <person> put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on <person> <number> , that old fox .
how do i know ? you take it where they told you to take it .
y ' mean , i take it to the connection ?
. i understand .
my doctor told me that i got to move out west . that ' s when we filed in court . we didn ' t want to sue .
well , i don ' t give a damn anyway , i have <number> drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and i got ta work all night anyway . so it was all for the best . but you better not leave that <person> ' s phone number lying around because when i ' m done .
<person> ' t worry , i ' ll leave you her phone number on the hall table . if she ' s really terrific i ' ll put a big ' x ' next to it . ' bye , guys -- love ya . i won ' t wake you tomorrow morning . see you in three weeks .

uh-huh . what can be ?
well , i don ' t think i ' ve seen you since the reception at dean ackerman ' s last year . <continued_utterance> for the dupont chair . i swear . i ' m becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst .
was this all about the oil ?
it is my oil ! <person> and my family ' s ! <continued_utterance> it runs in my veins , thicker than blood . i ' m going to redraw the map . and when i am through the whole world will know my name , my grandfather ' s name , the glory of my people .
i think you oughta read it to her .
<person> idea . <continued_utterance> dear jessy . how do i love thee ? let me count the . i , <person> <person> , of sound mind and body . hey ?
i was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .
excuse me ?
this <number> maroon ford <person> <number> . you driving this car ?
if i really knew you , i know what i would find -- instead of a brain , a cash register , instead of a heart , a bottom line . <person> is shocked at herself .
what is it ?
weandiacute ; ve learned to embrace what we are rather than hide it like an affliction . for some , it has become their identity . you mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride . they arrive at the door to the gym .
inspiring -- now what am i doing here ?
someone ran us off the road .
there ' s no parking here .
-junior ' s left the fucking planet .
you find him ?
<person> , <person> always swore you were working , but --
but . . . ?
how did i get into this cab ?
you stepped into it in the normal manner , sir or madam .
i ' m gon na be en route with a team shortly to relieve you . just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives . and x ? you done yourself proud helping those people today . xander tussles the hair of the captain ' s <person> .
thanks .
<person> said you ' re not treating him here .
he ' s right there !
if i could accept the offer right now , i would . they took it back .
i understand . i went to the bar association . they tell me you ' re going to be disbarred .
<person> . <person> to look for the highest vantage point . from what i can figure , heandiacute ; ll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that <person> has to --
<person> . <person> looks at her . storm weandiacute ; ll be fine .
she ain ' t in on it .
i have dreams about this , actual dreams about busting the top people , the rich people , the white people .
tell me . bring it on .
it ' s sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection . it ' s a facial prosthetic . it was two weeks in the making .
we have much in common . we both attended school in the united states , and both of our fathers are engineers .
i got into stereo equipment when i was a kid . some people don ' t notice the difference but it is very important to me .
this body is in your possession ?
and it ' s what you need to burn <person> to the ground . but if those files and his body were to be given to <person> and the feds , with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop . well . the word `cataclysmic ' comes to mind .
<person> , we bein strangers here and all , this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin .
you think shes pretty ?
it ' s a map , i think that ' s what it is .
there you go , <person> . just find the buried treasure , and you ' re a millionaire .
no , i was going to sacrifice him .
not to him , i ' m guessing .
what the hell are you doing ?
well , you treat me like <person> , i ' ll act like her . i ' ll be working for <person> ' s campaign .
trust me on it .
i do trust you , <person> . like i aint never trusted nobody before .
<person> .
he didn ' t do anything . he just told me his theory . it ' s sad when patients get like that . they loose reality . david <person> what the hell are you doing ?
that ' s rarely been a problem .
well , i should recommend you go work on your short game but i think it ' s better if you go get drunk instead .
that ' s okay . you don ' t have to .
actually , it ' s not that i don ' t want to go . it ' s just that i ' ve never been on a boat and i ' m not sure i can handle it .
what does it mean ?
usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself , probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of grass and hay .
really .
we only know each other -- oh god , you ' re not going to believe this --
take your time . do it right .
<person> ' t worry .
<person> ' t even think about it , cowboy !
oh , yeah , tough guy ? !
the kuala lumpur ferry was <number> miles off-course that night . <person> blamed the auto-pilot ; i suspected he was drunk - until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem .
did you test the auto-pilots ? the satellite positioning receiver ?
no problem .
up the stairs !
so , what brings you here at his hour ?
my new bike .
<person> ' a . winchester . <number> . <person> .
<person> , you are so full of shit .

i couldn ' t believe the things i was doing . it was like an internal struggle going on inside my body .
he was so pissed .
i came in from my room .
are you kidding ? it would kill them to know that i even get hard-ons .
still , you might want to get it fixed before asking <person> out .
a couple years ago .
why ' d you stop ?
excuse me , did you say there was a satellite crash ?
yep . they said it was radioactive . <continued_utterance> i ' m probably sterile now .
my friend , if you ' re planning on crossing me .
i know , poison needles in my shins . you ' ve got <number> hours . <person> , out .
hey , hey , hey , i ' m not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that ' s crossing the line !
what line ? the day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war !
understand what ?
the sun came up today .
what does he look like ?
there ' s a waiter blocking , i can ' t see her face . he ' s serving her a cup of tea and she ' s putting in three spoonfuls of sugar --
<person> , i ' ve got news for you . i got through to a friend ' s voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious . i ' m sure she ' s called the cops by now .
would you listen to yourself ? what kind of psycho do you think i am ?
claire .
she never mentioned you . <continued_utterance> then again , she didn ' t say much about her college friends . she gives claire the once over . <continued_utterance> i ' m watchin ' my shows .
you ' re too late , <person> . we ' re going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind .
what the hell are you talking about ?
give me the seven iron . i ' m laying up .
you can make that shot .
the job ' s gon na cost you a hundred bucks .
a hundred bucks ? that ' s ridiculous .
i guess there ' s probably a story behind that .
there is , but it ' s not that interesting .
i ' m not so sure i do .
getting a bioport fitted . i dunno . i can ' t do it . it ' s too freaky . <person> my skin crawl .
new mistress . so ? go !

<person> , what i just tell you ?
<person> , hold on , <person> -- it ' s not as bad as it sounds . i certainly didn ' t know --
that you put a murderer on my trail ?
i guess so .
well , he doesn ' t live very far from here .
you ' re gon na get through it , but the first thing we do is get <person> to represent <person> . we get <person> and we beat this thing .
how much do i pay him ?
so you fucked a student ? !
that ' s not what i ' m sayi --
i don ' t believe a word you ' re saying .
i was afraid you ' d think that . i ' m sorry to have to do this , but you really are stuck . <person> , would you come in now please ?
why don ' t you read it ?
<person> ' t like telegrams . all them stops and stuff .
my <person> -- she ' s not in japan , she ' s single , and she ' s got no rugrats . she does have a little gambling problem , she plays the football cards a bit too much , but she ' s a babe , a surgeon babe !

<person> , i have not yet begun to defile myself .
but <person>-
<person> . she goes back to the magazine .
how long are you staying in philly ?
august !

and the bullet ricocheted off the film , grazed your cheek , and saved your life .

i ' m going to show you how to wash this tile and then you ' re going to do it .
come off it , <person> . i ' m late for work .

i ' ve all these men to take care of , corporal , you can see that , can ' t you ?
<person> , sir , this horse can pull through anything .

he came to see me .
<person> ' t you hear <person> ? what if he dies ? then the sheriff will come . they ' ll say we broke their laws
we ' ll pray that he doesn ' t die ! but if he does , then we ' ll find a way so no one knows !
you disappoint me , <person> . always figured you to be a man ; a real bright guy . i had respect for you .
that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert .
that ' s not a bear . that ' s just some lines on a skin .
it ' s not a real bear . it ' s a `` representation '' of a bear . you know , a `` picture . ``
why not ?
he was your contact at the trout farm . a damn good man . his dog brought me this .
<person> .
and every day we finished at three in the morning and since <person> always gets up around <number> : <number> .
i started dinner . the potatoes are frying , and i ' m heating up the hot dogs .
hold your mother ' s hand .

how do you kill it ?
<person> ' t look so shocked , it ' s been a long time . i bet you ' ve changed a lot over the last twelve years , haven ' t you ?
it ' s just that . <person> . i wouldn ' t have thought .
i don ' t want <person> , i need <person> ! <continued_utterance> look , there seems to be some confusion . you see , dr . <person> , uh , <person> , wanted me to call him but i lost his number .

all in all i guess it ' ll all work out for the best .
i ' m glad you feel that way .
nothing .
how good ' s your intelligence ?
<person> , it wasn ' t a prank . i know that voice .
he disguised it though , didn ' t he ? same as before ?
what ' s that ?

i ' m not going to keep calling you <person> <person> .
the name is <person> .
that ' s okay . thanks .
you know <person> ' s doing really well with wrestling here , <person> . the regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states .
you ' re taking it to the next level . i always do that . i always take a relationship to the next level , and if it works okay i take it to the next level after that , until i can finally get to the level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave .
i ' m not going to stay long anyway . i already said that , didn ' t i . <person> . i ' m a total wreck . <continued_utterance> <person> , this woman is the most adorable creature i have ever come in contact with . if she turns out to be even as good-looking as a mailbox , i will be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her .
the high aldwin ? ? why ?
sir ! i have to talk to you .
i suggested we go to the police , but you didn ' t like that ; so , frankly , <person> , i ' m all out of ideas .
well , what ' s the big rush , thelma ? if we just give ' em some time , they ' ll come to us . ! oh christ . i ' m just not ready to go to jail yet . why don ' t you go out to the pool or something and i ' ll figure it out .
<person> good . so you ' re human .
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
<person> , what the hell am i doing ?

that ' s a big deal , <person> . were you even gon na tell me ?

winners don ' t do coke . or haven ' t you been reading the bumper stickers ?
what do we have here ?
no , i just meant .
yeah yeah . i ' m going to the corner to get a cup of coffee .
chancellor . <person> ' t you look ravishing .
<person> ' t you sweet to say so . i was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to -- oh !
i can understand if you ' re thinkin ' about it . i mean , in a way , you ' ve got something to go back for . i mean <person> and everything .
thelma , that is not an option .

you couldn ' t wait until morning ? <continued_utterance> what happened ?
huh ? if . if we . we ' re not ?
if we ' re not , then you just killed someone real . a real person .
you know i am .
this isn ' t a game , <person> !
no . i ' d hit it again because that shot was a defining moment . and when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you . i did not shrink from the challenge . i rose to it .
<number> , fort washington golf club , fresno , california , final round of the tour qualifying school .
not a clue . i didn ' t lose the ship . <person> , your new personal communicator . picture-phone , fax , beeper .
do i have to dial ' <number> ' to get out ?
whether you thought this was for real or not , you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct . that tells me something about your character .
<person> for you . now why don ' t you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn ' t go through all this for my benefit .
yes .
but no book . let me see , let me see . wait a minute . there ' s a book with a flower , so it must be her .
yes .
have you ever tried to develop it ?
i think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis .
maybe we should compare .
<person> , i know you don ' t like flattery but if anybody i know is going to win a nobel prize , it ' s you . you got ta be thinking about your next book so i know you ' ll find this case particularly interesting .
what sort of case is it , <person> ?
i ' d stake my life on it , <person> .
<person> assured , captain . you have .
<person> , honey . <person>s just actin strange .
you aint actin , mama .
`` you know . ``

he will need his friends now more than ever .
i will always be at his side .
why do you twist my words ?
you could have told me what i was from the beginning . why didn ' t you ?
i think i forgot the tent .
you forgot the tent ?
<person> ?
vain . proud . such a person is <person>snarr . he is not plain .
what a lovely hat , mrs . <person> . it goes quite well with your head .
<person> ! oh , <person> !

no , hey , i already told this whole damn thing to sheriff `` not-quite-able '' . here ' s the trailer now . he swings open the door . carl and this is exactly the way she left it . i never touched a god damn thing .
i think you ' d discover a lot of things if you really knew me .
if i really knew you , i know what i would find -- instead of a brain , a cash register , instead of a heart , a bottom line . <person> is shocked at herself .
why , sure you can , <person> . you can get me out of here and then i ' ll get that rocket off you , and we ' ll make a break for <person> ' s house .
<person> ' s house . <person> ' s house . what ' s the difference .
<person> . it ' s just , things are a bit hot for me right now . if i get a signal . i may have to leave suddenly .
i understand .
no .
of what ? what were you so afraid of ?
there it is ! hold it steady !
<person> !
that sounds like fun .
<person> , it ' s fun for them , but it ' s heaven for me . those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world . <person> , hey , i got ta run .
i wanted to think he ' d changed .
no you didn ' t . but he did change . just not enough .
<person> . i ' m sorry .

i ' ll fuck your father in the shower .
we administer the halothane .
<person> ?
not much . it ' s hard to talk .
uh , <person> , do me a favor . could you sit in the back so you won ' t cause as much of a commotion .
no specifics , remember ?
minus specifics , it ' s hard to help .
why you got to move away to talk ! ?
we ' re going to be right over here .
heat , i think . the coincident invasion of a host , the fireman , and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six .
this man ' s still alive .
so i ' m told . <continued_utterance> go ahead .
really ?
<person> ?
after graduation . maybe we could go away together ?
like a grateful dead concert .
<person> begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . <person> is completely overwhelmed .
the name of the song . `` i ' m <person> ' that i love you . ``
-- '' <person> ' that i love you . ``

i don ' t think so .
there ' s nothing on the other side of the mountains . everybody knows that . the world just ends . you ' d fall right off the edge .
but what if it doesn ' t ? what if it just goes on and on forever ? or what if it ' s round ?

it ' s hell here tonight . everyone and their uncle is at the mall .
but what if he comes back . ?
we just have to stay in the car until morning . then we ' ll be safe . that can ' t be more than , like , a few more hours . <person> ' s bound to come along once the sun comes up . <person> human i mean . think you can hold on until then ?
and then what ?
and then shoot them .
<person> . i know what you meant .
i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them .
how ' d it work out with our moth girl ? did she turn into a butterfly for you ?
yes she did .
come on . you ' re going to get us in trouble .
it was an accident . you saw it was an accident .

what if it starts up again while <person> ' s on the way ?
he can borrow my slicker .
now , as for the nipples , you ' ve got to be very , very , very careful . <continued_utterance> as soon as the hole gets too big she ' s got ta throw them out -- this is extra , extra , extra-specially important -- ' cause if the hole ' s too big , the milk comes out too fast and it ' s bad for her digest .
i got ta get going , i ' ll miss my plane .
we ' re gon na tell you how it ends , baby .
<person> ' t you wan na know how it ends ?
<person> , i ' ll call <person> in the psych department , see what i can find out .
promise ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll make you some coffee .
you are my son .
am i ?
that ' s not your line .
say you love me .
get up off your ass and dig !
what ' s the point ? there ' s nothing here . the map ' s a fake . <person> , even i see that now . we ' re just wasting our time . we might as well give up and --
<person> !
who ' s he barking at now ?
no .
<person> ?
is that where you caught today ' s special ?
the restaurant is controlled by us . we raise these mutant creatures as food and that is our cover , but of course , we are also raising them as components for undetectable and hypoallergenic weapons . <person> under the noses of our enemies . and speaking of our enemies , it ' s important that you go back to work at cortical systematics . we need to maintain as many agents there as we can . i ' ll take care of the mess at the restaurant .
you ' re telling me <person> thinks <person> was killed . i don ' t have to ask you who he thinks did it , do i ? all i ' m saying is , read that , you ' ll have a new perspective on things .
why didn ' t you tell us about this before the trial ? <person> holds her eyes .
<person> .
say it .
<person> , do think there ' s a difference between a reason and an excuse , because i don ' t think there is .
<person> --
. now , let me get this straight . two years you give me problems with your fuckin ' payoffs . now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .
go ?
go .
what is this shit you ' re giving me ?
this is not -- shit , mr . <person> . it ' s the truth . i know it ' s very hard for you to accept , but you ' re having a schizophrenic reaction . we can ' t snap you out of the narkadine . you ' re in a world of your own fantasy .
he saw her at the northern care .
. and i have inquiries out to doctors , experts in the field . there is , of course , a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor ' s negligent .
like i ' m going to try to figure out a guy who ' s idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick ' s face
you were following us ?
i mean it , now .
i said ' <person> , ' didn ' t i ?
i ' m not pissing and moaning .

i don ' t need one . i don ' t expect to win .
what ' re you talking about ? today i happened to have eggs and flapjacks , some cantalope , some juice and then another juice .

<person> , <person> . <person> let me . i can do it .

like you ' d know .
i do know . be two places at once . learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel . eat breakfast with chopsticks .
why are they beating him ?
he hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed . <person> was the train was over a trestle instead of land . nobody comes back from that .
and steal <person> ' s fishin ' stuff .
i don ' t know how to fish , <person> .

she never mentioned her father .
you know your trouble , <person> ? you ' re not romantic . <continued_utterance> everything ' s so wonderful here , so pretty , so exciting , i can ' t understand how you stay frozen up . let yourself go , go , like me !

what ' s that comin ' from the bar ?
sounds like singin ' .
you broke my nose !
it ain ' t broke .
<person> to our horses and bring us some food .
i ' m sorry but we have little to spare . the cardinal ' s guards were here today . they helped themselves to our food and then refused to pay .
i didn ' t talk to the cops . i talked to <person> !
where is she ?
well , what ' s the point of waiting ?
i agree . <continued_utterance> so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters ?
i ' ve got to work .
do you want me to go . ?

you ever think about dying ?
what do i need for that ?
we must start with feathers , dung , and a lock of your hair .
i wouldn ' t have guessed <person> was a sailor .

<person> . <person> guineas !
<person> guineas . <person> guineas . going going gone - to <person> .
my mother died in this canyon .

just that your mother died in tacoma . and you were in the marines . that was all . that was enough .
that ' s too bad . you could ' ve gotten some good details .
what are you doing today ?
buying <person> .
what ' s wrong with you ?
nothing . why ? do i seem different ?
and being sixteen .
they ' re in a hurry to grow up . they don ' t know about consequences or responsibility . that ' s being sixteen too . i promise you one thing .

<person> didn ' t kill <person> . why do you wan na do this ?
yes . but it was terrible .

<person> .

how ' s your book coming ?
there ' s a children ' s book editor i know , from the store , and she ' s excited to read it . when i finish it . who would ever have thought i ' d write ? i mean , if i didn ' t have all this free time , i would never have discovered -- she stops , realizing what she ' s saying . kathleen the truth is , he was the one who made me start thinking about writing --
i came to ask permission to take custody of your room .
my room ?
cuba .
<person> ? okay , i got work to do , see you guys downstairs .
sure i would -
do you like my music ?
and i love the inscription you wrote to me . only i ' m not quite the downy innocent you think i am .
i hope that isn ' t true . we need all the downy innocents we can get . grady spies the corner table , watches crabtree say
what ?
look up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . the whole country picks up and takes mexico .
ah , the bastard son . i thought <person> had killed you . that ' s what i would have done . he ' s as weak as you are .
no longer weak . i now rule <person> , until <person> awakens . perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me .
if that means i know it all , you ' re right , boss .
what do you know about the sphinx ?
its just another case , sailor .
whats that , peanut ?
they ' re right . this is intentional . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s stopped the <number> ships which are carrying contraband , and he ' s letting the ones which aren ' t go through , hoping for an incident . i think we should let them go .
if we do , it erodes the credibility of the quarantine . he ' ll just send more through tomorrow .
twinkle lights ?
little white christmas lights that twinkle . i use them in my window and on all my displays , as if you didn ' t notice .

<person> ?
i . r . s . fucking bandits ! bandits ! thieving sons of bitches !

you have a vivid imagination .
i haven ' t needed it lately . <continued_utterance> you ' re in for a disappointment .
i ' m just a messenger .
oh no . no way . i ' ve had all the bad news i can take for one day .
well , you know , if you can reach one person .
what is happiness to you , <person> ?

you look good . things ' re okay ?
i ' m happier in new york , sure , things are great . you guys ?
you jerking off or just pissed ?
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply ?
you ' re joking .
it ' s hard because i ' m a complete stranger and what we ' re talking about is incredibly personal . besides , the first time most people come here , a part of them is wondering if i ' m gon na think they ' re crazy . she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry , i ' m required to have at least three sessions in order to commit . <continued_utterance> now that ' s a joke . <continued_utterance> i have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life , one of which you may or may not be experiencing . if you want to get some stuff off your chest , great . if not .
you kiss your mother with that mouth ?
i ' d kiss your mother with this mouth . i mean , if she wasn ' t , you know .

i ' m working my ass off here . i ' ve taken care of absolutely everything <person> .
indian time . <continued_utterance> where ya gon na go , <person> ?
i ' ll have to see what the visions say about that one .
no , that ' s really all i have to --
may i respond ? first of all , i don ' t appreciate being spoken to with that kind of language . that ' s not the way i talk to you , and i ' d appreciate it if you wouldn ' t talk that way to me --
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gim me a break . you ' re not interested in my past , you ' re interested in my future as some kind of spy .
you ' re perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i ' m with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help .
me , too .
god , i don ' t get it . are we supposed to say to ourselves , be prepared to lose her , be prepared to lose our child ? why does this happen to someone ? how does it happen ?
well , wouldn ' t you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion ? i would .
no , of course not .
you know , i really should take your card .
<person> , you old sheep-fucker ! how the hell are ya ?
we ' re on fire !
<person> ' t let up , childs !
<person> on by what ?
heat , i think . the coincident invasion of a host , the fireman , and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six .
we tried to warn you .
sometimes young people need to make their own mistakes . that ' s how they learn .
oh yes . he ' s just had too much to drink , that ' s all . i hope you had a good time tonight . i wanted so much to make things up to you .
<person> was your idea ?
this is crazy ! if all my memories are false , who am i ? what am i ? jesus . it ' s like i don ' t exist .
you exist , all right . that ' s the problem .
oh , mom .
you ' re the only thing i care about . always will be .
if you want to live , don ' t hand up . <continued_utterance> they ' ve got you bugged . they ' re gon na find you . faster than you can say `` back rodgers '' . and don ' t bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull .
who are you ? what the hell is this ?
<person> is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?
she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .
had that stupid best seller , what was the name of it ?
watching grass grow was more exciting than <person> <person> .
excuse me ?
i said forget it , answer ' s no , i <person> ' t want the job and that ' s final . i ' m going to <person> and <person> ' short of dyin ' s gonn stop me . good day .
i put up new drapes , jake .
i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
<person> .
itandiacute ; s alright . itandiacute ; s alright .
i want these people in the cottages , not in the inn . it ' s safer .
well , it ' s the way it has to be .
oh . <continued_utterance> . you ' re a very bad man ! mcu -- the <person> reacts , speaks humbly --
oh , no , my dear -- i ' m -- i ' m a very good man . i ' m just a very bad <person> .
he never misses .
<person> . was that right ? that wasn ' t right .
<person> . <person> . we ' re in deep trouble . the package .
<person> ? what ?
my guess is dead .
<person> ?
i wouldn ' t know .
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas .
why didn ' t you say anything ?
i tried , believe me , but <person> wouldn ' t have it . it was too far-fetched for him . <person> was a grounded guy . an ex-cop . to a cop , the explanation is never that complicated . it ' s always simple . there ' s
<person> , <person> . i probly aint precisely got all the facts straight , but its about what they said .
<person> , were goin to bed now and its time to change the subject .
i thought i would need it .
and why , please tell us , would you think that ?
you ' re walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .
why do you need to wreck this company ?
<person> meet you , <person> , if thats what you want , but im against it .
seven tomorrow evenin . se can eat at galatoires . fix it .
then it ' s no longer a bomb ? <continued_utterance> let it blow .
but we can stop it .
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser <person> and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .
i never heard of him .
after the `` alleged '' deed was done , they fell asleep . big daddy lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears casanova sawing logs .
believe me , i needed the rest .
ball park sausages .
you want some breakfast meat , <person> . is that what you want ?
it ' s just she ' s been the focus for a while .
not the focus .

<person> ?

you ' re not driving me home because one , you don ' t live near my home and two , this piece of shit isn ' t driving anywhere . now what are we doing here ? why did you get off the highway ?
i told you , this is a shortcut . <person> , you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway . this used to be called `scenic <number> ' because there ' s an amazing view of the valley-
he said it was `` thor . ``
t-h-o-r . and your relationship to him ?
that would be wonderful , but it ' s only been a year since <person> died .
what are you afraid of ? what people think ?
<person> ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?
i think i burned my gun hand !
how so ?
football wasn ' t the kind of life i wanted . for ten years i ' d be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it wasn ' t that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . i ' ve seen way too much of it in my job . i can barely take it when my clients are in pain . i don ' t hate the game . i admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , i was in awe of how he could play it , but i couldn ' t give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it ' s not a thing many people would understand .
you ' re telling me you didn ' t just hear me banging on the door ?
i don ' t know what you ' re-
i ' ll sell it to you .
you monster . how much for ?
that ' s what i hear . <person> ' t matter . girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .
well , this is it . we get the car , find some americans . we find americans we ' ll be all right .
some . <person> said <person> promised to have him and <person> out of here by the weekend .
<person> make em happy .
oh , don ' t mention it ! it was a pleasure having you here ! i hope you ' ll find what you ' re looking for very soon !
so do we .
well , it was just a dream , i --
<person> ! what ' s with you , <person> ? who are you ?
you don ' t see what ' s going on here , do you ? there ' s four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas . <person> have been lost . no suspects have been named . so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . that the fbi didn ' t do its job .
and they want to blame us ?
-- i don ' t know if you ' re alive or dead --
i ' m sorry --
<person> ? are you nuts ?
but you said she was a sparkplug . ?
he ' s the assistant chief of anesthesiology , <person> . he says your doctors , <person> and <person> , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we don ' t know is why . what went on in there ? in the o . r . that ' s what we ' d like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang . someone got distracted . what ?
. you got your doctor ' s testimony . why do you need me ?
another accident ? you got to be more careful .
what the hell happened to my car ?
no . <continued_utterance> how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldn ' t even tell myself ?
what are you going to do ?
why didn ' t you dive ?
with all the horror that ' s going on in the world , what difference does it make ?
what ' s that mean ?
i get a ' s . all a ' s .
who ?
i don ' t know . me .
funny you should say `` peachy . ``
i did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .
i went to see <person> about the divorce . <continued_utterance> he was not too agreeable , and one thing led to another , and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter .
what ? !
it ' s time to tell him . it would be the right thing .
maybe . but that ' s not the real reason . you think if i tell , he ' ll disappear and that ' s what you want ! me all to yourself !
i ' m sorry .
i wish i could believe you .
you know . sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth .
yes . i . yes .
that ' s what i thought . <continued_utterance> <person> , a second blanket . one for me , one for you .
<person> ?
this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . i busted her once for possession . she wound up doing about six months at <person> nine .
you mean <person> sixty-nine . <continued_utterance> that ' s what they called it when i was in juvenile . it ' s a pretty dismal place .
<person> , okay . <continued_utterance> that ' s good coke .
it should be . it ' s yours . i want our debt forgiven . i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states . and i want the principle witness against my husband , <person> , killed .
<person> , it ' s there . looks a little different , but it ' s there .
i see what you mean . <continued_utterance> yes , we both have bioports .
mr . <person> -- thank you for the chance . you won ' t regret this , you ' re with a winner .
. put the rest of it in a money market account for now . i want to see what you know before i invest it . and save the cheap salesman talk , it ' s obvious .
<person> ' t it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?
from your lips , to <person> ' s ears .
i wasn ' t the one drinking .
your blood alcohol level . maybe you were legally in the clear , but i make the rules here .
all right , <person> . no more games . grace games ? <continued_utterance> you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i don ' t go for being jerked around .
really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
not a woman i have any use for . she ' s sold me to this outfit when i was <number> .
she sold you ?
it looks that way .
you know what that would mean ? <continued_utterance> to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he ' ll testify ?
<person> , i ' d like you to meet <person> .
it ' s too early in the morning for me to be cordial . you got any coffee ?
thank you . you are cleared .
janice , how many years have you been buzzing us in ?
<person> , <person> , i ' ve got places to be .
<person> --
oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we ' ll oil him up .
-- a hot water bottle would be good if we had one .
<person> this out . <person> !
i better go , dad .
of course .
letandiacute ; s take a walk .
after midterms we ' ll finish our run down to curacao . <continued_utterance> i have arranged to host a good will cruise for the dutch students of the local school there .
<person> , rapture .
where the hell did you come from ?
i trusted you .
there are no vets . we ' ve scarcely any horses left .
he ' s cut all over , but this leg here ' s got the worst of it .
<person> to the water . the river keeps goin ' down then rising again .
they ' re drainin ' our water table . that ' s our life , man . <person> is looking past crow horse at --
county . i was in for fraud .
you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ?
<person> . see you in a minute . <continued_utterance> <person> , i don ' t think he ' s slowing down .
he ' ll slow down .
you know you almost got us both killed back there ?
fun though , wasn ' t it ?
you can ' t take him out this late in the game .
<person> will eat him alive !
you don ' t need eagle to qualify ! you need to get used to playing smart -- no mistakes wins the open .
<person> ? i want the course record ! now gim me the lumber !
follow him ? mr . gekko i . it ' s not what i do . i could lose my license . if the sec found out , i could go to jail . it ' s inside information , isn ' t it ?
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying i ' m gon na buy teldar paper ? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it ' s time to blow out xyz . you mean that ? i ' m afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and i are gon na have a hard time doing any business .
<person> , <person> threw my baseball down the street ; and i can ' t find it !
well , we ' ll look for it real hard later . let me talk to mommy .
but there ' s nothing we can do without defying <person> . <continued_utterance> no . stop there ! i know that look !
it ' s the only way to ensure the safety of our borders .
stop the car !
twenty-four hours a day i live with the aching possibility that you might call me to do something .
way i hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys .
<person> , but .
you ' re not a bigot , is that what you ' re telling us ?
me ? no , i ' m not a bigot .
<person> , well , it just played out that way . i have to get going .
well can we put some of that in the business account so they don ' t take our copier back ?
you can trust me completely .
i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i don ' t think it ' ll be too hard to -- <continued_utterance> take cover ! <continued_utterance> let ' s hit ' em ! <continued_utterance> cover me . <continued_utterance> clear .
where ' d they go ?
a lot of people are taking the opportunity to jump on the anti- game bandwagon . they ' ve now heard rumours about what the existenz system is , and they say we ' ve gone too far psychologically , medically , socially , you name it . and i ' m afraid i wouldn ' t put it past our competitors to be involved in this , to try to whip up public opinion and kill our new system before it gets born . <continued_utterance> you ' re sure you don ' t want me to contact <person> , even just to see what they have to say ?
not yet , <person> . thanks .
well , i guess that ' s to be expected .
no , not right now .
you played pool for me ?
<person> , i had no choice .

grand marnier .
<person> , i ' m driving away now and i don ' t want you to bother me again . you came for my advice , correct ?
absolutely .
you want solid ? that one , single , print he left in the badlands -- the one the fbi missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first . like a white man . <person> has a serious ind ' n walk -- ball of the foot first . the man who murdered <person> walked like a wasi ' cu .
you ' re saying a white guy did it .
what happened ?
poor soul , he was so high-strung . afraid the strain was more than he could bear . <continued_utterance> let ' s go ! my horse is over here .
about what ?
the faa announcement .
my parents always say hard work builds character .

no mistake . i have reports from the local constables involved .
musketeers .

that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn ' t have to be explained --
<person> you ' re masking hostility .
<person> , put those away !
we just have to wait .
i have a gift for you . something that belonged to my father . he would have wanted you to have it .
<person> ' t know any doctor jokes .

mom , wake up ! dad barely knows we exist .
yes .
why ?
do you think the police will . find him ?
i know they haven ' t assigned anyone to it specifically . it ' s an old case .
ambitious .
being negative ' s a lot more work than being positive .
are we being watched ?
i ' m not taking any chances .
how about that one ? the host of the old south hotel .
<person> more like the ghost of the old south , but well try her .
that ' s it , <person> ? you ' re gon na spend the day measuring people ' s feet ? ' you ' re an `` e '' fit . you ' re a `` d '' wide . you got a high arch . i ' ll show you something in an alligator . something with a wing tip . ' how can you talk about that all day long ? <person> , you ' re the best tin man there ever was . <person> ' s a better closer .
it ' s over , bb . it ' s over .

i never said he is clean . i just said he isn ' t our target .
sick . you ever had a bee buzz your face that wouldn ' t go away ?
sure . once or twice .
i see . well , maybe you ' d like it . <person> was difficult for me , though -- classes were hard , and the boys seemed cold -- interested in money and social position . and i hated those snowy pennsylvania winters ! but then in my last year , something changed . the guys in my class grew close , so close that i still think of them as a second family .
i want that . i do , and --
which three books ?
i don ' t know . -- is it important ? filby no , i suppose not . - only . what three books would you have taken ?
nothing .
<person> ? apple ? yogurt ? you like yogurt .
<person> ?
i think there ' s a lot of truth in that . i ' m gon na pursue some options . i want to join that <person> thing .
so are we . its the only motel in big tuna . have you met <person> like the country peru yet ?
no , we just got in a hour and a half ago .
i ' m <person> ' s friend , <person> . <person> to disturb you .
that ' s ok . it was something i ate . so wait , are you <person> ' s boyfriend ?
a rumor - from an anonymous source -
- that <person> may be involved with <person> and <person> , and the missing <person> .
she ' s in the bathroom . she ' s still working .
she ' s still working ?
yes . i miss the army .
where are you going to be sent , sir ?
a rope !
no . the truth ! she thought i was dead -- those blades were meant for you . what do you know that she would kill you for ?
i looked the other way when you did a lot of foul things but i <person> ' t lettin ' you torment a dyin ' man . not as long as he ' s under my roof . i draw the line there .
all right , hooker . i ' ll be back in about an hour . we ' ll see how <person> you are then .
yeah .
wow . i thought i was the only one .
oh , all this packing makes me hungry . what would you say to dinner at , uh , oh , <person> ?
<person> ? ! oh , cool !
that ' s enough , <person> .
i don ' t know what you came here for , but we won ' t have any part of it .
what about you ? <continued_utterance> it ' s a ninety-one ! it ' s an ' a ' !
i know .
you ' re fine like that , <person> .
there ' s hot cider in the kitchen .
ah , i got a date tonight with that <person> girl i told you about .
the sawbones ?
the good witch .
<person> . <person> loves you .
what ?
if you don ' t tie up all the lose ends it ' ll never be over .
<person> ? what are you doing here ?
i had to see you .
did she say that ?
more or less .
<person> . we don ' t know anything yet . she could be anywhere .
i ' m gon na take you back to the office . will you put out a call on <person> ' s car for me ?
<person> was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
<person> was a patriot . the men he ' s loyal to know their way around dallas . they blew that building to hide something . maybe something even they couldn ' t predict .
he kept saying , `` let it happen , let it happen . `` then he just stopped .
you mean he withdrew .
yes !
i should risk coming right over the top and snap-hooking it out of bounds left .
no , it ' s that when do you have time to be parents to him ? you guys don ' t pick him up until nine , ten at night . you are into yourselves , as the saying goes . spend some time trying to be parents . <person> him to the mountains , fishing . you ought to let him get to know nature .
well , you are his grandfather . he is supposed to spend some time with you . you ' re supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that .
i ' ve been thinking about that . a birthday celebration when we ' re on the brink of war .
your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their king at a time like this .
we will .
so where to on the honeymoon ?
no , i didn ' t .
it says she was originally <person> rigged , but <person> turned her into a brigantine . i think square rigs look so much more romantic .
i believe you . did that nice doctor let you out ? or-is this you improvising again , <person> ?
i ' m through improvising .
<person> our surprise when they began to gestate . my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists , facilitating their programs . to give us access to the virus . in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure . so that we might save ourselves , as the last of the species . your father wisely refused to believe this , choosing hope over selfishness . <person> is the only future he had : his children , the only future any of us have .
but . he sacrificed his own daughter .
you too .
what ' s your idea of the whole night ?
<person> to your stomach ? a hotshot like you ?
i ' m not a hotshot .
we start at <number> : <number> pm . <person> ' t be late .
my brother ! i will not let you down . to the team . <continued_utterance> hey , what should i wear to practice ?
we only know each other -- oh god , you ' re not going to believe this --
let me guess . from the internet .
what time did he show up ?
around four . <person> and these pachucos poppin ' switchblades like punks . the only thing that was keepin ' him `untouched ' was <person> . is he really dead ?
<person> to hear that . i thought the kid had staying power .
it ' s over you , <person> .
<person> . she left the store to me , and i ' m going to leave it to my daughter .
how old is your daughter now ?
can i walk with you a little ?
sure , yeah --
my little thing on the internet is just a lark .
so it ' s still going on ?
it ' s because you don ' t eat .
i eat .
then give me the money i earn !
<person> , no . i ' m putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it -- cuss me now , thank me later .
engaged ? are you crazy ?
i thought you liked <person> --
case daddy dont like me . what if he dont like that i dont got his color hair .
<person> , your daddyd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all .
. well ! i do believe this requires further investigation !
thank you , <person>iot .
boys , i need to talk to mr . <person> alone . find your own breakfast . here ' s a five spot . make it a feast .
you ' re always so generous with my money .
i ' m glad he protects you . this is a lethal canine .
i love living here . and i refuse to clean up !
oh really ? well , i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye , because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june .
you could have a great beach house for that .
well , you will . you always do .
i ' m not sure i like the idea of all this overhead breathing down my neck . when you have a place like this , that ' s a lot of overhead .
going to asheville to see my parents .
i can ' t do this without you .
hey , <person> . get me some water . or you ' ll diiiiie . !
i will -- i ' ll getcha water -- getcha lotsa water -- anything you say -- !
i told you not to worry about the musketeers . they are dead by now .
<person> ' s signature will be on the treaty by morning .
i ' ll get you a coffee . won ' t be a minute .
<person> ' s just sit down and kick this around . <continued_utterance> no hurry , ma ' am . <continued_utterance> what you doing throwing your money around ?
i don ' t care . cancel it .
no way . <continued_utterance> i ' m not calling and cancelling on daly . you call and cancel on daly .
because <person> is a loser , you said so yourself . he ' s a goon . <person> is the one . he loves you with that `` lasting love '' . `` true love '' .
yes , <person> is very sweet . why don ' t you get out your violin , <person> ?
so did i , till i hit <number> and found i had all the royal habits and no throne . <person> got by but i had to go to work just like you . only the skills i had were shopping and making friends . so . that ' s why i do what i do , what makes you tick , <person> ?
fear . the fear of being poor i guess , just like you , <person> . but that ' s all gon na change sweetheart . i ' m catching the express . . and you ' re going along for the ride .
what ' s the deal ?
oh come on , don ' t feel bad . you got played , so what ? you ' re new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?
<person> to fix . <person> .
and i ' m <person> .
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
knock it off , <person> , just ' cause you ' re in love doesn ' t mean everyone else has to be .
you mean <person> ? then why are you with him ?
well he ' s handsome and he ' s charming . he ' s all right . for now . <person> ' t say it , i know , i ' m <person> . i can ' t help it . i ' ve <person> to be good but it ' s too boring .
actually . . i just want to go home .
oh , don ' t be silly . no one your age just wants to go home . besides , faculty will be present . just think of it as a field trip .
. you ' re ' sposed to be in court in ten days and she ' s telling me you haven ' t even met with them .
<person> , now who is that ?
has a lot of rain . <continued_utterance> you ' re gon na get us hung up .
do not talk to the driver .
who ?
people know . it ' s time to stop .
<person> morning , mr . o ' <person> . mr . <person> .
what ' s it about ?
yeah . russian minister of transportation .
she married a hockey player .
i assume they finished it , then the gods descended .
<person> , that ' s probably it . so you ' re saying we can ' t go in ?
this island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place .
it has its moments of uncertainty .
oh , but i ' ve already told you , i ' m not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly . what was that ? mcu -- <person> looks to r . f . g . and speaks --
the munchkins . they ' re laughing because i am a witch . i ' m <person> , the witch of the north .
<person> , cut the crap , what really happened with <person> ?
nothing . i mean , you know my brother . <person> .
you sure you can manage ?
i got it .
yes , but . how do you expect .
clearly you did not understand . you did not even attempt relations last evening .
good . that was good . where do i go ?
it ' s a place called <person> ' s <person> . the address is <number> north east <number> . it ' s under your name .
yeah , and you obviously still have a hard-on for the doctor chick -- your face is all screwed up and tight like you haven ' t been laid in awhile --
is it really that obvious ?
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .
we ' ll have to go after them .
what is it ?
a menorah .
this fence . it ' s so .
i ' m sorry . it ' s for the flowers . why don ' t you .
but that ' s how it works with parties . you have to be invited .
i ' m mad at you , you dick . we made love four times the other night .
so , <person> . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate <person> at the annual bake sale .
that ' s just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
<person> , my god ! you ' re shot to pieces !
no .
i got one on me at lake lanier . <person> poured salt on it and it dropped off . <person> awful . he was a cute boy , though , so it was almost worth it .
<person> , well listen to this . <person> said back in the <number> s a i-talian doctor figured out that if , say , a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in , say , a barfight or somethin , theyd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks . then put leeches on it .
a pretty young maiden she happened my way .
give me some time to blow the man down .
what ?
you ' re getting a forty dollar raise per week . that ' s it . <continued_utterance> i checked . you were right . you ' ve never taken a sick day . five years , no sick days . i get it . you want a raise . you made your point . <continued_utterance> all right fifty dollars and that ' s the god damn limit . are we done here ?
<person> carefully ?
what about the game ?
shut up and hit the ball . mccord the ledge still has to be thinking about that brutal , ego-sapping , manhood-robbing eighty-three he buried himself under yesterday . i mean , that ' s just an avalanche of golf swings , a landslide , a pyroclastic flow --
dollar bills .
hook ? that ' s an unfortunate choice of words .
<person> ' s going be great . he won ' t hurt her again . i know it .
we don ' t owe him anything !
we owe him that ! he got you started in this business . he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures . before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like price ! he took care of you before you were hot ! silence . she ' s hitting home but he doesn ' t want to acknowledge it .
i dig her . and i ' ve never said this to you before , about any girl . but she could be . could be could be could be . the girl of my fuckin dreams .
you ' re not from ohio .
can i help you with something ?
<person> called . you know where we can find her ?
hello ?
are you finished with your call ?
it says here he ' s an m . d .
he is . that is , he was . he switched careers and became a physicist . he ' s quite brilliant , really . <continued_utterance> if you would just release him to me , i promise to keep an eye on him .
four kids , three different guys .
three different guys ?
well . you go outta here . take a left , then down past the first . no second .
can you get us there ?
then where are you gon na put the tub ?
just give me the playpen .
<person> , <person> , the truth is . i ' ll be in town for a while now but i don ' t think we should see each other for a few weeks .
why not ?
it ' s just a matter of time .
no . we ' ve missed something .
really ? that ' s remarkable .
i have trouble sleeping . while i ' m lying in bed i figure them out . the stories .
<person> . you had a vision . you got sign from the old ones .
what the hell do you want me to do ? !
must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown . not one of them so much as lifted a finger . - a curious attitude - in a curious world . <person> ' t you the least bit interested in what i am . where i come from ? the girl should i be ? time traveller perhaps you ' d better take me to someone a bit older i can talk to .
there is no one older .
never stopped dancing .
can we help ?
nice .
<person> stunning .
that you did the best you could .
<person> good news ?
no . the memory will keep me company .
do you know the cardinal ' s plans ?
yes .
ah . how did they treat you ?
i told you , it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes .
you should practice lying more often . you ' re awful at it . where to ?
it was .
and that you ' re scamming on <person> .
why don ' t you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer ?
well sure , neighbor , easy to say .
where you coming from ?
all over . chicago , <person> , detroit . just lately <person> .
if you can , you be the first .
he does have the occasional tendency towards self-destruction it seems .
i don ' t get it . <person> ' t they tell you we were gon na be here today ?
sure they told us ! so what ? that doesn ' t make the last four days any less hellish than they were !
if you ' re going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .
what happens when you lose ?
there is no past .
<person> ' t you ever wonder about the future ?
you can ' t . you told the judge you were keeping <person> at home .
i know .
<person> , well , i ' ve been thinking about that . <person> , there was an explosion and everything , but i never really aaw <person> get killed . and nobody ever found the gold . i guess they both could have been burned to slag . i guess . but there were a lot of bodies out on that road . a smart man could have found some identification to use . a smart man could have made his way up to syria or turkey . a smart man could have gotten himself right out of the middle east . a smart man with enough gold . way i figure , right about now old <person> is sitting in a bar in sydney , or melboure , or maybe brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest aussies you ever saw .
i find it highly unlikely that anyone could accomplish such a thing .
that makes three of us .
is that right ? so we all share the same guilt . <continued_utterance> here . this is <person> <person> shortly after he was admitted here in <number> . <continued_utterance> -- to put the situation right . the hypodermic needles are only used to give you medication that will calm you down . they make you feel good , relaxed . all right ? we ' re not putting anything in your food either . the food is just food .
after the kidnapping . i was afraid to go outside , to be alone , to be in a crowd , to do anything at all , until i realized . there ' s no point in living if you can ' t . feel alive . she looks out at the fading sun . <continued_utterance> i can ' t huddle in the shadows . i can ' t let fear run my life . i won ' t . <continued_utterance> the way i acted , in the snow . you must think i ' m a coward .
i think you ' re one of the bravest people i ' ve ever met .
well , why shouldn ' t she ?
no reason . unless she has hypoglycemia .
where am i ?
he ' s all right .
and what do you call this ?
- the family jewels ?
wow . that ' s kind of a downer isn ' t it ?
it ' s the way of the world .
. get the records of his testimony in the twelve malpractice cases .
do it . we ' ll be at locke-obers .
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindus lifetime to unfix . you better get a move on , <person> , before that boy got her holdin down a memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms .
really , <person> , you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than <person> got pills . <person> to take it easy . go over to <person> for a few days .
then how do you explain what he ' s doing ?
just his instincts . he was well trained by e . i . o . maybe the memory cap ' s fractured . portions of his prior identity could be leaking through .
nothing . i ' m just glad to see you . i ' m glad you called me .
i bet you were surprised . !
your father . <continued_utterance> well now it belongs to me . i collect swords . i take them from the men i kill .
i ' m not dead yet .
practice .
i don ' t believe we ' ve met .
why does he need money ?
he has debts . he has gambling debts . he owes a lot of money .
i can ' t throw that far . you got to climb down here and get the keys . you can make it . it ' s the only way <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> ! . <person> , <person> ! you have to help me . <person> takes a look around .
<person> . i ' m coming . <person> down ! <continued_utterance> why ' s that ?
not dr . leo <person> ?
do you know him ?
<person> ' t worry , boy . you won ' t feel a thing .
where is <person> today ?
kid , if you hit me on the head , i ' m gon na throw you out this window .
<person>my !
we should play some time . i mean , if you can afford to lose some money .
what are you ?
i envy your ' undercover ' assignments .
we work in the dark . we do what we can .
musketeers are not afraid of anything .
i knew it . i knew you were a musketeer the moment i saw you .
what the hell is wrong with you ? what did i do ?
you drove us here , that ' s what you did ! ! what the hell did you think you were doing ! ?
better . i was really angry .
i know .
i ' m afraid she ' ll say no .
ahh . so what you ' re saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game -- not about your personal life .
you ' re not capable of it .
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
come on tough guy . <person> to me . you are going to tell <person> that it was all an accident . <person> cowboy ? you got me ?
i love you .
ohhh !
times being what they were , i accepted the job , -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away . and in that balloon , my dear <person> , you and i will return to the land of e pluribus unum !
somewhere safe .
where ?
you should come to our temple .
i ' m not really religious .
what you call myths , we call our history .
it ' s not real .
uhhhh -- yes .
i don ' t believe you !
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car ' s his .
such as .
this is .
we know each other .
what ?
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car .
dust it for prints . my guess is , if anybody murdered <person> it was probably that little sociopath <person> <person> .
how soon can we get something ?
well . you made a commitment to this bank , <person> . to this job .
i know i ' d --
dead !
how the hell .
close the door . <person> down . <continued_utterance> why do you think i ' m sending him home ?
he killed the dolphin .
we have plantations . <continued_utterance> <person> , cotton fields , <person> , sunflowers , the mississippi river .
put the river behind me .
you have dangerous coworkers , dr .
<person> , not dangerous . he was distraught when he found out that you ' d taken all of our research . it was years of his life , gone ! he got depressed , started drinking , and . well , you know the rest .
mr . <person> . i ' m afraid you ' re not really standing here at this moment .
sat that again .
i don ' t know . into the woods .
<person> . it ' s freezing out here . <person> ' s just get in the car and you can tell me what happened .
you exist , all right . that ' s the problem .
why did you try to kill me ?
no charge .
<person> , <person> , about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i ' m going i swear i ' ll --
i figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of <person> <person> ' s business connections in the third world countries with c . i . a . influence .
oh . i assumed you ' d just look him in the eye and say `` gim me a break , for crissakes , <person> , are you a spy or aren ' t you ? ''
was it him ? the cop you were telling me about ?
i don ' t want you to worry . i ' m handling it . but i might send my friend <person> out there .
all right , cornell . come with me . <continued_utterance> are you sure-footed , <person> ?
i believe so .
that definitely isn ' t a cow .
well , what is it ?
what about them ?
do me a favor keep sending them .
they ' re kind of suited , in a lot of ways .
some people are .
i ' ll have to perform one of my . operations !
no-o-o . <person> ' t touch her ! no !
and no phone .
or an automobile accident . those cab drivers are maniacs .
no , no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself .
but i didn ' t scare you ?
i ' ll bet .
are you gon na call him , <person> ?
<person> ' s store .
who ' s that ?
i ' m not sure .
<person> carefully ?
i was joking .
i ain ' t .
no . i don ' t think you ' ll do that .
why not ?
<person> , come in !
mr . <person> ?
we ' re doing something -- ?
before we do this , i just want to say that a good life ' s got ta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list . <continued_utterance> it ' s about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know , spontaneously .
you know who ?
maybe .
that you made mine .
i ' m sorry .
a blindfold , cigarette , noseplugs ?
i think you want a drink . how about it , judge ?
do you trust me , <person> ?
not a chance .
unless you need me to come home .
no , no . it ' s fine .
getting late . we better get back .
so i assume we ' re regarding this as just a kind of interlude .
leave the tools .
i already did . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
well , i ' ve had it up to my ass with sedate ! you said you and me was gon na get outta town and , for once , just really let our hair down . well , darlin , ' look out ' cause my hair is comin ' down !

what is it , <person> ? you haven ' t the guts ?
you spineless paper tiger - <continued_utterance> where is she , <person> ? ! ? or did you kill her like paris ?
seriously , it ' s like we ' re being reborn . we really could reinvent ourselves here , just like you said . nobody knows about your massive humiliation .
nobody knows about your mental retardation .
how long do you suppose they ' ve been gone ?
i haven ' t seen them since their last feeding . could be as much as twenty- four hours .
you know a dealer named <person> , <person> ?
you know a religious guy named <person> ?
what are you going to do ?
i don ' t know . send the money i guess .
hold on , <person> !
i can ' t do it ! take care of <person> for me !
we ' ve got three . guy mowing his yard , couple of kids playing hoops .
and what do they say ?
it ' s too dangerous . we ' ll find another couple . a better one .
it ' s not fair .
we ' ve already done the interesting part . do you forget ?
remind me .
yes , mr . <person> ?
i would be willing to serve as mr .
a single hour .
yes .
what do you mean , make you a list ? -- <person> ' t you do the shopping yourself ?
no shopping or laundry or housekeeping . i am a professional nanny .

not as far as i ' m concerned .
but this is <person> .
i laugh sometimes
yes , but how often ? tell me , are you happy ?
that ' s an old joke . my question was serious .
so was i . you ever dream about me ?
because it would have been too much work to leave him here . i couldn ' t have done it .
then you shouldn ' t have taken him .
just play one set of downs .
why ' d you do that ?
i keep thinking , if we were but half serious about money , we should quit being hired hands and .
<person> , <person> . we ' re handymen .
whaddaya mean , sitting there ? i happen to be getting ready to fly this airplane .
<person> , forget it .

she ' s beautiful .
<person> ?
what time is it ?
i want to see my son !
then call him ! you have his number !
you don ' t have to imagine it . not anymore . now all you ' ve got to think up is what it ' s going to buy you .
wes !
i think you have a gift for it . it was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness .
meanness ? let me tell you --
it was the visit to that god damned <person> !
in all honesty you need to be looking forward , not back .
<person> ' t think people , just go ! go , go , go , go , go ! ! ! swim you win , stay you pay ! !
now what ' s the problem , <person> ? everybody swims .
so what brings you to <person> , mr . <person> ? <person> - don ' t tell me : <person> marriage ? running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in - london ?
actually , i ' m here on business . you might say it was a . <person> opportunity .
he ' s a farmer ; i ' m a herdsman .
you ' re a suck , is what you are .
no . <person> was a battered wife and <person> was a suborned whore . if that ' s not motive , what is ? you want answers then we brace those two hard .
if you do so directly , if they ' re formally questioned then <person> may find out and go after them with federal warrants .
. the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius . anybody that can ' t make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on , immediately -- gib whips around to <person> , lowering his headset mike .
i can get <number> <person> here in about <number> minutes . they ' re on maneuvers out of <person> .
what do you mean it doesn ' t change anything ? have a heart , brendan .
you listen to me . you take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road . run it out on someone who doesn ' t know you like i do .
how can you be with a man you ' re frightened of ?
i ' m not . i don ' t have to feel afraid of him if i don ' t feel anything . after all these years , i ' ve learned how to do it so well . i tell myself , `` i ' m managing . i can manage him . august loves me . nobody else ever did . who am i to say it ' s the wrong kind of love ? '' . <person> , there ' s no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world . you know where they found me when i was a baby ? .
i don ' t care . we paid for her . go back to sleep , monsieur .
<person> ! madmartigan . i never should ' ve trusted you .
no .
why ' s that ?
<person> , well , she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar , too .
i ' m not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello .
what was that ?
anonymous . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been getting ninety-sixes my whole life . it ' s what they expect . after all this , i still haven ' t figured it out .
i think you ' d make an excellent <person> .
that ' s what i ' m thinking .
he ' s doing ok . he can say some pretty funny things . yesterday he told me i was fired .
<person> ? for what ?
<person> , <person> , you know it ' s not that easy .
yes it is .
but why all of this ?
we had to watchdog you . make sure the erasure took . a wife seemed like a good idea .
we ' re new in town .
welcome to <person> ' s game emporium . i ' m <person> . is there anything i can help you with ?
no . <person> , you don ' t understand .
trust me , i understand . i just want to say something to you , <person> .
what is it ?
easy now . that mare ' s in season .
<person> . forget him .
i can ' t help it . he gives me the creeps . i mean why was <person> so scared of him ? she ' s not that way . i think he did something .
i ' m inside the police mainframe . do you see anything ?
what ?
<person> !
my doctors didn ' t want a settlement at any price . they wanted this cleared up in court . they want their vindication . i agree with them . but for today the offer stands . before we begin the publicity of a trial . for today only . when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn . as long as you understand that . it ' s got to be that way .
sax . <person> sax .
how ' s the school here ?
it ' s all right . i don ' t like it , but it ' s over now .
i never had anything before , <person> . i never was anybody . not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins . when i was in high school i used to -- fed up with <person> <person> turns on him hard .
i presented you with that option . <continued_utterance> i ' m also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi .
we had that conversation . i was paying medical bills . is that in your file ?
you have <person> ' s towel . what the fuck did you do to her ? !
<person> ' towel .
you ' re looking more like a butcher than a mechanic .
things do get kinda confused these days , don ' t they ? i ' m gon na go wash up . you two make yourselves at home .
according to this tag .
and you ' re looking for ? <continued_utterance> i can tell you that without even looking at him . conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris . <continued_utterance> this body has already been autopsied , <person> . you can tell from the way it ' s been wrapped and dressed .
you ' re a goddamn tin man !
wait a minute ! wait a minute !
where is she then ?
she could be out . she could be sick in bed for all we know .
aside from the fact that <person> ' s eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and <person> spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn ' t broken , things couldn ' t be better .
i miss them , too .
. a turner , a perfect canary diaiaond . a lear jet . world peace . the best of everything .
well , why stop at that ?
leave us . <continued_utterance> and what action would you take ?
march into jotunheim as you once did , teach them a lesson , break their spirits so they ' ll never dare try to cross our borders again !
how much ? <continued_utterance> you ' re kidding ! and a car ?
and a car .
<person> .
<person> shoulder . looks painful .
one hand in front of the other son . we ' ll do it together . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t look down . look in my eyes !
i can ' t .
why ?
i think you must have an idea . they cited a history of problems relating back to <number> .
he ' s just raffish . <person> put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on <person> <number> , that old fox .
i can ' t accuse him just dry long
well , excuse me for askin ' , <person> , but isn ' t it kinda dead in here ?
you see that bird at the faro <person> ? that ' s <person> . he barged in here one day , said he was takin ' over the game , started <person> ' customer , wavin ' his gun around , scarin ' off all the high-class play . only trade comes in here now ' s just bummers and drovers , just the dregs .
well i ' m real scared .
<person> right you ' re scared . i can see it in your eyes . <continued_utterance> go ahead . <person> it . <person> that <person> wagon and see what happens .
i ' m thinking about when this war is over . why you figure i ' m here ? ' <person> got tired of being president of gm ? if a brother doesn ' t play ball , or deal drugs there aren ' t too many big money prospects around , and i ' m not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies ' wars . so i say if maybe there ' s something out there , what the hell , that ' s what i say .
it ' s desertion .
friday ? well . there was one couple , but they didn ' t say where they were from .
<person> ' s mother ' s called three times this morning . said she hasn ' t heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn ' t show up for work yesterday or today .
uh . in the , well , in the interests of her family . you , dr . gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st . <person> ' s a very well thought of institution . her doctors .
her doctors killed her .
you mean that horrible screeching ?
it wasn ' t constructed for its aesthetic values , you know , but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter . now go on .
let ' s go !
hey , <person> ? ! where are the matches ? oh , oh , wait , here they are . <person> .

i don ' t take sides . i take pictures .

i ' m a full-blood <person> .
we ' ve driven a long way . where is this place ?
have you checked the children ?
what ?
what are you talking about ? bobby when i got back from the garage , and your jeep wasn ' t there , i thought you ' d gone and left me and taken the money . . cause i never had any luck with women , <person> . you don ' t know what i been through . the shit i ' ve taken . i thought you were like the rest of ' em . but when you came out of the house . well you ' re here <person> and we might be starting in the shit but we ' re starting where i never been -- together with

then you ' d better work on it in the car . we got ta go see the judge .
<person>dy , it ' s not a question of enough . it ' s a zero sum game , sport . somebody wins and somebody loses . money itself isn ' t lost or made , it ' s simply transferred from one perception to another . <person> magic . that painting cost $ <number> , <number> <number> years ago . i could sell it today for $ <number> , <number> . the illusion has become real . and the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it .

i never said .

but everything in this game is so realistic . i don ' t think i really could .

<person> steps .
when you leave this office , don ' t think about everything you have to do to get out of the building , just deal with getting out of the room . when you reach the hall , just deal with the hall . and so forth . <person> steps .
what happened ?
the old witch killed ' em both .
i think you ' re one of the bravest people i ' ve ever met .
what is it ?
-- if they mine uranium there , these people will have no place left to go .
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters , <person> . i don ' t know about uranium , i don ' t know about <person> -- all i know is we did our job . it ' s over .
<person> -- play something with some blood in it ! i feel like dancing ! <continued_utterance> care to dance , <person> ?

you ' re gon na have a ball . <continued_utterance> hands off . i need an interpreter more than you do right now .
you still hanging in there with <person> ?
your article sucked .
in what sense ?
why are you always afraid to get somewhere ?
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , <person> , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .
he has ? i didn ' t hear him .
he ' s in his room .
yeah .
what have you got ?
oh , <person> , is that the best you can come up with ?
this is my bathroom , and i say about the toothpaste , got it ? huh ? have you ? huh ? now if you lived with your daddy <person> and his rich wife , maybe things ' d be different , but he ' s not here now , is he ? oh , <person> ? <person> , are you here ? dukie ? oh , how sad -- <person> ' s not here . oh , boo hoo ! my bathroom . i get to say . got that ?

your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . i have them soaking . you can wear these .
the way <person> dances , and he ' s funny . it ' s easy to see yourself married to him .
and <person> ?
i need to kill our waiter .
oh , well , that makes sense .
when <person> died you told me <person> wanted her more , loved her more --
i was wrong . nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did . not even <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> loaned you to me , entrusted you to my care . i ' m failing you . <continued_utterance> <person> . i make you the same promise that <person> does . i will always be with you .
oh shit .
<person> tank must ' ve been ruptured in the accident .
no . i wasn ' t even born yet .
were you ever in the army ?
we ' ll get him .
yes . you will . <person> , i still want you in charge , even though your cover is blown . just keep a low profile . i generally prefer it when my covert operations don ' t make the front page .
some babies are allergic to iron .
oh , okay , well i ' ll take this kind then .
here he is . he ' s my bull man .
all right . see this animal . this here ' s the stupidest goddamn animal on the face of god ' s good earth . here ' s your bull hook . you ' re gon na need it .
get in bed . y ' ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you ' re turning into a yuppie <person> , you love money so much .
sure , why not , money ' s the sex of the <number> ' s . i never had it like you when i was growing up , baby , it wasn ' t the upper east side .
you a sailor man ? that ' d be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .
i hope so . <person> , mckenna about your wife : if i had known she was married --
anything you ' d like to say to future constituents ?
i like my <person> with mustard and relish !
i told you , i wasn ' t breaking into your house . i was looking for your wife .

it ' s full of freudian symbols , dad . it ' s educational .

i would have been laughed right out of xenia .
no one will be laughing at you now , ted . you can take that to the bank .
<person> ! !
<person> , i hate this .
i ' m warning you .
a new pediatric wing at the hospital ? a presidential campaign ? name it . anything .
there ' s nothing we can do .
we can fight . that ' s what we ' re here for : to fight the iraqis . to help the <person> ' ites , and the khurds .
including all the catholic ones ? because that ' s where i went . <person> for catholic boys .
<person> , fine .
oklahoma , thelma . we ' re crossing into new mexico .
i always wanted to see new mexico .
<person> was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence . he ' s gone back there again . <person> has tipped him .
who ?
<person> .
now , you guys hungry ? watch this .
and you think he could find out her number for me ?
he ' ll do better than that . i ' ll send him down to miami on business , you throw him a couple bucks on the side , and he ' ll track her down . <person> thinks about this . dom just let me warn you -- this guy runs a little hot , but he gets the job done .
i ' ve had time to get over it .
you ' re not from around here , are you ?
the owl is a messenger . when one shows itself to a sioux . it means someone ' s gon na die . the owl told him about <person> .
the owl told him about <person> . that ' s incredible . i guess we just broke the back of this investigation , didn ' t we ? evidence doesn ' t get any harder than that -- not for my money . is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court ?
he ' s your brother .
so ?
no way .
it has to be done .
your old friend <person> .
today , you are glad to have the boa on your side . <continued_utterance> in the good old days , the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing . but <person> is supposed to be loading cargo .
cant tell yet . whered you go ?
that smells still fillin this room good .
she threw up in her mask .
. and her heart stopped and she wasn ' t getting oxygen .
why ?
you said i ' d told so many lies , you wouldn ' t believe me even if i did tell the truth . this was the only way to convince you . the truth is that i love you . all that matters is that you believe me .
what ' s wrong ?
nothing , i chickened out .
harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold . it ' s on the sea dolphin ii . and thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - we ' re the only ones who can tie him to the crime .
<person> is my uncle !
well , that ' s true . i don ' t . i think someone else is asking for it .
well , he ' s got good taste . <person> ' t it the most wonderful thing you ever tasted ? i mean ever .
you ' re the fbi . that ' s your job , isn ' t it ? ya know how many of our warrior brothers got killed out here ? i never saw any investigating then . why now ? what ' s going down here ?
a fugitive <person> for a murder suspect . <person> somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine .
what ' s . number one ?
if you want help with your lines , i have two conditions . you have to promise not to fall in love with me .
iandiacute ; ve seen a lot of rings .
<person> , iandiacute ; ll bet you have . <continued_utterance> <person> , where have you been ?
that ' s very unlikely .
why else do you think he ' s putting off meeting you ? although . maybe that ' s not it . maybe .
<person> ? ? we ' ll never catch them . any- way , we ' re all done , <person> . <person> ' s go home .
<person> back here , <person> !
not very original . <person> ' s day .
i didn ' t even think about it .
orchids are my favorite flower .
you know what else children don ' t know ? they don ' t know what a telephone booth is ?
it wasn ' t my truck -- i was helping out a guy in a wheelchair .
uh-huh . where was he ?
you didn ' t fall in love with <person> to be your caddie ?
he was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side . i carried my bag the last four holes . i love ol ' <person> but i need you .
hm ? oh , yeah , i know . what i meant was-
you aren ' t from delaware , are you ?
now that ' s what i like -- an insult with some originality . did you just make that up ? just now ? so clever .
why don ' t you take a long walk off a short pier ?
well . do you not even want me to visit now ? ' <person> i can catch the bus at five o ' clock if that ' s what you want .
well , of course i want you to visit , you idiot ! i ' ve been looking forward to seeing you more than anything ! i ' ve been telling everyone i know that you were coming home ! i cleaned the whole fucking house so it would look nice for you ! i thought you were gon na stay for at least a few days ! it didn ' t occur to me that you were just broke again . i wish you would have just sent me an invoice !
maybe i was wrong about you .
do you hear me ? !
<person> , what are you doing with <person> ' s car ?
i was as sorry as anyone to hear about mr . <person> ' s passing . wished he coulda ' lived to see this !
ah . no one . i give it to <person> when he needs it .
could anyone have gotten it from you ?
at <number> am ?
the wife said she got into a fight with her parents , left asap .
you didn ' t smash my windows in ?
i ' m a hard-working guy . i don ' t go around breaking windows .
i don ' t even know if i should be doing this . it ' s a very expensive car .
it ' s your car . these are all your cars .
' cuz it ' s the only way you can beat <person> . ' cuz you never got over that he is on tour and you are not . ' cuz you get that look on your face .
no . i ' d hit it again because that shot was a defining moment . and when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you . i did not shrink from the challenge . i rose to it .
you ' re the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad .
i ' ve got a new agenda now , it ' s get rich . the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all .
ah . i don ' t believe in writer ' s block .
no kidding .
<person> , if you did something to <person> .
<person> , what do you take me for ? everything ' s fine .
yes ?
hi . we ' re looking for <person> ?
there ' s a responsibility that you ' ve got to have . it ' s a long way from high school , <person> .
i was doing pretty good there for a while . doing pretty good . had my house , had a wife , a cadillac .
<person> sense . you want some more coffee ?
yeah , i ' ll have some .
well , everybody needs a hobby .
no , you got ta understand , valiant , i had nothin ' to do with <person> gettin ' killed . i just wanted to sell my studio . but they wouldn ' t buy my property unless <person> would sell his . and he wouldn ' t . so i was gon na blackmail <person> with pictures of him and the rabbit ' s wife . <continued_utterance> but then it all went to hell . i been around toons all my life . i can ' t sit around and see them all destroyed . <continued_utterance> you got the will in there , don ' t ya ?
where is you would care to go at once , mr . price ?
bang-bang .
call me dr . griswold . <continued_utterance> roy . but at this point i think i ' m more of the ' grip it and rip it ' school . hand me the driver .
<person> it , <person> , don ' t forget to waggle . <person> . the club head . . it ' s a little relaxing ritual .
not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called `` ahab '' . whatever it is , it cost him his life .
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
i ' ll trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying . if you get into the open , well , you ' re on your own .
you ' ll be with <person> .
woody ! <person> !
oh , great , you found them . where were they ?
-you ' re the only woman i know who calls men-
-you ' re the only man i know who doesn ' t call women .
<person> , this is no time to panic .
this is the perfect time to panic ! i ' m lost , <person> is gone , they ' re going to move from their house in two days and it ' s all your fault ! !
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve .
it ' s no my fault i was born first . besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .
ok but if we can ' t find her then the state will have to become your guardian .
who ' s the state ?
what do i do when i ' m around someone i know ?
you use your sleeve . they both smile at each other . <person> . woman <person> ?
the tower .
oh , right , the tower . <person> erection .
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .
i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry i forgot the tent . i don ' t think i forgot anything else .
but <person> . i mean . . how long ?
a couple weeks . that ' s why . that ' s why i had the gun . for protection .
no one ' s going to kill you if [ you do what you ' re told . ] we ' re visiting e . i . o . for some new tests . now get in , or do we start playing rough ?
no ! it ' s not my fault ! you can ' t do it ! <continued_utterance> wait a minute , i remember --
<person> . a romantic and tragic drink .
oh yes , i remember you .
yeah . i know . i ' m with you . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na . i ' m just gon na stop for a little water .
<person> ' t drink up all of yours , ' cause you aren ' t getting any of ours .
i need your help .
we ' re leaving in three hours .
no , they don ' t .
most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive . i realize you ' re very lucky to be alive <person> . the ordeal you ' ve endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department . <person> which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation . scully has her hand in her coat pocket now . moving around the table and approaching <person> . removing
<person> there ?
got work . i know a man who ' s got a boat . wants me to sail it for him .
the girl ' s . <person> ' s .
why the hell would i have her number ? i ' ve never even heard of this chick !
i thought you were the one in her business .
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house -- your house . and you didn ' t even bat an eyelid . she was paying you off . what for ?
yes .
tell me .
so do we .
did you hear that ? he said there ' d been a mistake and they weren ' t going to bother us anymore .
go for it .
it ' s like a to-do list , but for my life . <continued_utterance> if you can ' t imagine the future , you won ' t have one .
they won ' t . that ' s not their jurisdiction .
you sure ?
did they sign ? did they sign ?
<person> ' t worry about it now .
the special is for special occasions . i can not give you the special .
but this is a special occasion . it ' s . <continued_utterance> it ' s her birthday .
well , he better learn to own it . actions have consequences . it ' s not what happens here alice , it ' s what they take away with them .
you ' re still an idealist .
<person> , i ' m sorry . who left who this time ?
i ' m the villain . i thought it could be a little cleaner this time -- me in central america , him in new york .
. if i had your looks , better .
. takes years of genetics , pal , and a yale education . and the right tailor .
nothing . <continued_utterance> what about <person> ? or is this just another one of your stunts ?
no ! he ' s crazy - he ' s insane . he hates everybody . he ' s got these plans - you ' ve got to help me , <person> . i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry for everything . i know i was wrong - but you ' ve got to protect me . i know you still love - bond slaps her . she ' s stunned . he waits . she ' s angered : <continued_utterance> do you feel better now ?
we ' ll tell stories about you around the fire .
not much to tell , is there ? just an average guy who saw his destiny and had the courage to defy a powerful empire . no big deal .
actually , <person> helped me put it together .
he helped you ?
there ' s nothing for them to get .
<person> . so what we ' re going to do is march right to <person> ' s doorstep . we ' re going to insist they take a statement . we ' re going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back . they ' re walking a fine line here . defamation of character , malicious prosecution .
what ? you got ta be kiddin ' . <person> , just go home ' fore you get hurt .
<person> ' t want to kill you but i will if i have to . i ' m warning you .
iandiacute ; m o . k . iandiacute ; m o . k .
sure you are , sport .
<person> into superior ? what for ?
<person> ' t have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
i came on my own . after reading about the bombing in <person> .
well , if you ' ve got something to tell me , you ' ve got as long as it takes me to hail a cab .
he ' s no magician .
he turned that monster into stone !
<person> them ! <continued_utterance> <person> ' em !
<person> it out !
what is it ?
panty hose . work bettern stockins . pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head . you get the pistol . remember , soon as we get inside , you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it . once they notice the ithaca and the smith , theyll know we aint foolin with em .
meth . methodology and <person> .
. of <person> ?
<person> from borrington high ? sounds like a loser .
<person> ? <person> was all-state football and and basketball and valedictorian of his class .
football wasn ' t the kind of life i wanted . for ten years i ' d be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it wasn ' t that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . i ' ve seen way too much of it in my job . i can barely take it when my clients are in pain . i don ' t hate the game . i admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , i was in awe of how he could play it , but i couldn ' t give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it ' s not a thing many people would understand .
you and my mother would have a special connection .
but this is a special occasion . it ' s . <continued_utterance> it ' s her birthday .
a birthday is a special occasion . i will therefore bring the special for everybody .
so that was it ? one bump in the road and you gave up ?
i also called <continued_utterance> they told me they don ' t help out stalkers . <person> , maybe they ' re right , it ' s been a long time .
if you rest the baby on your shoulder , she ' ll stop crying .
<person> up .
yes , you do . you steal from marian ' s purse -- i just can ' t handle you anymore , and it scares me . i don ' t know what to do .
i can be better . i will be . and i hate the way i am anymore ! i don ' t know why i do it ! what about that stenotyping thing you were gon na do ?
i want to call her and tell her im okay . that were okay .
i aint so sure its a great idea , but thats up to you . just dont tell her where we are .
whatever helps you cope .
i guess it ' s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
i don ' t
there were no drugs on that boat . it was a hit . a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser <person> so <person> had a few thieves put to it . men he knew he could march into certain death .
that ' s what i said to my son . he said , there ' s always two kinds . the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands , and then there ' s the real threat . the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind .
are you <person> ' s mother ?
actually , i am blind . <number> - <number> in one eye -- and that ' s the good eye .
i got a blind caddie . just hold the stick , <person> -- and be sure to pull it out .
was it my speech ?
no , the fire . i lost everything .
-after you get the <person> address , get back to the magda-
-is <person> related to this cunt ?
that ' s puttin ' it mildly .
she thinks he ' s a pig .
but <person> won ' t let you .
if i ' m the show ' s vet then it ' s my decision , isn ' t it ?
did you ever play her game artgod ? one word , capital a , capital g ?
i don ' t have a bioport , remember ?
can i ask you something about her ?
she is . ah . here we go .
well -- can you tell me without like , denigrating what i believe in ?
because i think it ' s primitive , ok ? i think it ' s a fairy tale .
then why does she do it ?
we make her do it .
yes , i find that weasles have a special gift for the work . the rabbit didn ' t contact you by any chance , did he ?
why would he contact me ? i just took some lousy pictures .
thanks a pantsful , <person> .
<person> ' t mention it . see ya , <person> .
<person> , i ' ve come to apologize for lt . mcelroy . he overstated the department ' s position .
he accused <person> of taking kickbacks . and you know anybody who knows <person> knows that ' s a goddamn lie !
i do .
<person> do you take <person> to be your beloved husband , to respect , honor and cherish him till death do you part ?
maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him . <continued_utterance> i ' m surprised you didn ' t write one about me .
i ' m still working on it . <continued_utterance> remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidentally started frying kids ' brains ?
how old are you ?
twenty .
yes .
and ? are you going to tell him ?
. see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he couldn ' t play football anymore . if that hadn ' t happened , we wouldn ' t have been together .
how so ?
yes . why are you looking at me like that ?
your train derailed . some kind of malfunction . it took a curve way to fast . a second train collided with yours after it derailed . the debris is spread over one mile . it ' s unbelievable they said . they only found two people alive so far . you and him . <continued_utterance> the man ' s skull was cracked open and most of his left side was crushed . <continued_utterance> and to answer your question , there are two reasons why i ' m looking at you like this . <continued_utterance> one , because it seems , in a few minutes , you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck . and two , because you don ' t have a scratch on you . you didn ' t break one bone .
i don ' t get it . you ' ve never done it before .
no i haven ' t .
an hour and ten minutes .
something has to come out .
i ' d forgotten how exciting it is working together .
you ' ve been so quiet lately , <person> , i thought you no longer cared .
shut up .
you hurt ?
i was protecting my home .

what do you mean ?
it ' s me , don ' t you see . <person> ' s right , i ' m the escape hatch . i disobeyed order .

do you know why you ' re here ?
the conversation , the coffee --
this is not -- shit , mr . <person> . it ' s the truth . i know it ' s very hard for you to accept , but you ' re having a schizophrenic reaction . we can ' t snap you out of the narkadine . you ' re in a world of your own fantasy .
then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it ' s just a dream ?

i don ' t know nothin ' . not about the sphinx . that ' s out of the ball park .
and then what ?
then you ' ll see who ' s really holding on to you .
we ' ve got problems here .
problems ?
stripped of all your weaponry , you still threaten me ?
perhaps you failed to take into account my . hidden assets . <continued_utterance> the name ?
in exchange for what ?
my driving range back .
a word ? i ' m sure by now he ' s engineered a hostile takeover .
you knew him well ?
room service . <continued_utterance> see ? you ' re laughing again . but that ' s what i want . go places and <person> and never look back and just <person> fun . forever . that ' s my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .
you mean <person> ? then why are you with him ?
pup corn ?
that ' s right , `` <person> . `` doggie treats . little snacks for dogs . he ' s figured it out . there is a hole in the market and he ' s going to fill it . spends all out money , works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up . after fifteen months , the big day arrives , the first box of `` <person> '' pops off the belt . he comes running home with that box , pulls us out of school . we all pile into the living room , must be fifty of us , and in comes `` <person> , '' our <number> year old mutt . `` here <person> , '' my dad cries . he ' s got that little fucking pup corn in his hand , `` here girl . `` this dog will eat anything , she eats rocks , anything . she walk ' s up to my dad ' s hand , looks down at the little pellet , licks it once , turns around , walks out of the room . <person> rejected the `` <person> . `` fifteen months of my dad ' s life , right there . not one dog ate <person> . not one . three months later , `` <person> '' shuts down . <person> . my father never got over it . never .
what ' s the difference ?
you only hurt yourself you know ?
i thought it was for <person> .
if the sock fits , wear it .
i ' m -- i ' m not yelling . i ' m just gettin ' a little frustrated here .
<person>:
<person> developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator isn ' t calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream .
simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world .
your concern is enviable .
and besides , i ' m so fat .
zero .
you ' ve always liked your men mean . she looks up at me . feels the shame i shun . <continued_utterance> what would mom and dad say ? <continued_utterance> nothing . that ' s where i learned it .
come on , what were you going to say ?
nah , really , it was moronic .
uh . listen . maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case . so we can find out how she ' s doing ?
oh , yeah , sure , the address . oh shit , i don ' t have it on me .
how could you be ? how could <person> , the world ' s premiere game designer , be on our side ?
something ' s slipped over the edge , here , <person> . something ' s all wrong .
he ' s dealing with a lot of things . i think he needs to find answers himself .
it ' s weird to hear you tell me about <person> . a good weird .
uh-huh . and when we get there , we ' ll be able to find a way to transport you . home .
well , then let ' s climb abroad .
<person> , do you think we should take her to the village council ?
no , no ! they ' ll think it ' s a bad omen . there ' ll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody ' ll blame me for it !
why we setting <person> up as an informant ?
her own people start to suspect her , it creates discord from within . the warriors don ' t know who to trust , they start infighting , and <person> loses his support . <person> nods , impressed . <continued_utterance> her oil pan is shot .
on the contrary , i envy you .
i will miss you all the days of my life .
i ' ll tell him . he deserves to know .
we don ' t owe him anything !
it ' s already been called off . witnesses confirmed you weren ' t the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?
no , but i ' ve confirmed the reelection rally is the target . how much c- <number> is missing ?
i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i don ' t want the archdiocese exposed .
no . <person> , and we ' re going to see that it is not .
<person> . and the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape .
<person> ' t complain . at least you got to shower with a naked woman . what are your plans today ?
i wanted to talk to you about your friend <person> .
he ' s a nice guy , isn ' t he ?
we leave them in the shell .
i don ' t like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it ' s hard to scoop the stuff out . it ' s not good . and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn ' t taste good .
it works ?
swear to god . only good advice he ever gave me . now , go back to sleep . <continued_utterance> you okay now ?
i might . have been . mistaken .
no ! !

ah , now that ' s the real mother- lode in tombstone . up and down <person> , full-blast <number> hours a day , liquor , hostesses , <person> ' , makin ' money hand over fist . all except the oriental . on account of the element . have a man for breakfast in there most days . regular slaughter house . high-rollers won ' t go near it . too bad , nice place .
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime .
i wouldn ' t do it .
they look like a bunch of good ol boys to me . i guess its oil money , huh ?
oil , gas , cattle , farmin . <person> nobody shows off around here . <person> one of the richest in texas .
<person> . show me an honest man .

what reputation ? you ' re nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumbleweed hick .
is that an insult ? are you insulting me .

i mess around with this stuff , but i never thought anything would happen . <continued_utterance> does <person> know ?
<person> is a drug . <person> is a drug .

i don ' t know . she sent me this letter . but it ' s in french .
shall i translate it for you ?
well i do .
well you should .
<person> , of all the laws of <person> , this is one you must not break . <person> looks on , intrigued by the proceedings .
this isn ' t like a journey to earth , where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god . this is <person> .
you can ' t make me .
oh , yes i can .
i teach <person> .
<person> . ok . but the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures . according to these figures , you ' re upside down on your mortgage --
must be so tough raising a kid on your own . although i ' m beginning to get the idea my wife wouldn ' t mind a crack at it .
oh . it ' s just the hormones .
no records since she quit in ' <number> . she quit two weeks after the incident .
thank you .
are you a friend of his or something ?
i ' m his guardian .
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who can ' t stand that his son ' s become more successful than himself .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man ' s wallet .
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it .
you all right ?
<person> ' t even tell me you ' re hot for <person> over there .
<person> ' s a very talented journalist . i see a pulitzer in her future .

what did <person> say ?
he said `` okay , thelma . i just wanted to know you were alright . i hope you ' re havin ' a good time . you sure deserve one after puttin ' up with me all the time . i love you , honey . `` <person> doesn ' t say anything . <continued_utterance> how long before we ' re in goddamn mexico ?
two years , two days , hard to say . if you have any chance , it ' s to stop now-smoking , drinking , gambling , night-life . you must have a healthy diet and most importantly , you must have complete rest-meaning you must attempt to deny your marital impulse .
well , that sounds inviting .
. no . no . no .
<person> bought this beautiful antique <person> .
all right , bubble lover , stand up !
what for ? i just sat down .
he was killed in the war . a year ago . time traveller no ! . it can ' t be . i ' m sorry to hear that . and the gentleman who used to live across the street ? <continued_utterance> oh , him . some inventor who disappeared around the turn of the century . - if you ' re interested in that house , forget it . you can ' t buy it or even go inside .
why is that ?
i ' m listening .
i ' ll keep it in my office room .
<person> ' s probably sitting in the bar laughing at us . <person> way ' s the hotel ?
i don ' t know .
your banishment , the threat of a new war , it was too much for him to bear . <continued_utterance> you mustn ' t blame yourself . i know that you loved him . i tried to tell him so , but he wouldn ' t listen . <continued_utterance> <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> . <continued_utterance> it was cruel to put the hammer within your reach , knowing you could never lift it . <continued_utterance> the burden of the throne has fallen to me now .
can i come home ?
she ' s been dead a year .
who ?
the dope ? it was in the diaper , why ?
oh , thanks a lot . i feel so much better now . here , this is a rabbit for your baby . thanks again , ' bye , i ' m so happy .
i know . <person> reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s . a . c . <person> ' s apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .
how deep does this go ?
<person> , buddy , some buddy ; why didn ' t you tell me to buy bluestar .
<person> , he demanded confidentiality .
<person> , are we cross ?

it ' s okay , <person> . <person> , <person> , the others -- they ' re right . my stories are annoying . they go on and on and on , and the longer they go on the more annoying they become , until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
<person> up , <person> . you ' re annoying . <person> and <person> don ' t know what the fuck they ' re talking about , okay ? the entire class combined- including the lovely <person> about one tenth of one percent the talent you have , okay ?

yes , i am , mother ! those new linen pants you got me from egypt make my ass look just huge .
well , you can ' t keep starving yourself .
yes .
<person> ' t you know how ?
what are you going to do ?
in the road to survival , there is always sacrifice <person> . we are the future . not them . we must protect ourselves . after tonight , when the leaders of the world return home -- they will return as brothers , as mutants . and our cause will be theirs . this is survival , i know you understand that , <person> . or is it <person> ?
cut the language , will ya ?
it ' s gone ! some . malfunction .
any time . are we done ?
not at all .
goddamnit , <person> . this is our butts . so your life is in the toilet . so your wife is banging a used car salesman . sure it ' s humiliating . but be a man here --
you tell on me , i tell on you .
what happened to your hand ?
i cut it on an old rusty knife .
i ' m sorry . but i can ' t tell you what i do not know .
in that case , give my regards to the headsman .

oh , but he will ! he must ! we ' ve come such a long way already .
ohh -- what ' s that ? oh --
we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them .
<person> enough . but <person> ' s on alert and we ' re flying attack planes over their sites , on the deck . there ' s no way for them to know they ' re carrying cameras , not bombs . they ' re going to be shot at , plain and simple . <continued_utterance> i ' m your political advisor , and i ' m giving you political analysis here . this is a setup . the chiefs want to go in . it ' s the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs . they have to go in , and they have to do it right . it ' s that simple .
sure , why not , money ' s the sex of the <number> ' s . i never had it like you when i was growing up , baby , it wasn ' t the upper east side .
you ' re so naive bud , you don ' t even know . your dad took care of you . i might ' ve been rich when i was a kid . but my father lost all his money . in the seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler .
why then .
because it looks good . <continued_utterance> i ' m just not like you . ya know ? i ' m never going to go to yale . i ' m never going to be `` <person> '' .
that ' s right .
all right , i ' ll go in there for <person> -- <person> or no <person> -- guards or no guards -- i ' ll tear ' em apart . i may not come out alive , but i ' m going in there . there ' s only one thing i want you fellows to do .
no longer weak . i now rule <person> , until <person> awakens . perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me .
or perhaps it was the wisest choice i ' ve ever made . i will hear you .
no . time traveller then where does this come from ? <continued_utterance> it grows . it always grows .
but it must be planted , cultivated , nurtured . unless . unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation .
a virus ?
a simple , unstoppable lifeform . what is a virus but a colonizing force that can not be defeated ? living in a cave , underground , until it mutates . and attacks .
<person> is so unattractive .
second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein .
august .
this is <person> . he ' s going to bunk with you a while .
oh no , <person> !

i could never ever be with anyone who doesn ' t take politics as seriously as i do .
why are you doing this ?
i thought you ' d be happy about that . all i ever wanted out of life was two things . to be married and to have a baby . the lord blessed me with <person> and i thank <person> every day for that . <continued_utterance> but having a baby ' s been .
nothing . i just think it ' s unstructured .
well , i ' m sure you ' ll be able to think of something . if you can ' t , i ' ll help you .
what ? no . <continued_utterance> just nervous . i don ' t like travelling .
so you decided to take a holiday on the orient express ?
i don ' t have to listen to this . and you can ' t shove me around . i have friends now . she catches herself , falters .
is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?
maybe , but if you didn ' t i think you would have kept on walking .
you ' re pretty full of yourself , aren ' t you ?
this `` man hiker '' alone or wit someone ?
he had a lady friend , but . i ' m just looking for him now .

<person> is unpredictable .

. well he doesn ' t talk back or steal the silver and <person> ' s gon na get me an exemption on him , aren ' t you .
of course they are !
do you know what it took for most of them to get here ?
dr . <person> , i ' m not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide . i don ' t believe in the elders of zion , the knights templar , the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
i don ' t either , but it sure sells books . <continued_utterance> i was right about <person> . <person> ' t i , <person> ?
which is ?
competence .
we can ' t refuse <person> ' s invitation . it would be impolite .
and what do you say , porthos ?
and it can be relayed beyond comrade <person> ' s ears to the top circles of my government
of course . our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary <person> sees fit to satisfy . <continued_utterance> with the caveat that it is not made public in any way , shape or form . and we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest . i can not stress this point enough .
at least that way things would have been clearer to begin with , y ' see . they wouldn ' t have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib , y ' know ? ' <person> nothing ever comes out of our rib , y ' know ? <person>r . only out of our prick , and even then . <person>rything still has to be done after that .
that ' s for sure .
i always knew there was more . i felt it .
then remember , you are the heir to a billion dollar empire . you have a staff of literally thousands . <person> everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can ' t even wrap your head around everything that is yours . all
that ' s not true .
<person> ' t lie to me !
i can ' t be sure .
you really felt that your crew were up for the conditions .
no i ' m not . have you really looked at me ? i ' m short ! even for a nelwyn ! <continued_utterance> why can ' t you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .
my prsence can not extend beyond this forest . but i can give you these . <continued_utterance> they will protect you . use them wisely .

too bad for her .
nothing ' s happening .
<person> . <continued_utterance> reveal yourself to us . <continued_utterance> who . who are you ?

divorced , actually .
why did we begin this ?
we were idealists .
oh , yeah , pull the other leg , it ' s got bells on it !
and what ' re you gon na tell <person> this weekend ? you gon na say you wouldn ' t join the scouts because . him didn ' t wike his widdle uniform ? <continued_utterance> ' no boy given over to dissipation or negativity can stand the gaff . he quickly tires and gives up . he is the type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment . he can not take punishment and come back smiling . '
three of them . hardly worth talking about . two won ' t bother me again .
and you chased one ?
yeah , yeah . i ' m flying solo now .
what ?
you ' re what ? what the hell have you been doing ?
i don ' t know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i ' m in so far , they ' d kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i ' m like you said , a criminal .
<person> .
what ? ! what about him ? !
you okay ?
i ' <number> be alright .
the village voice is coming .
<person> .
this is totally irrelevant .
oh , but it ' s not . if i hadn ' t been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , i never would have took off for new york . i never would have met <person> , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .
c-calling <number> - <number> - <number> . or trying to .
any luck ?
coming .
<person> .
faster !
can i just ask when lunch is ? the whip lashes out again .
<person> <number> . <number> is no longer bound by his programming .
what does that mean ?
yes ?
do you think polio has affected your husband ' s mind ?
no . <person> ' t do that . <person> ' t deface the property , man . the key ' s in there . <continued_utterance> inside . in the coffee can .
there ' s no coffee can in -- <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> get him .
are you telling me you didn ' t send mary a letter outlining our deal ?
why the fuck would i do that ? i ' d be screwing myself .
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because i don ' t have the money .
then you ain ' t gon na have the car .
what ? what are you talking about ?
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment .
think about it . you walk into a video store and you see <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> since we guarantee you ' ll get every bit as good a work-out .
how do you guarantee that ?
what is it ?
. you should rest .
<person> --
i see him .
never run a company . stay an artist . stay an arms dealer .
oh please . <person> , i can ' t play the violin for you . although . it must be hard controlling all those people ' s lives . <person> at that party is connected to you for survival in some way , it seems . <continued_utterance> ever been married ?
not really . least not so i recall now .
so howd he finally nail you ? right there in the kitchen ?
do you like it here ? i mean , in scottsville ?
yeah . ?
not very christian of you .
i ' m more <person> .
<person> !
<person> ! it ' s coming up !
i remember that deal . you were involved ? gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the housing , his eyes taking in the low-volume news .
<person> is a dish best served cold . well , it ' s payback time , sport . . see that building ? i bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . i sold it a couple of years later and made an $ <number> , <number> dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world . now , it ' s a day ' s pay . i had a mole in <person> ' s employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired .
you ' re kiddin ' ! <person> ! i ' ll be there around two or three .
what kind of stuff do i bring ?
<person> ?
three point five cc ' s .
it ' s not our decision .
i ' ll be killed .
i think . if you get eaten by a bear and there isn ' t a ranger around , i ' m not carrying what ' s left of you down this mountain .
and they say romance is dead . timber falls it is . <continued_utterance> who ' s <person> and/or <person> ?
you ' re nothing but trouble , madmar- tigan . and i got plenty of that . stay in your coffin and rot !
i ' ll be around long after you ' re dead , <person> ! you slime ! when i get outa here i ' ll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !
why not ? <person> says that ' s the only way to do good .
when did you talk to <person> ?
how ' re things ? kids are good ?
they ' re good . <person> ' s getting so big . she looks more like <person> every day .
can i ask you , <person> : do you think your life is important ?
you mean -- like , me personally , my individual life ?
well --
can i ask you , <person> : do you think your life is important ?
want me to carry <person> ?
i ' m used to her . how ' s she doing ?
we ' ve become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . while the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there ' s nothing fake about <person> himself . no scripts . no cue cards . it ' s not always shakespeare but it ' s genuine . that ' s how he can support an entire channel .
a window onto the human condition ?
but .
he ' s gone already ! do it !
who gives you the pictures ?
what ' s this , an interview ? i ain ' t that dumb .
the main problem is , <person> , these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders , non-indians . relations have not been amicable .
different culture . <person> to penetrate . the indians don ' t like white cops poking around . and that ' s why we ' re in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent .
how is <person> ?
great . he ' s revolutionizing the place . no one is allowed to work in his department who doesn ' t have a ph . d . in children ' s literature .
i ' m sorry .
it ' s okay . come over here . i need your help .
what ? it must be a clerical error .
i can ' t believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me . to single me out .
<person> , can you go get <person> for us ?
he left .
we ' re looking for a suspect . we ' ve reason to believe he ' s still in the area .
you have no right to keep us here .
no , my grandparents are dutch , so i was raised on salted licorice and sinterklaas .
how ' s that different from the regular <person> ?
good , ted . <person> back ride ?
i ' m gon na take a rain check .
ohhhh -- yes . yes , sir -- y-yes , your honor . you see , a while back , we were walking down the yellow brick road , and --
quiet !
<person> ' <person> , your father and another musketeer were ambushed and murdered outside the louvre .
this other musketeer -- is he still alive ? i ' d like to talk to him .
the limitless power of .
your will ! your will ! what else could it be ?
you see any damages ? <continued_utterance> see ya ' round .
no , it ' s over now .
when do i get time for me ?
you don ' t . that ' s the point . <continued_utterance> <person> , none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself . some of us remember how your father --
<person> , i just don ' t get it . this guy has cock-blocked at every turn and you ' re taking his side ? ! ?
cock-blocked ? <continued_utterance> we ' ll have to resume this another time , <person> . it ' s been an emotionally exhausting weekend . my parents are in an uproar over <person> . he ' s moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the garage .
why wasn ' t <person> with `em ?
what do you think they were fighting about ? <person> don ' t fancy dope-pushing wetbacks .
wing , i need a bit more than that .
what ' s wrong with your wife ? she doesn ' t work ?
i played in the pro-am with some asshole movie star shot <number> here once . how did a great ball- striker like you , a `legend , ' manage to shoot an <number> ?
i missed a four foot putt on the eighteen for an <number> , that ' s how .
it pushes on my neck . it ' s uncomfortable .
well , when somebody slams into us and you go sailin ' through the windshield , that ' s liable to be uncomfortable too . so put on your seat belt .
i didn ' t sleep with him .
. just so she could cut them off .
<person> ' t you ever wonder about the future ?
there is no future .
<person> .
what can it hurt to talk to someone ? <continued_utterance> please . <continued_utterance> you promised . <continued_utterance> <person> , she ' s been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you weren ' t thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .
read it . out loud . <person> twenty-nine .
i already .
<person> , <person> , this heres the man himself . <person>by , this is <person> and <person> , the most recent strandees , economic variety .
<person>by <person> , just like the country .
hey , look on the bright side --
what ' s that , <person> ? what ' s the bright side ?
<person> , the cracks are starting to show .
i ' ll paper over them .
i am <person> . this is my school .
i was kidnapped . they killed guyrich . mutants . there was a light . a bright . light . <person> turns to <person> , looking deep into his eyes .
i haven ' t asked you yet .
well when you do , that ' s my answer . i ' m sorry . it ' s not up to me .
only when i ' m working . <continued_utterance> <person> shit . are you serious ?
as a heart attack .
no it wasn ' t .
<person> . yes it was . your father ' s name is <person> kolinski . he lives in auburn .
bloody miraculous kind of an horse , be my guess . nothing makes it out of no man ' s land .
<person> horse .
nothing i ' d be doing .
<person> !
<person> ? what you ' re talking about ?
you look at them with the same repulsion and pity as everyone else .
to sneak a few here and there when you can .
i ' ll see .
he ' s from . <person> . my cousin .
we ' ll , them <person> amish sure must be different . our lancaster brethren , they just don ' t have that kind of fight in them .
`` bell out of order . please knock . ``
well , that ' s more like it . now , state your business !
i love <person> . maybe i ' ll come visit you .
i ' d like that .
i felt limited . i felt confined . i felt like i was suffocating .
i see . so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .
my love . is a matter of state . it ' s complicated .
do you think about him all the time ?
we ' re on vacation .
i ' ve got a ton of work and no good people . mcmanus what ' s the job ?
<person> we ' re late .
nonsense . <person> , please .
you sleeping with her ? <continued_utterance> i was cleaning yesterday . i found this . <continued_utterance> scuba dive . touch a moon rock . <person> to read egyptian hieroglyphs . go to college ? she talking to you ' bout this stuff ? <continued_utterance> <person> , some of this is . farfetched . you take after me . people skills and common sense .
i could take after dad , too .
<person> lay odds ?
you would lose . you must excuse me .
maybe i can get down there next week .
<person> always acts like a gambler who is in the biggest game of his life and don ' t know about playing cards .
you don ' t really show a great deal of exuberance .
<person> , for me . i ' m a parade .
oh , you ' re the best friends anybody ever had ! and it ' s funny , but i feel as if i ' ve known you all the time . but i couldn ' t have , could i ?
i don ' t see how . you weren ' t around when i was stuffed and sewn together , were you ?
oh god , <person> .
one bad car accident .
<person> ' t worry about the loans . i ' m doing good <person> and it ' s gon na stay that way now . least buy yourself a new suit .
what do i need a fancy suit for . i don ' t hobnob with the jet set . i just fix their planes .
she only worked here a month . nice
what happened to her ?
i think so . . what about you ?
me ? sure . why ?
you have such a pretty , long neck , like a swan .
<person> had a long , smooth white neck . it was like on a statue it was so white ?
i ' m gon na take a shower .
no . we ' re going for a drive .
that ' s not exactly what i meant by constructive , <person> .
i think <person> should try to be more
yeah well fuck you ! you just can ' t stand the fact that it was my turn .
your turn ?
can i tell you something ?
of course .
how ' d you manage that one ?
friend . baseball bat .
his name ' s d ' <person> , <person> .
<person> , d ' <person> .
musketeers !
musketeers in my house ! gentlemen , put away your swords and come in . anyone who fights the cardinal is welcome here .
oh , god .
god , the mechanic .
oh just fine .
you haven ' t seen <person> around , have you ? i ' m looking for her .
where are you going to be sent , sir ?
well , i ' m not sure yet . i ' ve always been a combat officer , but i got an idea they ' re going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me . they ' d better not . they just better not . i ' m not ready for pitching horseshoes yet . now nothing to the women folk about this !
i don ' t know !
. maybe . maybe we can fight our way out .
will you wear this ? <continued_utterance> will you at least see how it fits ?
<person> . it ' s beautiful !
i know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
i mean your pictorial . it bothers me , profoundly .
-give the man a prize . he ' d also rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn ' t convict . now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip .
<person> . <continued_utterance> loaded him into a car-
not even a rhinoceros ?
imposserous !
dr . <person> ' s taking all his .
no , no , no . i have to talk to him . if i can only call him .
if i may , i ' d like to come back for more of your `` coffee . ``
any time . <continued_utterance> she could do worse .
you haven ' t been given an assignment in this case .
i was the one who brought that money in .
we were on our way to a benefit . but , as luck would have it , the club was on the way , so . we were able to put in an appearance .
otherwise we would ' ve been here earlier .
is that all you ever want ?
hello ?
if he ' s not here , he has a reason , because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body . i can ' t expect you to know anything about a person like that . you ' ve nothing but a suit .
that is my cue . <person> night .
yeah . they got my license as well .
<person> to hear it .
it ' s perfectly natural for a patient to bond with his analyst . it ' s a normal part of therapy . if you want to be rid of him , simply take him back where you got him and go home .
that ' s easy for you to say ! he ' s human crazy glue ! if it were that simple do you think i ' d be here ?
should be dead as well . your failure today is astonishing . it is a disgrace . <continued_utterance> do you know why the color is blue at the wick ? <person> starts to sweat . <continued_utterance> because that is where the flame is the hottest . <continued_utterance> the temperature is close to five hundred degrees .
the plane . it ' s all been arranged .
were you with <person> ? or are you two still fighting ?
no , and yes . i don ' t know what i ' m going to do about <person> . i know he is seeing someone else and that ' s okay with me , and he thinks i ' m seeing someone else and that ' s not okay with him .
but you didn ' t . why not ?
i don ' t know . i guess . i wanted to see what would happen .
yes , but <person> ' s still a boy . he could be a great king . <continued_utterance> . if we only had more time .
for once , our son needs something we can not provide .
to figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her , that ' s why .
do you look on top or bottom ?
. we have <number> . <number> million invested . at this point , we ' re up <number> . <number> million and some change . if it goes to <number> bucks we can clean close to <number> mill .
you ' re walking between the raindrops kid . i expect <person> is choking on his royal chamber pot by now .
so i see celery , i see the lettuce , tomatoes , cauliflower . and i think , all these things come out of the ground . they just grow out of the ground . they had corn -- out of the ground . radish -- out of the ground . you say to yourself , how can all these things come out of the ground ? you know what i ' m talking about ? all these things are out of the ground .
<person> .
a ghost ?
did you ?
i ' m as underprivileged as they are --
the fact that you attend this school makes you privileged . <continued_utterance> finally , i ' d like you to join the drama club . rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings .
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they can ' t see . i can ' t see nuthin ' , so it ' s all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it ' s all the same to me .
so , we ' re all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
they will suffice .
you ' re welcome . now tell me . <continued_utterance> what were you doing , in that ?
stop pretending you ' re not a pig for all this , <person> .
i still got a day job , pete-
what ?
go fuck yourself .
no .
yes .
got a couple of cups of coffee at hap ' s from her . that ' s it . by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman ? i could ask you the same question .
no you couldn ' t .
well , how do you know i even ate any ?
i counted them . you hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon .
there ' s enough business for us all .
i mean , we ' re fine .
you ' re pathetic .
what did you say ?
we don ' t have a whole lotta choice , do we ? i can ' t figure out if they ' re real smart or just really , really lucky .
it don ' t matter . <person> will only get you so far and luck always runs out .
that ' s right . i do .
back then i had intricate systems with women you wouldn ' t believe .
you ' re a very stubborn man , mr . <person> . <person> pig-headed . boys , show mr . <person> how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station .
no . you bastards ! leggo of me !
the two in alaska . just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? still tinkering with <person> ?
what do you want with him ? <person> smiles now , tapping his metal helmet .
what if i do ? <continued_utterance> what if i do ? <continued_utterance> you talk loud , and don ' t even have a big stick to back it up with .
something happens to me i let go of this grenade . i go , and i take the navicom with me . and how do you suppose you ' re going to find your way back to the hummer , when you won ' t even know what ' s up or down . it ' s a big country , and you could be heading for the allies , or wandering right into bhagdad . that ' s if you don ' t die of thirst before you even get that far . how you like my stick now ?
you got <person> . let her go .
<person> , listen . you have to come with me .
what are you guys talking about ? what narcs ? what gang ? and who ' s that fucking baby ?
for your information , the ' fucking ' baby ' s name is <person> . and if i were you , i ' d watch what i said about her . because she just so happens to be your daughter !
how ' s that ?
standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding .
that ' s great , <person> . and i ' m learning how to listen to the tuning fork , throw caution to the wind , and take crazy risks i never thought were possible .
c ' mon , <person> , when did you ever take a crazy risk ?
come on now . we don ' t want any trouble in here . not in any language .
evidently mr . <person> ' s an educated man . now i really hate him .
he takes other people ' s clothes ?
it ' s the depression , cornell . where have you been ? oh right - cornell . <continued_utterance> here , use <person> ' s second bucket for now . <continued_utterance> you barely use up one .
it doesn ' t matter . i love him .
he doesn ' t deserve it .
i just wanted the kid to see you --
well , now he saw me . now you saw me . ok ? now would you mind ?
ok , well , that ' s gon na be pretty nice for you , because i write a pretty <person> interesting letter .
<person> , we ' ll see .
<person> down . i can ' t make heads or tails of what you ' re saying .
he ' s coming . he ' s right behind me .
let me have one of those cigars . <person> nice in here . you run it ?
<person> , owner-operator .
<person> -- yeah -- good . but it might be better if we don ' t mention the `` accident '' to anyone . <person> might get the wrong idea . <person> ?
oh , yeah , people could so easily misinterpret that .
you okay , honey ?
that womans laugh creeps me out . i heard somethin like that . somewhere before . <person> like the wicked witch .
i like it .
<person> , whoa , whoa .
well , <person> , you could check your bioport-plugs .
the what ? the sparkplugs ?
we ' ll see . if it doesn ' t , what the hell , at least i gave it a shot .
that ' s right . and the good thing is you can do it anywhere .
mr . <person> , please .
business hours are over , <person> . this is the switch .
how bad did mac get you ? we figured pretty bad .
i ' m fine . i ' m going to live a long time . that ' s what i called to tell you .
<person> , nora . i . um . i . er . lied to you the other day .
how so ?
that is not true , mrs . <person> . your route is compromised . perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california .
i don ' t think you ' re going to do that .
my wife died .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that .
heh , heh . oh yeah , uh , i .
remember , i ' m just a couple of blocks away . <person> is left lovestruck .
it ' s the new <person> theme song . we thought this would be a good way to launch it . everybody who plays existenz is going to be very familiar with that tune .
<person> .
this pizda ? never seen him before .
who you workin ' for ? what do you do for a living , dickhead ?
it ' s probably raccoons which is what it was last week .
you stay here and monitor the radio . let me know right away , if you hear from hawk .
that ' s a sad story . do you think you could ask <person> something for me ?
proceed .
what ? like human sacrifice ?
no ! like the wheel , for instance ! that ' s pretty awesome -- the way it just goes around in a circle . and farming ! and metal -- writing , money , pottery -- hot baths . come on ! back in the village we thought sharpening a stick was a big breakthrough .
this town ain ' t big enough for the two of us !
what ? !
i ' m reading all the novels on mr . <person> ' s best american authors list .
how many books are there ?
i said , you ' re not really here . neither am i . we ' re both in the memory studio -- in the offices of <person> , <person> . on earth .
are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some . artificially injected fantasy ?
i just don ' t see it . you ' re skinny , you got a big nose , and you squint .
who ? me ?
get off my property .
i ' m not on your property !
i ' m confident they will learn to love me . after all , i ' m practically family .
<person> , you must dismiss this thanksgiving notion from your mind . i remain firm on this issue . <person> .
my name ' s <person> . i ' m a private investigator .
a what ?
sir ! no sir !
<person> , thank you . at ease . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> ?

you musta seen him . he hangs out with <person> , cheese . you know , that group .
what obscene words ?
' fuck you . '
and so he ' s penalized for not turning away people who couldn ' t afford his help ? he was a doctor .
yes , i know , he was a very good man but in banking terms , in the reality of what makes this world actually function , he was an irresponsible man . i ' m sorry , but you oughta to know the truth . this depression is going to last for a long while .
yes . <person> ?
what ?
i know my rights . these are international waters . the british navy abandoned that boat , and i ' m claiming it . under international law , i have the right to salvage what ' s on that wreck .
fifteen seconds . perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney .
no , i ' m just making myself busy .
well , i wouldn ' t do that . <person> don ' t like nobody looking at the files .
the nanny .
<person> ? <person> ran off with <person> ? that ' s incredibly ironic .
oh . we ' re picking her up . <person> .
<person> . well then , shall we ?
all right .
are you over at dr . <person> ' ?
and they can ' t fly around out there forever .
so we wait .
<person> , i ' ve known this day was coming for a long time . i ' ve got your father and the garden and the new house . you really don ' t have to worry . <continued_utterance> really .

i ' m trying to make him a man but you keep babying him .
you ' re going to find yourself on the floor .
what ' s wrong ?
about every ninety seconds , the auto- pilot jogs us to the west . <continued_utterance> then re-sets us to the north .

as below , so above . you hold the univers , <person> , in your hand .
you ever dated a guy who actually believes in soul mates ?

his spiritual mother .
to us indians , our spiritual relatives are as close as family . i ' ve got seven mothers on this reservation . sisters . brothers . you ain ' t one of them .
how do you know about it ?
<person> worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time . he treated them so well that they ' re virtually all completely loyal . none of them would cooperate . we ' ve questioned the ones we could find , and the only thing we learned is that <person> apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery .
<person> .
<person> , right . well , good night .
me neither .
no great loss --
who are you ?
i don ' t know how to drive .
oh , right . <person> , that ' s true . he used to rub ail kinds of things on it . <person> . ground lamb .

<person> ? !
<person> .

i don ' t get it .
you saw the experiment this afternoon , didn ' t you ?
i saw a toy machine vanish . but i ' m certain there are a number of ways of doing that trick . any magician at the hippodrome could probably do it . time traveller it was no trick ! - would you care to see the full-scale model ? <continued_utterance> no , i would not ! i have no desire to tempt the laws of providence and i don ' t think you should . it ' s not for man to trifle with .
it sounds wild . so now you ' re a big hero , right ? for fixing their system .
uh huh .
you don ' t know that .
you don ' t know he isn ' t .
and what happens when you can ' t ?
new king .
oh , <person> . i ' ve missed you -
is this another one of your games ?
oh , what guests there are in the other hotels . they ' re pretty bored here without snow , and a new york show ' s kind of a novelty in vermont .
i would think so . how will they know you ' re here ?
it must have been enforcing <person> ' s last command .
you ' re a talented liar , brother .
the lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart , the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me . it all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast . <continued_utterance> did you mean it , <person>ie ?
how would you like it if i read your journal ?
<person> , <person> . <person> your meeting ?
in the darkest moments , it ' s what i live for . especially since i ' ve heard how much you like to watch . on the hidden camera .
forget it . you were always a front runner . you never had any interest in underdogs . but i was your son .
you are my son .
<person> . i got the sack today .
what sack ?

so what ' s your angle ?
before the bomb went off ?
that ' s what i ' m saying .
i ' m just thinking , you know , if the rest of the boys knew what we ' re doing . i mean if they knew what we were coming back with .
you can ' t tell anybody about this .
what does that mean ?
the three unions . it ' s <number> % of <person> ' s operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ <number> an hour , that ' s the real hidden value g . g . , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ <number> - <number> an hour a run , this airline is gon na be the hottest thing since <person> .
you ' re welcome .
ok , uh . oh yes . one minor note here . <person> ' s birthday party ' s been moved to today . next we have -- the toys all panic .
i ' ll make a call .
i love my coach !
you don ' t ever listen to me .
this time ' ll be different . i promise .
you ' re kidding ?
take a look at this , <person> .
<person> , dad . <person> has come to represent all that <person> hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in . he ' s what you ' d call clinically bummed .
why can ' t we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little london broil ? i mean , for god ' s sake , we own a grocery store !

i blew his back out with a buffalo gun , that ' s how i know ! now you ' re gon na say i didn ' t , so you can throw me back in solitary ?
the men who came to see you at leavenworth . the one ' s who made the arrangement . who were they ? maybe i can talk to them .
forget it . you can ' t prove it . <person> ' s testimony is no good . <person> knows we win she gets the cash .
i ' ve got my dr . <person> , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains .
i am very serious , <person> . there is no time to lose . now she intensifies her light so that <person> backs away , completely covering his face .
but i ' ve got a family to think about ! they need me ! <continued_utterance> hello . ?
you ' ll be id a foul bood -- jet lag really wipes out you dow .
<person> mean , now ?

who found me ?
i did . i got there at eleven like you said , right as two black and white ' s pulled up : you were out cold in a gutter `round the block . <person> knock you out ?
-- but he didn ' t do anything to you . and you can not promise a little boy that you ' re gon na --
. i just , you know , after all that religious conversation , i just realized it ' s probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesn ' t believe his life is important in the scheme of things --
got me . <person> ' . <person> ' . i <person> ' t know .
i read this book , book on spiritualism .
you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing . it ' s all my responsibility . so i ' ll tell you what <person> , you stay off of my bridge , and i ' ll stay out of your galley . we ' ll get along that way .
fucking bastard .
aw shoot . my cell battery ' s dying . <continued_utterance> <person> , i must have left the charger in the other car . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> you want me to pick up something for you while i ' m here ? <continued_utterance> no . i ' m just . i mean i ' m . oh nothing .
your phone ' s breaking up <person> . i ' m not joking when i say it ' s packed over here .
it ' s too big a spread .

i believe you , mr . mcmanus . i quite sincerely do . you would not have been chosen if you were not so capable , but i can not make this decision . whatever you can threaten me with is . ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if
just past <person> .
<person> ?
you can ' t be serious ?
why not miracle waters ? i ' ve drunk the oil of monkey glands , been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses . after all that , this sounds downright peaceful .
<person> .
you ' re always taking his side .
i ' ve got to work around the clock to keep this place .
so you ' re really a dancer , huh ?
does everybody know what happened ?
yes .
uh . new mexico ?
you dare threaten <person> with so puny
what is it ?
it ' s an observation and repair rig . travels along the pipe , checks for broken seals . but it ' s not supposed to be there .
i know why . to bring you here -- to this place -- to me .
i couldn ' t agree more . i ' m trying to agree more , but i can ' t . that ' s how much i agree .
-- or was she too prejudiced and mr . <person> too proud ? i can never remember . it wasn ' t personal --
-- it was business . what is that supposed to mean ? i am so sick of that . all it means is it ' s not personal to you , but it ' s personal to me , it ' s personal to a lot of people . what ' s wrong with personal anyway ?
seems like an awful lot of extra paperwork .
i like paperwork .
then what do you think he was trying to do .

let ' s just say i ' m freelancing and leave it at that .
<person> ! i knew it ! you ' re a vic- tim , <person> . <person> , you and me : victims of a rotten , corrupt , cor- rupt , rotten world . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> my friend . i ' m really a good man . give me my freedom , and i ' ll look after that baby for you . trust me . <continued_utterance> that ' s it -- good -- good -- like that , yes , good , good , the chain -- that ' s it , come on -- come on -- !

something like that .
but the white dot in the middle ; that ' s got to mean something .
you mean , with your wife leaving you and ail ? <person> mentioned something about it . about a note .
yes . well . it ' s complicated , <person> . i think we should go now .
a facial prosthetic .
the aesthetic replacement does work . emotionally , and actually .

a ride . you want one ?
well , i ' m glad you did . and i ' m sorry . why don ' t you tell me about it .
what did you do to your neck ?
please . getting past him should be simple enough now , since he seems to be letting <person> sneak by under his nose .
forgive him ! he meaneth no offense !
i ' m not looking to just survive . <continued_utterance> that if you make an enemy of <person> <person> , i won ' t be there to stand by you .
you really mean that ? what ' d he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without <person> ' s money and seal of approval , i ' m not such a hot investment anymore . you ' re just the best money can buy , <person> .
like what ?
i don ' t know .
get off me !
if there ' s one thing i can ' t abide , it ' s rudeness .
yes , and that was very generous of you , but the night is young .
so what is <person> , the fucking condom faerie ! ? !
' bout eighty kilos southwest .
that far ? <continued_utterance> you catch anything he was saying ?

<person> .
<person> has him at ten to one . they ' re sure he ' s gon na self-destruct .

<person> . <person> . i ' ll bet there ' s . <person> at this .
four .
no . <continued_utterance> no , no , no , no no . you need to go now .
you insist on calling all the shots . and by the way : i am not a helpless girl .
aim that way . <person> starts to shoot as -
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
of the six prison inmates you ' ve tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only mr . <person> is still breathing .
<person> . <person> over at the drugstore thought you might have some work i could do .
things aint real hot right now . <person> , there though , is about to relocate in about a week to san angelo . i might could use a man when he does . you good with engines ?
come on .
i don ' t know . i was just wondering about my work and all . i mean , what is it i do exactly ? all i really do is run a bookstore --

<person> , uh , i ' ve been thinking about everything you told me .

it ' s a small price to pay .
i . i can ' t , <person> .
i don ' t understand .
there isn ' t much time . just listen . everybody ' s pretending <person> . everybody but <continued_utterance> everywhere,
i can explain that --
silence !
but you ' re strong <person> . so much
he ' s in love with a girl who ' s dead . it _is_ dangerous for you to have it . i ' m sorry .
you don ' t have to . the rabbit ' s wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink andamp ; <person> . you can catch her in action there .
the job ' s gon na cost you a hundred bucks .
what happened to your hair ?
nothing . it got messed up .
well . ah .

<person> robber .
oh , great .

you see , if i was god , and i could create the world all over again , here ' s what i would do : i would create <person> from <person> ' s rib , not the other way around .
really ? <continued_utterance> that ' s an interesting idea . actually , i just wanted to ask you .
what kind of stuff do i bring ?
i don ' t know . warm stuff , i guess . it ' s the mountains . i guess it gets cold at night . i ' m just gon na bring everything .
honestly , <person> . it ' s like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire .
rules are rules .
shoot .
boy or girl ?
<person> . <person> ' t be gross .
<person> . at any rate , i ' ll let you go . we ' ll have plenty of time to settle this tomorrow .
i ' m the one ' s got the big stick .

a couple of hours .
well , get to it .
will it work with an industry standard bioport ?
i haven ' t seen you two before , have i ? this is my place .
<person> , right , it ' s a game system .
and we ' re worried that it ' s too intellectual , too complex , too weird , too artsy . that argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans . she hates to be rejected in the flesh , so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat .
<person> , <person> . this is me , <person> , you ' re talking to . we both know you don ' t have shit , never have had shit , never will have shit . <continued_utterance> here , <person> . i want you : o look this over . know what it is ? <person> deposited his check , transferred the funds to an offshore bank , a numbered account . not even the cops can find out whose names are on it . think one of them ' s yours ? <continued_utterance> he also put a down on some island property , and a lease-to-buy on a forty-foot sailboat . you ' re into sailing , aren ' t you , <person> ?
get away from me .
do you have time to eat .
i ' ll eat there .
you ' ve got an awful lot of orders in you . always giving orders .
i out rank you , that ' s why .
maybe we shouldn ' t make it .
if you ' re worried about anything , let ' s take that blood test of yours .
it wasn ' t a lie .
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it .
what should we do ?
this child must be taken beyond the boundaries of our village . all the way to the daikini crossroads .
well , you can imagine how much sleep i ' ve gotten .
<person> , of course , ' cause after the <number> : <number> bottle it starts all over again around nine .
what ' s this ? you ' re gon na try to scare me now ?
do you know the reason why i try to recruit guys like you ? there ' s no risk . <continued_utterance> there ' s nobody back home who ' s gon na ask questions if you just . disappear for a while .
<person> ! i didn ' t betray you . i love you !
kill them ! !
but <person> .
it was <person> , <person> . i mean the devil himself . how do you shoot the devil in the back ?

<person> we were bad , we were very , very bad .
that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you ' ve been over-tenderizing your meat , again .
<person> ? did you see that ?

- but as i ' ve explained to <person> , without proof , there ' s just no story . <person> ' t you agree mr . <person> ?
cannon fuse .

right now i wouldn ' t be surprised if <person> showed up singing send in the clowns .
he ' ll be okay now , <person> . he just --
no ! i want him out of here ! <continued_utterance> go on , beat it .
why did the chinese waiter have to die ?
a waiter hears many things spoken when people are relaxed and eating . a waiter has many opportunities for betrayal .
<person> mentioned .

maybe we can stop there for lunch .
whatever you ' d like .
it was a flawed installation - my first . it . it neural-surged .

the way <person> dances , and he ' s funny . it ' s easy to see yourself married to him .
he ' s undoubtedly been detained . that ' s all .

i ' m not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello .
i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day . that ' s different .
i can ' t believe it . i saw <person> .

<person> there , <person> . what do you want us to do ?

<person> .
i want you to know . i don ' t know . i just think you ' re a hell of a guy .
because it ' s not true .
well i ' m glad your done lying now , just in time to lose your practice . that ' s how we survive , <person> . your family . you ever think of that ?
we gon na let rock-a-bye fight too-
-relax <person> .
say what ? honestly , sugar , you can talk more shit sometimes ?
got you a pack of mores again , huh ?
the only difference between a psychopath and a genius , mr . <person> , is the degree of success . <continued_utterance> still , i do miss her . i only wish she could have lived to see all this .
i can feel your pain .
that ' s just it . i think i <continued_utterance> sometimes i think it ' s in my head , sometimes i think it ' s for real .
<person> , we ' ve known each other since before we could get a hard-on . <person> half-smiles at the ribald remark . <continued_utterance> the only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other ' s test papers . <person> , they were identical . i always liked that , because whatever the answer was , we was
because i ' m the mother , and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life ' til you ' re eighteen . seriously , we ' ve got no money . i can ' t buy you the moccasins .

where ' s the love gone , <person> ?
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder .
go up there and take a look .
<person> !
clearing everyone out ! it ' s been rumored for months .
wow . i can see why i was willing to betray e . i . o .
how long ?
she didn ' t cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .
you work for the commission , is that it ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t the commission have enough information ? they got to send out guys like you to spy ?
well , we just started out , and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions , it would give us a lot of credibility in the community .
i out rank you , that ' s why .
in the service you do , but we ' re not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we ' re doing , that doesn ' t particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
you ' ll lose him anyway . i ' m sorry .
then you have to put him down .
four is pretty good ?
no , four is . four is . just hold me .

oh , but <person> , she hit him over the --
<person> .
what number ? <continued_utterance> dildoes .
it ' s a crime .
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime .
ahhh . your quest . chingaso .
this is where i stand up for all the little guys everywhere who ' ve had their fill of soulless robots like <person> --
<person> , well , we ' re not .
we got to get out of here . <person> says anything . this really scares <person> . <continued_utterance> we have to go back .
and the jacket ?
over there . in the backseat of the .
. preferably <person> .
nice guy but a loser . lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of <number> . you wan na be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching ? . <person> happened to that cute analyst at thudder , <person> ? .
it beats ' what ' s your major ? '
right . <person> , i was wondering if i could borrow your car . <person> ' s sort of out of commission .
maybe . maybe not .
what do you think those are for ?
pretty . she ' s a blond .
do you have any idea who she is ?
<person> ' s boy , <person> , to start with . the <person> ' s <person> was another one .

<person> , it is . in fact i ' m doing great . new client . <person> new league . it ' s starting to happen <person> . the big leagues ! you know what i ' m saying .
sure . lots of guys at the track talk like that . but how do you know you ' ll have any dough next month . what ' s this ? i gave you two hundred .
what ?
she ' s disappeared . and two of our men have been killed .
that ' s what they get for not locking the door .
so i ' m standing there and you could hear a pin drop . no breathing or snoring . suddenly it hits me that somethin ' was goin ' on that just stopped , really fast , like people are holding their breath .
you ' re mocking me , aren ' t you ?
oh , no , no , no . <person> , look ! an alien !
<person> , please . <person> ' t you see how much i love you ?
i see you . i see you too clearly . always have . i have to admit that was a nice touch when you got back from the speakeasy . being with me in our bed , after being with him . covering your tracks . i should have known a whore only performs for a man like that when she wants something .
you mean have your house as the ' after ' and find another house that looks like your house for the ' before ' ?
is it possible ?
it ' s <person> . i forgot <person> . <continued_utterance> my fish .
oh . right .
you ' re interested in judy , aren ' t you ?
that ' s it , eh ? unless it belongs to someone else , a girl doesn ' t - ouch !
see that ? they ' re doing it now ! they try it every time we hold still .
<person> , we ' re only going nine miles . be there in two hours , tops !
it fell out because a loan couldn ' t be arranged , but the people did agree in principle . the point that we ' d like to stress , is that you misled these people . told them the job was free . then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown , and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars . that is misleading and deceptive sales practice .
it was temporary insanity . i don ' t know . it just came over me . it might have been something i ate . i don ' t know . it was crazy , i ' m the first to admit it was a crazy thing to do . believe me .
what the hell do you want me to do ? !
stop .
no , i ' m holding for <person> . in chairs . <person> . <person> .
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of <number> million dollars .
you guys going to let him give orders ? i mean he could be one of those things .
i don ' t know about <person> . but i didn ' t go near that plasma . but i guess you ' ll all rest easier if someone else is in charge . <continued_utterance> can ' t see anyone objecting to you , norris .
who did you break up with ?
patricia . you met her .
no . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to kill him , <person> . <continued_utterance> the closer i get to this guy , the more i . it gets to me . i don ' t know .
i think you ' d better go on home , <person> . you ' ve fallen in .

some of them have to be automatics .
your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . `` like a woman , purring with ecstasy . ``
no , no , no ! you got it all wrong , <person> . <person> is fine ! <person> is right here . he ' s with me !
you are a liar !
not often , but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they don ' t know how long the shadow really is . they don ' t know how far away the real limits are standing . they stop out of fear . <continued_utterance> this is kind of strange isn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> we ' re not even acting like ourselves . <continued_utterance> like that . your mouth ' s dirty . you tapped your napkin to your lips . you only do that when you ' re with someone you don ' t know .
what do i do when i ' m around someone i know ?
oh . how can i help ?
um . er . well , the problem is . like . is like . eh , you know . you ' re the problem .
his mother ?
yeah , i guess he still lives with her . <person> like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence .
you murdering dog !
no , it ' s not what you think , i swear !
what do you mean ?
he ' s been beyond the reach . to the edge of the abyss and back . he ' ll do well by us all <person> . he ' s a real salt . there ' s no malice in him and there ' s nothing more dear to him than his boys . so sleep well my friend .
whats that , peanut ?
one person thinks hes doin somethin good and everbody else gets upset about it .
he dropped <person> off first ?
yeah .
last week ? i thought she just arrived two days ago . <continued_utterance> how long have you been here ?
she wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father .
you mean blow up ? like you always do ? and <person> moves to the tee .
do me a favor . bet me a buck i don ' t put it in the fairway .
huh ?
this town ain ' t big enough for the two of us !
<person> . thank you .
i said when can <person> be taken to ceremony ?
how ' s it with you , <person> ?
<person> started out bad . couple of bikers from out of town tried to knock over <person> ' s grocery store this morning . it was a real shootout .
senior class fund-raising gig . i told ' em they could hose down the jeep . hey , come on . it ' s for a good cause .
sam the philanthropist . <person> , right ?
nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .
oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it .
he ' ll remember <person> ? the sphinx project ?
fragments . nothing more . nothing he could piece together . i did advise terminating him , rather than implanting an identify alternative .
yes .
where ? . in the leg ?
<person> says hello . he told me you weren ' t feeling well .
how is <person> ?
you got a good memory , franky .
i had a good teacher . mclean versus <person> .
how was it contracted ?
that i don ' t know . but if it ' s through simple contact of blood to blood , and if it doesn ' t respond to conventional treatments , it could be a serious health threat .
i ' m sorry . filby will you answer me one question honestly ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll try .
why this preoccupation with <person> ? time traveller why not ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t go simple on me , <person> ! time traveller if you want to know the truth , i don ' t much care for the time i was born into . - it seems people aren ' t dying fast enough these days . they call upon science to invent new , more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth . <continued_utterance> i quite agree with you . but here we are and we have to make the best of it .
what is your problem ?
you ' re not in a very good mood .
<person> for my parents , the tent , the band , the judge .
i think i forgot the tent .
what ?
i ' m thinking about taking a trip .
oh , <person> !
i take it back you don ' t act like <person> , you act like <person> .
so you found <person> , huh ? that ' s awesome . <person> kept calling for him , but he wasn ' t around . i guess <person> was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks . who knew ? <continued_utterance> so , you gon na ask about her , or you just gon na sit there all sober ?
i know .
i hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that i then have to wear like last year .
it was disgusting ?
and you have to meet my father .
fathers love me .
no . what do you want ?
i just wanted to say how sorry i was about the match and if i did anything to cause it then i will never forgive myself . i know how much wrestling means to you , baby .
you mean , like an architect or something ?
architect , yeah . <continued_utterance> no , it ' s not the money . <person> , yeah , that ' s good , but it ' s the freedom i ' m talking about . <person> , this guy has to have a job he could do anywhere . that way we could just up and leave at the drop of a hat .
about <person> ?
actually , i was wondering if i might ask you about <person> .
who wrote science fiction .
the precursor of science fact .
but , <person> .
<person> .
let them out there read my mind .
i wish you well , <person> .
i want to get back in the cage .
you ' re serious ?
but -- what happens if i -- - cs -- glinda speaks to dorothy o . s . in f . g . --
just follow the yellow brick road .
screw regulations ! four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there !
so , i don ' t want to end up crawling around with them when we go down .
where am i ?
you ' re in my home , <person> . you gave me quite a scare . i thought i lost you . <continued_utterance> lucky the snap didn ' t break the bone , just bruised it . i know that ' s of little comfort now , but trust me , it ' s a good thing . that dirty trap however ' s prime for spreading infection , need to finish cleaning out that wound and then i ' ll get some `` evening primrose '' in you . <person> stuff the indian <person> used it back in the day to heal , well . just about everything . so ' s do i . <continued_utterance> <person> and relax .
how is my dog ?
excellent . he should be coming out of the oven right about now .
they ? you mean head office ?
i mean anybody . <continued_utterance> i heard what <person> said to you . he said , `` we have enemies in our own house . `` he said it as he was dying .
he ' s a really sweet kid . our girls love him .
that ' s nice . <continued_utterance> i am so sorry about this . it ' s just been such a difficult time .
where . is . she .

so whose car is it ?
. oh , did that hurt ?
no -- it feels wonderful . i ' ve held that axe up for ages . oh -- -
what kind of life is it to be hidden away ? i know you believe that what you are suggesting for franklin is best . but i think you are making it harder for him .
i think i know what ' s best for franklin . i am his mother !
do you think that ' s why i ' ve been having these . . spells ?
how long have you been having them ?
but <person> had . <person> was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .
i don ' t
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they ' ll believe me . i ' ve been lying for so long , one more time won ' t hurt .

how ' s your marriage ?
i hope so . <person> , mckenna about your wife : if i had known she was married --
it wouldn ' t have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you ' re a man without scruples .

since i was five . my mom ' s a cocktail waitress .
how do you -- the two of you -- get by ?
sure you could , in wildwood , new jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you wouldn ' t have much left over for decoration .
<person> , i thought <person> was a tough businessman , but somebody ' s really taking him to the cleaners here .
i will not fight him .
then it ' ll be easy to kick your ass . <person> stands , steps between the two men .

have you come across <person> ?
not likely .
i ' ll demonstrate . please . <person> beside me . <continued_utterance> ' <person> i compare thee to a summer ' s day ? thou art more lovely and more temperate : rough winds do shake the darling buds of may , and summer ' s leash hath all too short a date ; sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines , and often is his gold complexion dimmed ; and every fair from fair sometimes declines , by chance , or nature ' s changing course untrimmed ; but thy eternal summer shall not fade .
. does this do anything ?
depends what number you write . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
<person> , haven ' t you heard ? <person> ' s been arrested .

you sonofabitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ?
there was no time . <person> is too smart for that ; he would have spotted the agent a mile away .
he didn ' t spot me .
<person> .
what ?
ray . stop calling . i told you the dental records will take time .
what about the blood ?
. and is that serious ?
i ' ve got to work .
<person> ! that ' s why the court exists . the court doesn ' t exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice .
and are they going to get it ?
cooper . <person> cooper . oh you know , whatever pays best . little bartending , used to teach tennis , played a little competition . .
i never played tennis . you just travel around <person> -- no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .
<person> . <person> ! i ' m gon na stop for a second .
no !
how is that possible ?
tax dollars only cover that much .
<person> , just go to hell !
<person> .
what for ?
so i can make you a list of the things we need .
i should risk coming right over the top and snap-hooking it out of bounds left .
yes !
<person> , ' cause i liked what i saw .
nice place .
had to do what i had to do .
you say you get a million , you get the million . some cop gives us shit , he ' s dead . <person> , man , you ' re hard-core !
dr . <person> left the restaurant about forty minutes ago .
forty minutes ?
you can certainly tell how old you are , my dear .
you know the saying , `` your heart is in your left hand . ``
er , yes . no , no i ' m not .
closed session .
what okay ?
what !
come on .
where ?
i forgot my books at school .
<person> .
mr . <person>s got an appliance shop .
but i am also with the government .
oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ?
oh -- well , about a year ago -- i was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain . <continued_utterance> . and right in the middle of a chop , i . i rusted solid . and i ' ve been that way ever since .
you sure ? you never . to class or anything ? because i could swear i-
never .
cut the horseshit , guys . so . the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow , so i figure there ' s gon na be a big ol ' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog ' s gon na tiptoe around it and walk on home . i was right . you owe me twelve thousand dollars .
we going to pay you .
<person> ' t worry about me . i can take it .
i ' m not worried about you . i ' m worried about the safe .
<person> to the water . <person> to the owl . he also said , don ' t trust the fucking <person> .
go back to your dna finger-printin ' .
he was your contact at the trout farm . a damn good man . his dog brought me this .
but we were contacted there by <person> . he seemed to know exactly who we were .
take my friends where they want to go !
yes , sir .
you think the girls are in trouble ?
they will likely notify their parents . perhaps even expel them .
it hasn ' t changed . it ' s died .
so then there ' s more talk about the wind . while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous . and when you finally get back , you have to clean up the boat .
i ' m sorry , frank .
i really loved that pizza too . `` <person> '' if you ' re ever in rosemont .
upstairs . resting . i can ' t understand why he ' d attack you like that .
i can ' t either . but one thing i ' ve learned about psychiatrists : they ' re brilliant manipulators . i trust your dad completely . i ' m sure everything he ' s done has been to help me . how come you aren ' t making a move on <person> ?
i ' m just trying to understand your thinking . you were in the same spot on eighteen yesterday without a headwind and you --
you don ' t think i can knock it on from there ?
no , no , no . you were great .
<person> is everything .
i wasn ' t in the corps .
then you ain ' t no brother to me . my brother was in the corps .
that ' s good . it means the circulation ' s coming back .
<person> , but i mean really burn .
i ' ll look like a fool .
what you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up <person> ' ass , eh ? do what i say or i quit .
congratulations .
what about you ? <continued_utterance> it ' s a ninety-one ! it ' s an ' a ' !
i ' m afraid he might have broken something else , <person> .
it ' s certainly possible , <person> .
hey , brody , lonnie . <person> this out . <continued_utterance> looks like we got ourselves a little party .
we were just moving our way up the mountain .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
that ' s right . and guess who ' s the new king of the unemployment line .
y ' all have a nice day . drive safe .
see how polite he is ? he was really nice .
no .
what makes you so sure it was one ?
<person> whoa whoa ! hold a grudge much ? that was like a fortnight ago .
that was way less than a fortnight .
<person> will kill him later .
who ' s <person> ?
<person> ! please . <person> ' t walk away from me .
like you walked away from us ?
that ' s just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
let me guess : retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof !
forget it , <person> .
let him talk to me , he makes <person> look good , i print it , the british public likes it , <person> owes you .
i ' m still working on it . <continued_utterance> remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidentally started frying kids ' brains ?
i ' ve been in prison , remember ?
i was a little worried . i mean --
oh , i been a lotta different places . um . i went down to florida for a while . i was doing some work in orlando . i ' ve been all over the place .

you want me to stay , boss ?
i need to be alone .
because it looks good . <continued_utterance> i ' m just not like you . ya know ? i ' m never going to go to yale . i ' m never going to be `` <person> '' .
<person> says you have to be like me .
i thought you were dead .
keep your mind on the mission , d ' <person> .
but this is the border .
you saw what those animals did at that rancho . you think a border is going to stop me ? no , i ' m going to see them suffer for what they did ! i swear it on my soul !
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
hey , take it easy . i ' m just a dude trying to make a buck .

the coast guard ' <person> ' . she never lost a race while you were <person> .
<person> , come on , leave <person> alone .
piggyback ride .

madmartigan . <person> ' s go . <person> ' s get <person> .
if you say that , then i say you don ' t know second lieutenant <person> very well , do you ?
<person> ! i don ' t believe i ' m doing this . i don ' t .
there ' s wind up there .
i know .
what was that , admiral ?
we ' ve been hailing the groznyy for the last hour , mr . secretary . the groznyy refuses to stop .

i ' m sorry . ?
i ' d be honored .

i was only going to the mall for some christmas wrapping paper .
<person> happens .
you don ' t think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
we check out the area and wait for a time when it ' s clear .
i know . <continued_utterance> but if she fucks tip our friendship - she can go to hell . i won ' t allow it ! we are bros .
i feel the same way .
if i have to listen to <person> ' s singing voice one more time , i ' ll fall on my own sword !
well , now i ' m on board . she and thor share a grin . <continued_utterance> where are they ?
did you have any indication of this from georgi ? any possible warning or sense of motivation ?
complete snowjob . and then we went out and told the country they weren ' t putting missiles into cuba . by the way , you realize we just lost the midterms .
i ' ll bring them to you .
you ' re not leaving here <person> .
i put you on the floor .
oh .

plunging straight for him .

yes .
well , you may have a point . <person> ' s continue . time is not our friend .
what ' s with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you ' re `` extreme '' ? i ' ve got some news for you , mr . x , you ' re a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x ' s on your head .
i ' ll take that under advisement . maybe i can be like you and lose a leg for the old stars and <person> . i bet the flag ' s a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs .
that doesn ' t explain how he managed to tear through our security .
steroids . he ' s a bit of a fitness nut . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> a .
no -
the queen invited you to dinner -
<person> . if you work with <person> you learn that right away .
<person> , i ' ve heard a lot about this .
i ' m a brilliant businessman . it ' s what i do best . what ' s your business ?

you ' re gon na fuck me over , aren ' t you ?
hold still , <person> ! <continued_utterance> ha-ha ! !
you did it ! next stop . <person> .
some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water . but that theory is speculative at best .
it was the visit to that god damned <person> !
why did you forget the tent check ?
i didn ' t mean to liz . i ' m sorry .
likewise .
well , your mother seems very nice , though your father i think might be rather dim .
<person> for you to say .
what ' s that supposed to mean ? !
<person> so i can understand .
if i don ' t adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving , he won ' t be able to walk when i take him out of

she did . but that ' s not for me anymore , <person> .
you were supposed to buy a plow horse .
you bought him ?
<person> ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight ?
heh , heh . oh yeah , uh , i .
maybe i ' m missing the point here , but if he paid twenty-four hundred , which is the cost of the job , i can ' t see anything wrong with that . i don ' t know the guy , but i don ' t quite get the problem .
what we ' re getting at here . what we ' re trying to stress , is that the job was sold under false terms . the man didn ' t win any award . he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price . a clear case of deception was involved here .
stop teasing .
timing is everything . he waited until you were primed . until you knew there was no other man you could ever love .
hell no , i can ' t do that myself . i ' m blind . <person> ' t you see that ?
i ' m sorry , i didn ' t --
i don ' t want to !
you think i do ? ! <person> . i ' m just as freaked by what ' s happening as you . but we have to deal with it , `cause like it or not , it is happening .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man ' s plans . we all got plans . i planned on seeing all my life . i know you didn ' t plan on straying into town .
the interview with <person> .
i ' m having some art brought up from the city . the cottage should look spectacular .
when was the last time you used it ?
a day or so ago . i guess .
bring this man a change of good clothes . has he eaten ?
i don ' t know , sir .
no he ' s not , dad . he just appears tall because you are on the floor .
i can feel the floor pushing against me . can you feel it too , tall youth ?
<person> , like it ' s so hard to build a new hut . it ' s just a pile of sticks and dung --
you ' re a pile of sticks and dung .
so then tell her you changed your mind . no one can question that .
i can ' t , <person> .
. <person> problem ?
captain <person> ' s ferry was late . he runs the line across the strait between here and <person> . the lumber mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus . <person> on the docks . hundreds of them .
you are not carrying me inside .
<person> on .
<person> , no . i ' m putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it -- cuss me now , thank me later .
<person> , won ' t you at least make him let me have the shoes for gym ? how can i play basketball without gym shoes ? i ' m the only one who -- <continued_utterance> it ' s not the shoes , is it ? or the candy . it ' s me , isn ' t it ? you just can ' t stand the fact of me .
i will .
never run from a fight .
amazing .
maybe i just needed the moment to present itself .
<person> won ' t let you fall , he ' ll be there . all the arrangements have been made , boss . it ' ll be fine .
who are we fooling ? this will never work . they ' ll never let me back into politics . they ' ll never see past my legs .
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone ?
i could shoot your cousin <person> .
through , through his book .
what book is that ?
those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant . they were executed at close range . that one there is a police officer killed by the mohawks up in canada more recently .
<person> .
<person> somebody get the damn dog out-
remember about the light you ' re supposed to see when you ' re dyin ' ?
i ' m talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . it ' s gon na take me two years and <number> headaches to turn <person> around , what do i need this dink airline for ? i ' m up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake .

you ' re welcome . now tell me . <continued_utterance> what were you doing , in that ?
what does anyone do in the bifrost ?
some cigars . case of beer .
thereandiacute ; s no smoking or drinking on the school grounds .
the white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler . that ' s why they wear them .
think the iraqi ' s killed them all ?
your what ?
i mean , where are our real bodies ? are they all right ? are they hungry ? what if there ' s danger ?
<person> ' t they even tell you the pediatrician ' s name ?
no . they didn ' t .
he ' s probably on drugs .
i know .
all i can tell you is . i ' m on a mission for the king .
i ' ve heard that one before .
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i don ' t even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you ' re coming back . or if you ' re coming back .
we ' ll get through this , i promise . i ' ll make it up to you --
you ?
take a look at the second row . insert close up on the screen .
. and what did he say . ?
. <person> , you aren ' t allowed to be in here .
i saw him .
who ' d you see ? <continued_utterance> who ' d you see , <person> ? the man on the floor ?
he may be a soulless robot but he ' s a rich , happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who ' s got you by the huevos -- besides , how is getting into the u . s . open gon na change what she thinks about you ?
it ' ll prove to her that i ' m not who she thinks i am .
<person> , for god ' s sake talk sense .
<person> and <person> !
nothing , it ' s just that , , well , it ' s been awhile since arsonist ' s <person> , and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were .
washed up ?
kinda looks like you .
`` terminator '' climbing claws . <continued_utterance> miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .
in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt .
yes .
the huguenot rebellion , occupation in the antilles and <person> . the coming war with france . these are not the usual hobbies of youth .
no .
why ?
to make sure she ' s all right .
never .
and she was a little more than pissed about it .
stands about so . <person> hair . <person> kind of banged up . was in an accident .
oh , yeah ? i was just with that guy , not more ' n an hour ago . <person> bad . <person> , huh ?
so . maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations .
we thought maybe you ' d have that kind of information for us .
<person> ' s get it down right . the guy broke into your house , you hit him in the head with a gun , went to the refrigerator , took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him .
i was defending myself . he was stealing from me .
<person> , but what ?
soft stuff . i guess .
no , <person> . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of <person> , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess ' s life .
me ?
what ?
you said to leave it , remember ? we walked home .
i will . i promise . as soon as i stop being terrified . <continued_utterance> i ' m so tired .

<person> , it ' s <person> . i missed my audition . i lost my head . <person> , i have to go . i ' m with <person> .
i was in an accident once too . a horse almost trampled me to death .
wow .
judge <person> , yeah . if it wasn ' t for her i ' d probably be out of business already . i just need more .
is there anything else you can do for money ?
well -- <person> -- i realize that scottsville is not exactly a major banking center .
no it ' s not .
what is it ?
it attacks the nervous system . people suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities , sometimes one , sometimes a whole string of them . they can ' t control it .
i think i made the wrong one .

n-no .
so that this man can verify to the world that <person> is now a nuclear power .
maybe more .

i really do think the country done changed just a little while i was away , peanut .
you got to keep an eye on it . thats sure .
and this adversely affects me how . ?
<person> ' t you see ? -- <person> lied to us about
<person> , business . <person> to be rid of you . you ' re not in the girly mood .
what do you know about girls ? you wouldn ' t know what to do with a girl if she fell on you !
i ' d like to tell you . but i can ' t .
' important business . ' <continued_utterance> i understand . men make bold plans in secret . and women wait . to mourn , or to celebrate the outcome . i know from experience , it ' s a lonely vigil .
i ' m sure he did . and where is your young partner this day ?
working his first big job .
<person> got what counts .
not for long . <continued_utterance> we ' ll join the column . bring them with us .
i hear you .

can you come over ?
i can ' t . i really have a lot of work to do .
i ' m just an m . d .
do you know dr . <person> . ?
<person> only has two moods : busy . and asleep .
then you better do something to jumpstart that man ' s motor . you know . wake up the sleeping giant of his passion .
oh sure , he figured it was easier to die of thirst ? come on , sombody must ' ve chased him up there .
oh , you mean somebody who ain ' t scared of a twelve gauge shotgun . and then what did they do ? camp out down below and just wait for him to die ?
i really did miss your mind while i was out at pee dee , honey . the rest of you , too , of course . but the way your head works is gods own private mystery . what was it you was thinkin ?
well , i was thinkin about smokin actually . my mama smokes <person> now , used to be she smoked <person> ? i stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade . when i got old enough to buy my own , i bought those . <person> just about settled on mores , as you probably noticed ? they're longer .
sure , my name is <person> . why ?
<person> , <person> , i ' ve seen many beautiful women in my life but i swear to you , i ' ve never , ever met a woman as exquisite as you are . <continued_utterance> <person> , can you feel my heart ? it ' s pounding . this is horrible , i think i ' m gon na faint . <person> : i ' m madly in love with you , i ' m single and here ' s my phone number . <continued_utterance> i ' m putting my fate in your hands . if you don ' t call me , you ' ll make me the most miserable man on earth . this is no line and i ' m not trying to get you into bed . this is something completely different . i love you <person> and if you call me i ' ll be the happiest man in the entire universe -- this is ' love at first sight . ' out of all these beautiful women i noticed only you , and .
yes . perhaps they will .
maybe we should have killed an
a little shaky . sore wrists . bruised heel . <person> says she ' ll be fine . did you catch the bull ?
she ' s in the menagerie .
catch him , you fool !
he got away ! he got away !
tell me .
well , first you pick your place , see , then i ' d just sit back and watch it for awhile . <person> got ta wait for just the right moment , which is something you know instinctively , that can ' t be taught . then i ' d waltz on in . <continued_utterance> and i ' d say , `` alright , ladies and gentlemen , let ' s see who ' ll win the prize for keepin ' their cool . <person> says everybody lie down on the floor . if nobody loses their head , then nobody loses their head . you sir . you do the honors . just empty that cash into this bag and you ' ll have an amazing story to tell all your friends . if not , you ' ll have a tag on your toe . you decide . `` then i ' d split . <person> .
how come <person> let ' s you work here ?
<person> and i are united in holy matrimony .
i miss them , too .
you can ' t come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .
i think maybe we ' re missing the point . it
<person> put , <person> . and a good note to end on , i think . <person> ' t forget about wordfest this weekend . and remember : those of you driving v . i . p . s to tonight ' s cocktail party need to have them at the chancellor ' s house no later than <number> : <number> . <person> green gathers her things , pauses by <person> . <continued_utterance> thanks for that . he all right ?
you ' re disturbed .
yes ! i believe i am !
i thought he knew him , <person> . i can ' t believe he doesn ' t know him .
he seems to be indicating that he doesn ' t know him .
we ' ve been digging . we ' ve been digging for hours . if there was anything here to find we would have found it .
get up off your ass and dig !
what ' s that ?
take the binoculars .
they ' re magic ? are you serious ?
i am very serious , <person> . there is no time to lose . now she intensifies her light so that <person> backs away , completely covering his face .
but this is the emblem of the musketeers .
the musketeers no longer exist . or haven ' t you heard ? throw it on the fire .
<person> , a `` white squall '' . with all due respect captain <person> , they ' re only boys .
they are much more than that , sir .
well , <continued_utterance> what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet . i was up for going to <person> . i was getting excited .
in the past year i must ' ve said a hundred times `` we got ta get out of perfection . we got ta better ourselves . `` you gon na stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i ' m the reason we ' re still here ? you want to know how close i am to going to <person> right
the city ' s full of bad microwaves , bad thermals , bad electro-optics . you can ' t shield from it anymore . you can ' t get true readings . the whole industry moved out of the city years ago .
so you know your way around . we can hide out .
the worst serial killer in history - who ? <person> - right ? killed forty two people . our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day .
<person> , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
-- you saw this experiment ?
what did it look like ? <continued_utterance> there were bees . and corn crops . <continued_utterance> what are they ?
<person> up !
they say that if somebody ' s holding a gun on you , you should never stop talking . that ' s the theory -- who knows ? . <continued_utterance> maybe it ' s a good thing that i talk too much .
who ? . <person> ? .
yeah . the one that introduced <person> to you and <person> .
you know how that <person> is . thinks every man he sees is after his <person> .
more like <person> is after every man she sees . flo you pay <person> no mind . he just likes to show off for his girl . give him a couple of hours , he ' ll cool off . still want that beer ? bobby i ' ll take it to go .
what ' s that ?
<person> left his passport in curacao .
well , <person> told me you used to drive for <person> and santos .
so ?
<person> ? ?
she left me . <person> .

you lack honor . you lack compassion . you lack honesty . you lack humanity .
<person> . maybe some of that is true --
i ' ll never forget his <person> .
i ' ll tell you something , if mr . <person> wants to play . we ' ll play .
he -- <person> . <person> -- it ' s <person> .
something to do with <person> , is what i ' m getting .
i know it . he ' s winning . i do act like him . i feel like him sometimes . i ' ve got ta get out of this place or i ' m a dead one .
i know , but you ' ve said that for two years .
his elbows could be in splints -- so he can ' t really dial --
or he could be in the hospital in one of those semi-private room with like --
me too .
<person> is the jersey shore .
what were we doing officer ? why didn ' t we help her ? well . we ' re all a bit high , you know , bachelor party , that kind of thing . <person> here is getting married in three days . <person> wife . he didn ' t have anything at all to do with it . it was all <person> here . just <person> .
you don ' t play games with homicide police . there are no options here . there is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle .
if you can ' t do the time , don ' t do the crime ?
oh . i almost forgot . there is one last thing : before <person> retired , he asked that i give you one other protective device .
what ? never ! i ' d rather be a subway conductor .
then dump her in an orphanage , ' cause there ' s no way we ' re gon na take care of her all by ourselves anymore !
i don ' t know .
<person> --
<person> ? apple ? yogurt ? you like yogurt .
i used to like yogurt .
enough ! <continued_utterance> is it true ?
good cop . bad cop .
when can i see you again ?
you can ' t , it ' s too risky . i ' m not much help anyway , remember ?
you okay ?
yeah . but i ' ll tell you , if you ever wanted proof god is a man , this is it .
you ' ve been living here since you were nine ? i should look into that . how do you get to be a eunuch ?
they cut off your testicles .
your guppy .
oh . thanks . <continued_utterance> thank you .
i heard of a d ' <person> once . he was a captain in the musketeers when we were just recruits .
he was my father .
i told you , i ' m off it . i ' m coming up on a thousand days .
c ' mon , just one drink .
none . he believes that man should honor no kings before god .
a man of faith . how delightful . whatever you ' re paying him , double it . i want the king ' s birthday to be a memorable event . and rehang this painting in my chamber . just as it is .
mr . president ! we ' re receiving reports that the ships are stopping !
<person> , belay that order ! <person> , where ' s that coming from !
what are you going to use ?
jimmy needles .
<person> . the ex-evidence teacher . his `excellent ratings ' didn ' t stop him from stealing the magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation .
why would he investigate me ?
the later events have never been kept a secret .
where am i ? and how can i leave ?
gee , i don ' t know , <person> . <person> . you ' re good at that .
i ' m sorry , <person> .
you do have a fat face .
not my face , my brain . it ' s enormous . i ' m the smartest guy in the village .
i told him about beating off once with her brassiere .
what did you tell him that for ?
why won ' t you go away ! i disgraced myself on national television ! no one will buy my book ! my family ' s going to hate me !
dr . m . , your family loves you .
i hope that shrew at the front desk gave you shit about it .
i ' ll go in the morning . the car ' ll be fixed .
i ' m not .
or searing acid !
nobody would believe us . we ' d still get in trouble . we ' d still have our lives ruined . and you know what else ?
what ?
<person> ' t matter . i like change . you know , constant turnover . as soon as i close the deal , it ' s one of two more times , then adios .
<person> ' em and lose ' em .
he didn ' t do anything . he just told me his theory . it ' s sad when patients get like that . they loose reality . david <person> what the hell are you doing ?
-<person> did you load that gun ? <person> nods , `` yes . `` crying harder now . jeremy -you won ' t get hurt . <continued_utterance> -<person> was wrong .
nothing .
nothing ? nothing in particular you think we should know ?
i know . pirates from sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships .
sometimes kill the crew ; other times - torture them .
- we all want what we can ' t have ?
not all of us , <number> .
would you please .
i ' m serious .
thank you .
who ' s that , your father ? grace stepfather . bobby got a boyfriend ?
you ' ve got the wrong idea about me . i ' a a pawn in this just like poor <person> . <person> you help me find him ? i ' ll pay you anything .
<person> , i ' ll bet you would . you got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .
what is it ?
ah , yeah , hi . is tina there ?
<person> , take <person> in the backyard . take a bowl so you can pick some strawberries . <person> will enjoy it . <continued_utterance> you shouldn ' t talk about the boy ' s father in front of him . this is family business and we have to pull together .
whether the boy hears it or not , the man is still a jackass . everyone should have some mother wit .
you do now . what about you ? what ' s your nickname ?
<person> .
what ' s your marketing strategy ? how do you plan to return us to profitability ?
why don ' t i give <person> an opportunity to answer that .
why can ' t you come .
no ! <person> . <person> , <person> , i ' m counting on you . you calm her down . i mean do whatever you have to , whatever it takes .
i knew him . he would never -
he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to . <person> has been
yes , it is . so what do we do ?
we let him stay . i don ' t know , do we even have a choice ?
i don ' t get upset .
then can ' t we just talk ?
cows . you know , cows ?
i ' ve seen pictures .
well , if you don ' t mind me sayin ' so , he sounds like a real asshole .
it ' s okay . he is an asshole . most of the time i just let it slide .
this wasn ' t my idea , you know .
of course not . you were just chosen again . maybe after you and the princess get together you can start thinking about someone beside yourself . she walks off before he can answer .
what do you mean ?
her face had a sour look . that means we ' re going to have trouble with the local authorities . they are not going to be receptive to the fbi .
thanks , <person> . i . uh . i love you .
i love you too , you little brat .
if you had to do it again , would you still go for the green on eighteen ?
yeah . and i ' ll go for it tomorrow and i ' ll go for it sunday , cuz i didn ' t come here to play for no second .
you aren ' t from delaware , are you ?
well , see , it ' s kind of complicated-
what do you call it ?
i do what i ' m told .
<person> is dead !
what if he ' s not ?
yes .
. and he ' s making a billion dollars every minute working for <person> , <person> , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr . <person> , he tried to fix a case .
no , honey . i told him i was buyin ' a car . what is it for ?

<person> . slayer of <person> . y ' got stones showing up this far south .
what happened to your face ?
i dont particularly care for that kind of talk , <person> .
hey . i never said you was a pussy . always figured you had the big ol round balls for this kinda thing . sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good .
those aren ' t mine .
they came from your car .
<person> . you wan na eat through a tube , be my guest .
now you ' re gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . now i ' m gon na take the whole foot off . <person> think of that ? <continued_utterance> what ' s that , eh ? i thought you didn ' t have no friends !
i had just been left by <person> . i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason , it made me feel better that your life wasn ' t as perfect as it seemed . <continued_utterance> by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , <person> called from the hospital and it was too late .
<person> late ? jody , it was an accident .
in here !
<person> , guys . what the hell ' s khruschev thinking ?
what does that mean ?
like if something happened to him , he could still get us .
and i ' m afraid . oh god , i ' m so afraid of .
what ? what are you afraid of ?
<person> ? she ' s not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn ' t like to be alone .
and it doesn ' t cramp your style ?
i ' m a lifesaver . a lighthouse . up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . i stay lit for you . i stay lit . i don ' t go dark . i never go dark !
you need help .
no , i found him , he raised him -
when i heard about the miracle horse , i traveled three days because i knew whose horse it was . my granddaughter ' s . she saved his life ! he was everything to her .
no sexual confusion there , eh , <person> ?
shut up and drink .
maybe . <person> is . not me .
right . and why is she here ? if he killed her , why doesn ' t she haunt him ?
i ' m very proud of him . he ' s been through a lot in his life . a lot of ups and downs , a lot of bad spells . a couple i ' d thought had broken him . i mean emotionally . they were bad . but he made it . yes he did .
he ' s kind of a miracle .
a friend . of <person> .
yes .
then maybe i ' d be . open to that .
<person> after this . test ?
i ' m not that good . and i don ' t want to be .
<person> ' t say that .
it ' s ' menage ' . and it ' s not . we all have lots of girlfriends , thank you .
uh-huh , so what ' s your friend do ?
well , you ' re perfect now .
my . my neck . my . my neck . <person> ? oh -- bang on my chest if you think i ' m perfect . go ahead -- bang on it !
she ' s . she ' s not here . she ' ll be back soon .
oh here , this just came for you . they just dropped it off . can i hold her for a second ?
one person thinks hes doin somethin good and everbody else gets upset about it .
aint it the way .
well , theres a good side as well as a bad side to it . the good side is i knew your daddy , and i thought <person> was a good ol guy .
you knew my daddy ?
you ' re trying to trick me .
<person> , then tell me this -- who ' s standing right behind you ?
that ' s your problem . make arrangements , a deal ' s a deal .
got it .
there ' s nothing to tell .
then call <person> about this dead <person> . i ' m no legal mind like you , but i ' ll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick . collect the rest of your money .
he is ?
sure . <person> growing up with a dad who sees every stage of growing up as a freudian passage . did you ever have crayons ?
i knew i ' d like you .
why ' d you point at me that day ?
when ' s she out of here ?
<person> .
i can ' t stay .
i know . <continued_utterance> i need to ask you something . and i need you to tell me the truth . <continued_utterance> who is it ? who is trying to kill me ?
if you could just sign right there .
you want it in writing ?
hey , <person> , what were you in for ?
reckless driving . do you believe that ?
no . i also wanted to say that i ' ll do whatever you think is best for <person> . i promise .
then leave him here . where he is .
i think it ' s more complicated than that .
on the contrary , it ' could be just the ticket .
that ' s right . you just act like one .
those aren ' t mine .
<person> , well i don ' t have them all .
you ' ve been using me --
who ' s dead ?
the prostitute .
you black ?
no .
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs .
what little dogs ?
what ?
seance .
doing the bachelor party thing ?
that ' s right .
they ' re in a hurry to grow up . they don ' t know about consequences or responsibility . that ' s being sixteen too . i promise you one thing .
what ' s that ?
your thoughts on the matter interest me . they might . help .
it seems to me that . you ' re doing very well on your own .
hyggelig a mote dem . jeg heter <person> palmer .

my mind says `` yes yes '' but my body says `` no no '' . it ' s hopeless .
if i ' m not hopeless , nothing ' s hopeless . <continued_utterance> let ' s try something i saw in a pirate movie .
hi , <person> , i just came back to get a file i forgot . <continued_utterance> everything okay ?
yeah , okay .
<person> , baby , i <continued_utterance> you don ' t have any money put away , do you ?
jake never gives me more ' n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he don ' t want me goin ' anywhere .
getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time . someone who , at the very least , could monitor our progress . make us legitimate .
and that costs more money .
there came into egypt a pharaoh who did not know .
i beg your pardon . is that a proverb ?
there ' s something i didn ' t have time to tell you before .

<person> , <person> .

so he ' s got ta do something , right ? let him wrestle . <person> at this way , you ' re helping out the old man and this kid ' s a little bonus for doing the right thing .
he busted <person> ' s face in with a shotgun . left him a mess of blood and teeth . nearly killed him . you spot anyone you don ' t know , you be sure to find me .
<person> . <continued_utterance> he ' s gone . <person> and those boys are a pain in the backside . i ' m sure that cousin of his had it coming .

you ' re sick .
and if you think you can fuck me , don ' t . cause i ' m fucking insulated <person> . protected . backed up on floppy . do you get me ? i want my fucking money !
we owe him that ! he got you started in this business . he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures . before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like price ! he took care of you before you were hot ! silence . she ' s hitting home but he doesn ' t want to acknowledge it .
he wouldn ' t understand .
just a car .
it ' s not just a car . it ' s a sixty-four and half <person> convertible . that ' s the difference between you and me , and why you live here and i ' m just passing through . <continued_utterance> now do you mind ? i got to get some stuff out of the trunk .
hear what ?
that it was all an accident . she wants to here it from <person> ' s mouth .
i ' m sitting on a two shot lead with three to go , and my partner ' s in his pocket . suddenly , par ' s a good number . gim me the seven iron .
no way . you ' re going for the green . these fans paid good money to see golf shots they can ' t hit , not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit . <continued_utterance> thirteen years on tour and you ' re still a pussy . hit the fucking one iron , <person> .
i want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me . all you ' ve ever known is duty . to me and to a political career that unless i can walk no longer exists . you ' ve been exemplary . now i ' m telling you you ' re free to go .
no . i don ' t want freedom . i want a marriage . i want a life with you .
i think the big dog ate something .
did the tuning fork ring in your loin ?
he lives in you .
and your father ?
itandiacute ; s alright . itandiacute ; s alright .
the two in alaska . just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? still tinkering with <person> ?
his . his wife ? ! ?
there , there , <person> ' am . it ' s going to be okay .
you make babies --
-- but why ? what ' s the point ?
i am not going to let go until you ' re ready , okay ? trust me and put your hands out like i showed you .
i ' m not ready ! do you hear ? i ' m not ready ! ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! child molester .
i wanted to get some of the salad .
it ' s out of order . go around .
<person> ' t believe me -- see if i care .
all a . <number> bullet would do is make a hole in his head .
why else would they approach us in this way ? it ' s deniable . the soviets have done nothing but lie to us . this could be more of the same .
that may be why <person> ' s introducing this guy . we ' ve been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .
do you ? <continued_utterance> what about the uranium ?
it ' s on the boat . he ' s holding a press conference tomorrow . <continued_utterance> i ' m so sorry , <person> . i promise , i ' ll never leave you again .
i ' m going to win this case . <person> . mr . <person> . i ' m going to the jury with a solid case , a famous doctor as an expert witness , and i ' m going to win eight hundred thousand dollars .
you guys , you guys , you ' re all the same . the doctors at the hospital , you . it ' s ' what i ' m going to do for you ' ; but you screw up it ' s ' we did the best that we could . i ' m dreadfully sorry . ' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives .
well , he don ' t talk to me about it .
he don ' t talk about it because he can ' t . there aren ' t words for some things . come here . <continued_utterance> the mice ' ve been at it . <person> down .
ah . how did they treat you ?
i don ' t know what you mean .
no , wait , i ' ll go with you . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry , <person> . god , i ' m so sorry .
that ' s all right , <person> . <person> ' t worry .
oh , we know , we know : the bride won ' t argue . the bride won ' t raise her voice .
well , i ' ll tell you what the bride will do : the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the bride ' s son . now does the bride ' s son want his face slapped ?
no . i didn ' t want to tell him till after .
<person> . <continued_utterance> nothing ' s going to happen to you .
no . my horse can .
that ' ll do .
youre gon na have to kill me to keep me away from <person> .
oh , dont worry bout that .
i ' m hardly newsworthy these days . how did he find out i ' m here ?
small town -- word gets out . it probably won ' t amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the inn . <continued_utterance> all right , i know the gentleman . i ' m doing him a favor . you know , i used to be a journalist .
<person> .
<person> ?
<person> ' t we turn away ?
you can ' t run from the wind son . you trim your sails , face the music and let the chips fall . <person> , let ' s close her up , dog , tight .
no , next to him !
he ' s just a kid !
<person> ' t that a little politically incorrect ?
the hell with that . no one ' s gon na tell me who i can and can ' t work with .
donandiacute ; t listen to her . itandiacute ; s a trap . <person> turns .
what is ?
i just want to get married .
exactly ! exactly my point .
well , we .
. you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . <person> ' t that what you did ?
because <person> and his men don ' t work the performer train and they ' ll red-light him if they find him . he can ' t work anymore .
my god .
risk hitting it a little thin and --
for godsakes , <person> , that ' s enough !
did you like it ; me watching you ?
i guess . i ' ve got an ego same as any man .
wow . and where do the batteries go ?
very funny .
i should have known , you were just too helpful .
eio rule one , man . <person> . now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone .
<person> , <person> . !
i know , i know . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m sorry i got so mad before . i just don ' t want him , you know -- terrified of `` telling , '' if there ' s --
<person> ' s just not get worried about anything just now .
after all this mess then .
let me try to locate the lad first <person> . be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon .
be careful <person> . he ' s dangerous . <continued_utterance> <person> koenig , the best inspector in the lapd , digging . he ' ll find <person> and when he does he ' ll find <person> . then <person> . <continued_utterance> where is he ?
yup , that ' s right . <person> prom . kinda .
and did everything -- ?
why am i . why am i whispering in my own house ?

my pleasure , <person> . <continued_utterance> mother of god , what a waste .
i ' m talking about you , <person> --
you got your son back . <continued_utterance> you know , part of the reason i stuck around was `cause i thought i ' d finally get you all to myself . but you didn ' t have any interest in training me . <person> was the one .
what ' s that ?
i found a five-dollar bill , here by the side of the chair .
just try not to bleed .
<person> ' s the face ?

you know who it was and you know you arent , and i mean are not gon na see him ever . end of story .
<person> hell .
you mean all breast , just like you .
you ' re bad --
what is <person> ?
it is a distant castle , where a great king and queen will look after <person> and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule .
it could be an isolated case .
how can we know ? !
yeah , i ' m doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i don ' t even know where to begin .
save it , honey . we want to hear every detail when you get back , but we don ' t want you to run up mr .
' <person> i didn ' t ask him .
aw , shit , thelma , he ' s gon na kill you .
i was afraid , okay ? somehow , i was sure it was <person> at that point . i couldn ' t bring myself to raise my gun to him .
but <person> .
he says he carried you on his back .
i didn ' t have much craft back then -- just a little native ability . <person> ' s a great ball- striker .
she ' ll get over it .
you even brought the plane for us . we really couldn ' t have done it without you . <continued_utterance> a man tires of being executed . <continued_utterance> but then again . there is no point in living if you can ' t . feel alive .
enjoying yourself ?

you want to drive a cadillac , learn how to drive . you want to get even with somebody ? you picked the wrong person to get even with . nobody backs into traffic , smashes my car and says they want to get even .
say you love me .
i love you . now give me the line .
i am going over here .
god damn , you people are confusing .
we serve the interests of the british people , <number> . no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect . <continued_utterance> but if <person> is involved with that uranium , i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth .
hopefully , it won ' t get that far .
hes a stone fuckin criminal , honey , and you aint .
i killed <person> , didn't i ?
you got what stuck ?
it .
<person> . but i do know one thing : you ' re exactly like him . my father was born wanting only one thing : to be president .
and what ' s wrong with that ?
<person> !
we ' ll get twenty years if the cops find this on us ! <person> down the fire escape and hide it . anywhere ! <continued_utterance> hey , whatever you do , don ' t lose the goddamn dope , we got ta be able to return it to those dealers or we ' re dead . those guys are serious .
i ' d just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down .
<person> , <person> . no vendettas on my ship . now : remember what i told you about <person> ? watch the grass , watch the trees , watch the shit house , be on your toes , and if we get committed , don ' t hesitate to empty that sucker .
all right , lunger . <person> at it .
on three ? you call it .

<person> ?
yes , yes , hit me . beat me , please .
you been a bad girl , <person> . you took my heart from your mama , didn ' t ya ? you betrayed her ! like you did me . there ain ' t no forgivin ' ya , girl !
but . ?
the cardinal expressed in confidence how much the celebration would mean to you .
uh , mr . <person> , we took a little loss today . we got stopped out on tarafly . . about <number> thousand .
i guess your father ' s not a union representative on that company .
what ? !
people are miserable all over the world and you ' re killing yourself ? you should be ashamed .
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody ' s dying to meet you .
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
watching your vr people <person> gave me the idea .
it ' s nanotechnology , isn ' t it ?
<person> .
god damn , <person> . i thought you said you could play . <person> doesn ' t answer . <person> winks at him . <continued_utterance> boys , it ' s all over but the cryin ' .
you talk to im some ? .
some . <person> said <person> promised to have him and <person> out of here by the weekend .
<person> .
he asked me to take his `niece and nephew ' to their cousin in oxnard . these beautiful , funny little kids . i dropped them off . <person> ' t ask any questions -- i believed <person> . a week later i saw their pictures in the post office . a week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near san pedro . i ' ll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought i was part of it . that i knew what was going to happen to them . so i pray to god that he let them look in when i put that knife into <person> . but i ' ll never ask his forgiveness for doing it . why do they call you `enforcer ? '
well . i keep bumping into you . hope your mango ' s ripe .
i think it is . want to bump into me saturday ? around lunchtime ? <continued_utterance> how about meeting saturday ? the first day of spring . <number> p . m . there ' s a place in riverside park at <number> th <person> where the path curves and when you come around the curve , you ' ll find me waiting .
how much ?
with all my heart .
just til sunday .
<person> , no . the other falls are clear on the other side . it would take you a couple nights just to get there .
<person> ' s see . <person> step through the office . <person> step out the door .
that ' s perfect . keep going .
you could grace our hallowed halls again , if , while you ' re here , you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
i ' d do that --
<person> was catholic ?
yeah . so am i .
<person> . i was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?
why can ' t you come .
what are you talkin ' about ?
go .
<person> , because nobody else was there . you ' re lucky i was walking by . <continued_utterance> <person> , it ' s possible i dreamed that -- but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons ? not a dignified death .
he was a small man . oh collapses face down in the sand .
oh , <person> !
they ' re not . i had the pictures .
that was our insurance company ' s recommendation .
yes . it would be .
what ' s a five letter word for a portuguese overseas province ?
<person> .
<person> -- you will , <person> ! i want ya to start counting backwards from a hundred for me .
one hundred . ninety-nine . ninety-eight . ninety-seven . ninety-six . ninety-five . his voice drops off ; his eyes close . lull studies him , adjusts some instruments , then turns to <person> , glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her .
<person> .
<person> .
<person> . another macho idiot . conto , per favore !
what ' s the lure , <person> ? obviously not his character . is it the money ? the luxury ? what ' s any of that worth if you ' re getting shot at and you could go to jail ?
you ' re both idiots !
oh yeah , then why are we free and you ' re chained up ?
<person> . can you stop , please ?
you ' re gon na talk to her , right ?
really ? that was fast .
i ' m kidding . <person> ?
better that than <person> .
<person> , my god !
if it stops them from hurting you and me . maybe we should .
absolutely not . no fucking way . forget the fact , that the moment you get pregnant , they ' ll kill me . then the moment you give birth , you ' re dead . beyond both of those reasons . ain ' t no fucking way i am going to give them our child . <continued_utterance> for all my coward marriage moments . i ' ve thought about our child . is that stupid ? i picture what he ' ll be like .
she ' s kind of a pill .
she ' s probably not as attractive as she seems on television either .
dude , i ' m your assistant coach . and just notice who isn ' t here . <continued_utterance> <person> .
<person> , i got it .
what ?
in the window . <person> ' s at work .
<person> ' <person> ' mcavoy . representing the great american southwest .
do we have a . mccormack . on the list .
here . there is no wind here . but over there - a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground .
you lie about everything . you say you aren ' t worried but it ' s clear you are . i know the war is approaching but you say , `` oh , it ' s just a trick of the wind . ``
my god , <person> , look at this .
the name is so familiar but --
they ' ve been taken care of .
what do you mean ? <continued_utterance> what are you going to do with me ?
no , now it ' s about us . <person> ' s do something for us before we both get killed . <person> ' t you want to get to <person> , <person> ?
we can ' t leave now . we have to do something .
time to come home for dinner , honey .
i got ta go .
i will call the police right now if i don ' t start getting some answers .
<person> please .
nice to run into you again .
<person> ' s not make it a habit .
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of .
what are they going to do ? not invite me to their birthday party . ? look , i got ta go . i have to be in cambridge .
you don ' t love me ? <continued_utterance> but we ' re so right for each other .
i know . <continued_utterance> that woman on television , right ? sidney-ann .
there was a time when i would have welcomed it .
i know .
what ' s going on ?
i ' m gon na find out everything about this son of a bitch , and then i ' m gon na find the one thing that cuts him to the quick .
yes ?
como esta , amigo . i have with me one of the legendary ball strikers in the history of golf -- the security guard strains to see in .
why ?
you know what , <person> ? it ' s personal . this is a personal matter that has to do with <person> . i just have to go see her for a little while .
that ' s right . they want something . dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you ' re the one to see .
so what did these . people . say about me exactly ?
or disinformation . if you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? maybe one degree a minute ?
fantastic idea mr . <person> ! perhaps i should buy it for a book ! it ' s totally preposterous , but - you amuse me . . and now perhaps i can amuse you . <continued_utterance> let ' s see . first we have this james <person> . i believe he ' s a field adjuster for <person> ' s of london .
ah , mr . <person> . you ' re just in time to congratulate your nephew . he inherited the empire .
every morsel of it ?
no .
what do you mean no ? they can fly us home .
if you ' re not , how come you ' re making such a big thing out of it ?
it ' s the fact the <person> <person> ' s on the ponderosa . he ' s in the middle of nowhere . it ' s not like he ' s living on reisterstown road with houses all around . we ' re talking about the west here . it ' s the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the west . it doesn ' t make sense , that ' s all i ' m saying .
you had to see his face when that wave hit . he wasn ' t scared <person> . it was like he was expecting it , waiting for it . he knew it was coming .
why would he fake it ? he ' s not <person> .
oh god . this is insane .
what ' s insane is the fact that <person> here put a fucking girl ' s head through a toilet . that ' s insane .
<person> ' t know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
that ' s just mean . oh . <person> wanted to know if i could get her some .
you don ' t care what people say ?
you mean care what you say ? i ' m worrying about other things .
weapons . misdemeanor one .
counselor , you ' re insulting me .
it was <person> .
did you say it was <person> ?
that sounds like my game , all right .
that sounds like a game that ' s not going to be easy to market .
i do .
you said you ' d cut that up with the man who did her in .
you tell me , <person> . if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?
turn state ' s evidence . take the stand on this and we ' ll hear it out .
<person> and i just bought this divine house in pleasant valley . do you know it ? great for the kids . <continued_utterance> it ' s the first time i ' ve left the doors unlocked since i was a child growing up in the midwest . <person> ' s been promoted to vp of united motors so it ' s all happening for us . but enough of me . how are you ?
oh , we have two kids . twins , <person> and <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number>
what is a sip of coffee going to do ?
<person> is bad for anybody , especially for a child .
that ' s not the way to <person> ' s trailer . i told you .
i am not going to <person> ' s trailer .
one bullet , maybe .
oh . oh , i see -- you hit the turkey more than once . while he was flying . in the head .
you ' re really good friends with the chancellor , aren ' t you ?
pretty good . i ' m friends with dr . <person> , too .
oh , yeah ? well , you ' re not handcuffed to him . anybody in the back room ?
it ' s all yours .
we can live in a hacienda .
i wan na get a job . i wan na work at club med .
try the fort laramie treaty . all over again .
<person> . you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up , talking about what ' s right and what ' s wrong . you ' re from the reservation . it ' s a different world .
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
what if it never happens ? what if
what if you ' re wrong ? you just said she ' s the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ?
i did try calling her . a few years ago . she wasn ' t listed .
maybe you ' re not supposed to . <continued_utterance> i might kiss you .
i might do it wrong .
where you headed ?
i don ' t know . i have to make a stop in vegas . business to finish . then maybe i ' ll head to <person> . i might be able to pick up some action there .
yeah . everything ' s cool .
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody ' s dying to meet you .
not our <person> ?
i wish it wasn ' t .
i mean anybody . <continued_utterance> i heard what <person> said to you . he said , `` we have enemies in our own house . `` he said it as he was dying .
i don ' t think he died . i mean , do you ? i think he maybe fainted . <continued_utterance> that was <person> , head of publicity and marketing , at antenna hq . <continued_utterance> . on that very expensive pink- fone you threw away . <continued_utterance> he said that some bizarre fanatical group called the anti- existenzialists has put a price of <number> million dollars on your head , payable to anybody who kills you . it ' s been released to all the media now . everybody knows about it .
am i cursed ?
no . put the casket down .
greg , right ? are you polish ?
grabowski .
what do you mean `` got '' to the dog ?
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce , whatever it ate or absorbed , cell for cell . <continued_utterance> the concept is staggering . i know . i . i don ' t fully understand it myself .
did he say if he wants to see me ?
he doesn ' t say much . he ' s just not that happy kid he was .
you already did .
anyways , when you ever shot a gun ? probably miss and shoot yourself in the foot .
to collect . i have the things you need to destroy <person> ' s play . these same things can be used to destroy you .
things like ?
the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people ' s lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .
i understand the risks involved here . but there is nobody better qualified to go after <person> <number> . <number> than <person> . and , there is nobody who knows him better than you . if a situation becomes volatile , you will find a way to quell it . i have complete confidence in you .
<person> ' ites , i think .
is that good , or bad ?
drop the package . put your hands behind your head . you ' re under arrest .
i don ' t understand . i think there must be some mistake .
you ' re not from around here , are you ?
oz .
well , what does it have to do with ?
no . <person> , it ' s me okay ? can ' t it just be about me ? for once ?
someplace else , then .
where ?
should we bring the police into this ?
no , not yet .
i didn ' t even think about it .
there . you gave me a chocolate .
it ' s a mental thing . helps me focus . the one thing you don ' t want to do is miss with the stud- finder .
oh , god .
he ' s drunk .
in vino veritas .
<person> . when i fill out my <number> , do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation ?
<person> --
i swear to you i wouldn ' t have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case .
what you thought ! ? what you thought . i ' m a workingman , i ' m trying to get my wife out of town , we hired you , we ' re paying you , i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred .
and he has no qualms about .
none . he believes that man should honor no kings before god .
yes . <person> rid of him .
how would i do that ? send him on a trip - like maybe to hawaii ?
i love you .
that was really convincing .
maybe we should just .
<person> .
really .
<person> is it ?
you want to go home ?
yeah .
of course .
how much ?
we look forward to your updates .
<person> , pass a message to <person> : i want him to meet me at the one-thousand block of south tremaine tonight at <number> and at some point between now and then , i ' ll need him to do a preliminary work- up on a woman named <person> . b-l-e-d-s-o-e . thanks .
<person> .
<person> . i can ' t take the rejection . i ' m going to class .
how ?
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we ' ve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .
no , forget it , it was stupid .
come on , what were you going to say ?
i believe that ' s the law . is it not , mr . <person> . ?
dr . <person> . from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventy-six . <continued_utterance> in your opinion , what happened to <person> ?
what killed those men ?
what killed them i won ' t even write about . i tell you , they ' d do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
very well . i ' ll explain to <person> and <person> that you didn ' t care to come to the show tonight .
i ' ll have you court-martialed !
it doesn ' t look like a menorah .
i know . i don ' t know what came over me .
you ' re on somethin ' again , aren ' t you ?
<person> .
that ' s bullshit ! <person> out that door , i ' m changing the locks .
you may not believe this <person> but i really do care for you . i think we could ' ve made a good team . but that ' s how it goes .
primarily . although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia . you missed a few bottles , by the way .
i ' m sure . where is everyone ?

it will be <person> all over again .
appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive . confidence in our security commitments around the world will falter , allies will become unsure in the face of soviet pressure , and the soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder . we must remove the missiles one way or another . it seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis ' til they give in , or we hit them . an air strike .
nothing happened .
then why aren ' t you testifying for their side ? <continued_utterance> i can subpoena you , you know . i can get you up there on the stand .
august loves his sideshow freaks . there ' s a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest . he dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leather shoes . no talent but a real money- maker with the rubes . calls himself the man and a half . <person> ' ll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony .

i ' m getting by . <continued_utterance> you want to know how i ' m doing ? every day , i lose a little bit more of myself . i ' m becoming something else , and it scares the hell out of me . he turns back toward the transport . <person> follows . two armed guards open the back doors for parker , then stand poised with weapons out and ready .

<person> , you don ' t know what you are talking about . quit trying to hold on so tight . i ' m gone . long gone like a turkey through the corn .
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together .
its a comfortin idea .
noooo .
<person> , this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week . you remember the .
we ' re even . by the way , i did find your husband .

too hot . <person> ' t do it . <person> ' t come in .
<person> , i worked at <person> , i know my way around , i have friends there . inside .
what does that mean ?
<person> is a different person now .
i don ' t make no bones about where i ' m going to spend eternity . i have always been wild and you know that . if you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?
<person> ' t go that far .

what killed them i won ' t even write about . i tell you , they ' d do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
i ' ll know soon enough .
what ' s that ?
you came to gloat .
slick graphics , huh ? see these dudes ? they ' re called `` <person> <number> '' , they ' re the bad guy bosses .
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
then here ' s a little bump .
drugs weren ' t even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem . opiates . but , who was using ' em ? chinese immigrants . <person> labor . and the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music . <person> on the fringe . artists . decadent rich people . and who got scared ? white men in power . who ' s scared today ? white men in power . if j . p . <person> and <person> . <person> ever admitted using , it ' d be a whole different story .
me ? what can i do ?
gee , i don ' t know , <person> . <person> . you ' re good at that .
oh . right .
you must be <person> .

`` <person> . <person> '' viktor laughs and joins in . then <person> looks down and spots the roach cam .
<person> .
<person> . this is so crazy . i mean . i don ' t even understand why you . i don ' t even get it .
what do you want me to say ? everything you said about me was true , <person> . i was just a big chickenshit jerk , and now i ' m payin ' the price .
well , can you come back inside ?
yeah . sure .
just paying my last respects .
what happened ? !
who was the best you ever saw ?
<person> i ever saw ? <person> tin man i ever saw ? <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> . those guys had good lines , but they burned themselves out too fast . <person> ? <person> ' s the best . the best there ever was . if he ' s in the door , he ' s got a sale . the best closer ever .
well , i -- i can ' t quite see . why , she ' s crying .
oh --
just one more -- thank you . i thought you knew everything ?
what do i know , eh ? <person> needs a victory very badly . he needs to prove to <person> that he is still winning . he thinks <person> ' s death is the proof he needs .
i had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines .
the owner is the father of a friend of mine .
i ' m sure she is , <person> . but i ' m afraid you ' ll have to ' kiss off ' the rest of your lessons this afternoon .
<person> . here i was , finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
<person> .
have you been a patient of dr . <person> ' s for a long time ?
well , it wasn ' t from clean living .
if you had to do it again , would you still go for the green on eighteen ?
take your time . i wish i had .
we will .
how can you see me if i ' m not here ?
you ' re trying to trick me .
<person> , this isn ' t about you . this is something that ' s happening to me . it ' s not to get even . and it ' s not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not .
sweetheart --
i want someone who was in the o . r . we ' re going to win the case , there ' s no question of that . it ' s just a matter of how big .
i ' ve got nothing to say to you .
so you struck out again with <person> , huh ? that <person> is a real smooth operator .
he ' s an asshole ! ' i heard you ' re not ready yet . ' ' we ' re gon na kick your ass . ' well , we may be behind schedule , but we ' re still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe i haven ' t scored with <person> yet , but neither has he . she ' s not an easy lay , that ' s what i like about her . you know what they say : it ain ' t over till it ' s over . <person> and <person> go into the living room . <person> is picking up glasses . <person> is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket .
i wanted to be your friend .
oh .
no . much more .
it wore off .
you got ta leave .
just tell me what the hell ' s going on ?
why would i spy on you ?
i am your competition . which you know perfectly well or you would not have put up that sign saying `` just around the corner . ``
so what does that mean ?
how the hell am i supposed to remember ? i was high all the time . <continued_utterance> where ' d you get that bandana ?
i ' ll give you a hint . it ' s not the louvre .

<person> ' t worry about it .
i don ' t want to see any more beef jerky . i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window . it ' s drivin ' me crazy . the whole car smells like it .
it ' s good . it ' s what the pioneers ate .
did you come here for money ?
mom , that ' s a terrible thing to ask .
whats with you ? . you know what take care of him means . i dont call <person> except for one big reason .
big is the key word , and im telling you i want it bad .
<person> , are you telling me you don ' t know where <person> lives ?
some apartment somewhere . but i ' ve never seen it .

well don ' t then ! you don ' t want to fall in .
it ' ll be the principals , a couple of the key guys from each department : the executive committee of the national security council . we ' ll call it excom .
excom . has a ring to it . like f-troop .

<person> !
the machine in the sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet . there are tunnels and ducts everywhere , all powered by fusion generators .

no .
she was small . most people don ' t know that . the shoulders are small . it looks so perfect . i bet it ' s the only time she wore it . that day . she must ' ve felt so . happy . <continued_utterance> it ' s feels unreal , like butterfly wings or . something . it must ' ve cost dr . <person> a lot .
i guess . <person> never tells <person> the truth about how much he pays for these things .
<person> ?
and i was wondering .
it wasn ' t sofia .
who was it ?
<person> got the paper ?
yeah .
where ?

i have no more questions at this time . <continued_utterance> oh , one last thing . <person> ' t true that your father was a sea captain ?
yes .
i just got it fixed .
you ' re on .
yes , i can .
you can ' t !
the same to you . if you are in <person> , come to the bay islands and visit us . the hondurans are great friends of the american people . but i have a joke for you before i go . if a liberal , a socialist , and a communist all jumped off the roof of the empire state building at the same time , which one of them would hit the ground first ?
i couldnt say , which one ?

<person> , <person> .

i ' m in a dream .
. was the man at the restaurant ? <continued_utterance> sometimes the mind behaves as if it were in a dream . faces change , people become other people . the subconscious is a powerful thing . you treated <person> carelessly , didn ' t you , <person> ? your feeling of responsibility or guilt over <person> might have easily turned <person> into <person> . do you know what derangement is ?
how ' s this going to work ?
me and wes each going take an end of the rope , run our asses of , and yank you off the mine .
well why don ' t you look her up ?
yeah , right .

not until somebody gets a search warrant signed . it ' s sunday . i don ' t think they ' ve even found a judge , yet . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na have to call this in .
you climb damn it , or so help me i ' ll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there !
<person> ! ! !
i made the bioport sacrifice to get close to you , to make love to my enemy .
why would you do that ?
i wonder where her ring is ? <person> notices the mark on her hand as well .
yeah . personal effects include a watch , under garments , and a blue waitress uniform . the ring is missing . it says the rest of her things haven ' t been removed yet from the trailer . <person> ' s hope it ' s there .
<person> , no . well except for the lint .
<person> ?
i was her doctor .
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy .
the post-vegas man .
a mutant species .
what are you doing on the reservation ?
i ' m on my way back in . over .
the world ' s gone insane . good men locked in cages , criminals running free . it doesn ' t pay to be honest , <person> .
<person> ' t call me a <person> . my name is <person> .
i ' ll eat there .
<person> sure you do .
against a window .
in the passenger car ?
they ' re going to be pressing for a military solution soon . we can ' t afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats . we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here .
we got a bunch of smart guys . we lock ' em up together in there , kick ' em in the ass til they come up with options . <continued_utterance> i ' ll do it .
no there isn ' t , man ! it ' s narrow . it ' s dull . it ' s a dull , narrow town full of dull , narrow people who don ' t know anything except . what things are like right around here . they have no perspective whatsoever . no scope . they might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what ' s going on , and if you try to tell ' em that , they wan na fuckin ' kill you .
what are you talking about ?
<person> , can you get me a cup of coffee ? <continued_utterance> you guys want anything else ?
er . hum . er . hey , wing .

so she ' s married ?
what the fuck are you doing here ?
what the fuck are you doing here ?
and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?
no .
well , i should recommend you go work on your short game but i think it ' s better if you go get drunk instead .
get drunk ?
hm .
my god , i wear the same scent as a transvestite . she is a transvestite , isn ' t : she ?
but you ' re wounded .
<person> ' t worry . i fight just as well with my left hand .
-who ' s `we ? '
me and <person> .
ail right . by the way , his friend . ?
the answer ' s yes . i think . yes . i don ' t know . where are they exactly ?
hm ?
on your ear , you ' ve got something .
i had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute .
uh-huh .
i swear . <person> , i almost feel like i know you .
well . you don ' t .
got to , <person> . you and i are going to a courthouse together , put some people behind bars .
have you got your gun on now ?
what do you want for free ?
you sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .
i ' d prefer to park it myself . temperamental . <person> has a mind of its own .
<person> ' t they all ?
what do you think ?
nothing .
nothing .
nothing ?
we ' re the good guys , ms . <person> .
so are we ! we ' re on the verge of
yes --
please , professor , why can ' t we go along with you ? <continued_utterance> . polite ! we haven ' t been asked yet .
what awaits me ?
trouble , certainly .
i was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee .
i don ' t drink coffee . <person> want ?
why don ' t you tell him to just to get lost once and for all ?
why don ' t you ditch that loser husband of yours ?
what ?
i know ! and his wife is six months pregnant .
we neutralized anybody with a voice . <person> , <person> . <person> . anyone who was standing in the way of the land . is that it ?
no . we neutralized enemies of the <person>ed states . anti-american radicals who have killed federal officers out here ! <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> . you think i don ' t like the indians ? not true . these were noble people but their day is gone . they ' re a conquered nation . they want all of america back but they can ' t even keep the garbage out of their own front yards . it ' s sad , <person> . but it ' s just the way it is . we have to function as a colonial police force out here .
come on , <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , whoa . <person> , now , easy now , <person> . <person> , whoa , whoa .
<person> ! it ' s hopeless - we can ' t help them .
the democrat , sir . by nine points .
maybe it ' s time to publish that story about his sex life . even things up . a close race is always better for our tv ratings .
you invited me .
only if you are a good man , a friend . are you a friend ?
let me guess : retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof !
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning expos changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .
well , you talk like a golfer --
shit .
what big dog ?
the driver , the number one wood --
<person> for what ? what are you supposed to be doing ?
i told you , i ' m shooting iraqis .
shoot him ? like with a gun ?
yes .
hey .
hi , i ' m <person> .
give it to me !
mexico ? you going to mexico ?
<person> , i love you . do you hear me ? <continued_utterance> let ' s just go to my place . we ' ll worry about this tomorrow .
<person> ?
periodistas ! take this picture ! i ' m going to blow his head off .
<person> ? he is a tyrant too , of course . a butcher . but finally that is not the point , you see . if we wish to survive -- we have a choice of tyrants , and for all the right reasons , your poets choose the wrong side .
so she ' s married ?
nope . never been .
yes , sir !
we aren ' t barbarians .
you ' re officer of the watch , <person> .
i ' m sorry , <person> . it ' s this damned book . <person> gave it to me . <continued_utterance> son-of-a-bitch .
are you kidding ?
me neither . i ' m terrified to look under the plates . <continued_utterance> this `` support for the fanatics '' thing doesn ' t sound too good .
i just can ' t go back in front of judge <person> , it won ' t look good , trust me .
so maybe you ' ll get a different judge .
we got the same thing .
<person> , go tell your wife to come in .
thanks , <person> .
what a day , huh ?
what ?
you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait .
looks change .
maybe it ' s because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires , so then can she . <continued_utterance> she can become a child again . who wouldn ' t want that ?
what did <person> ' s tie mean ?
what ? that ' s just <person> ' s bad taste .
i am not going to <person> ' s trailer .
well , where are you going ?
why didn ' t you catch a plane ?
my feet have never been on anything that wasn ' t directly attached to the ground .
i don ' t want it this way . i wouldn ' t kill you just to kill you , but i can ' t let you lose the gold for me . not when we ' re so close .
that helicopter passes , and the only thing we ' re close to is death .
i think so . if she didn ' t she should have . i ' ve only got maybe an hour . then volleyball practice is over and i have to be home .
why ? nobody ' s there .
you ' re so naive bud , you don ' t even know . your dad took care of you . i might ' ve been rich when i was a kid . but my father lost all his money . in the seventies , in the stock market , at the track . he was a lousy gambler .
. that changes all my plans , i thought you were loaded .
you are very important , <person> .
no i ' m not . have you really looked at me ? i ' m short ! even for a nelwyn ! <continued_utterance> why can ' t you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .
i ' m a terrible shot , <person> , don ' t believe i ' ll ever hit the target . he hands back the cutters .
thanks . <continued_utterance> cheerio , mate . <continued_utterance> you ' ll take good care of him , yes ?
no .
i ' ll put this right through your head .
blonde .
tell me some other things about her .
we ' ve got to appear ?
i think that ' s the gist of what they ' re saying .
you think so , baby ? does my talkin bother you , honey ?
no , i like gettin up around four a . m . and talkin bout wild animals . though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream . i kinda wish i didn't remember it . up at pee dee , i couldnt remember any of my dreams .
i am the demon from the bottomless pit .
. here on earth to create havoc and terror . i am war , i am death . i am destruction . <person> berkowitz,
<person> comes to me for help on their love life about women is already too far gone .
i don ' t recall asking you for advice . women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie --
yes ?
have you heard anything yet ? i mean , about the existenz test seminar and the shooting ?
not a chance , mr . <person> . such things are reserved for girl talk only . and for good reason .
<person> well , sheeni . <person> ' t be long .
<person> said you were good . the tailored dress is our code for drugs . did you notice what was pinned to it ?

<person> , <person> . we ' re going .
i thought you hated <person> and prejudice .
-- or was she too prejudiced and mr . <person> too proud ? i can never remember . it wasn ' t personal --
she ' s wearing a ring .
my guess is there isn ' t enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring , but we should do a blowup of this anyway .
about a year ago .
he dropped <person> off first ?
shut your mouth .
back in ` <number> , <person> the good witch put a blade in her pimp `bout as deep as i put my pink in her , this mongrel named <person> . <continued_utterance> could use a couple lapd favors , and ain ' t guttin ' a pimp still a crime ?

<person> ? did you say <person> ?
i don ' t get it . i just don ' t get it .
only the elders .

<person> , it ' s too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i can ' t go <person> and i can ' t sneak , feel back enough as it is .

yes . the ghost . <continued_utterance> i thought it was mrs . <person> , but it ' s not .

i ' m meeting a player from temple university . he ' s a cornerback . you like football ?
if you shared your heart with this woman -- maybe asked her out to dinner -- then it would force these issues out in the open .

if it ' s all the same , i ' d like to stay on deck .
take the wheel .
just stay down .
what are we going to do ? what the hell are we going to do ?
then i fear our two nations will go to war . and i fear where war will lead us .
if the missiles do not become operational , if you remove the missiles , then there will be no war . at this moment , the president is accepting the terms of secretary <person> ' s letter of friday night . if the soviet union halts construction immediately , removes the missiles , and submits to u . n . inspection , the united states will pledge to never invade <person> or aid others in that enterprise .
lem me see it ! <continued_utterance> i know what happened . it ' s <person> , that bastard .
<person> ?
the only way i could think to get out of this business .
hey , that ' s good . that ' s good , yeah .
he ' s extremely talented -- in fact , i hate to tell you this , but i think he and his group are gon na win the competition .
well , we ' ll see about that .
that ' s pretty simplistic , don ' t you think ?
hey , pal , you don ' t start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens .
what are you talking about ? <person> didn ' t kill anybody .
you want to see .
<person> , this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week . you remember the .

`` long life to the grape ! for when summer is flown , the age of our nectar <person> gladden our own . `` that ' s <person> , you know .
professor .
what is it ?
all those people out there . it ' s a lot of pressure .
<person> ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
<person> and <person> ?
they ' re pretty pissed off . they ' ll do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they won ' t let me in without you .
but programmable . and expendable .
i ' ve seen enough . turn it off . <continued_utterance> they ' re degenerates . there ' s not a man in there that would give a damn if the chinese took over .
well , so might you if you ' d been where he ' s been , seen what he ' s seen !
well , he don ' t talk to me about it .
no . when should we start .
i figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of <person> <person> ' s business connections in the third world countries with c . i . a . influence .
oh . <continued_utterance> agent desmond , it ' s .
it ' s late , <person> .
<person> ' t show up for work last night . called a friend of hers , a waitress that works here too , said she was at bido lito ' s in hollywood . said she was `hiding out . '
she actually said `hiding out ? '
something i couldn ' t show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i ' d just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i ' ve never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
how was it contracted ?
that ' s just media talk . they ' re . . just a minority . they ' re powerless .
well , there ' s a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to <person> . we ' re broke . i ' m just a slave around this dump . now if you were capable of finding a better job .
what ?
big cheese in town . big smelly cheese .
you want to talk about renaissance men , you got ta talk about <person> . <person> unorthodox trainer , and one of the best in the game . he ' s well known for using classical music to train his fighters to remain calm , to remain patient , and to remain composed under pressure .
<person> music is about as fitting to this setting as <person> is to this tournament . in fact , let me show you something .
this whole time , you ' ve kept your head . you didn ' t go money simple like me and <person> . you ' ve just been trying to figure how to get us out of here . and you ' ve been fair too . i mean , even after i . you know .
threatened to blow my brains out ?
i had to see you .
what ' s happened ? tell me ! is it jotunheim ? let me explain to
no , no , no , wait !
so long <person> !
the war has taken everything from everyone .
what will happen to them ?
i don ' t care . you heard that girl ' s statement . i think he ' s dirty . get me a case .
well you were a big help . you know what ' s going to happen if we go full-bore on this .
' because if we do , she ' ll think we ' re trying to get rid of her . '
' she ' ll sure think the same if i do it . you ' re her father and comes a time when a father ' s got ta mention . '
<person> said shit , <person> --
relax . we ' re waiting , that ' s it .
what kinda trash talk is that ?
what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .
do you want to talk ?

your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations
yes . i ' m sorry . i ' m starting over . thank you for coming . <person> . thank you for coming . <person> .
i bought you flowers .
but what if <person> gets another dinosaur ? a mean one ? i just don ' t think i can take that kind of rejection .
hey , listen , no one ' s getting replaced . this is <person> we ' re talking about . <continued_utterance> it doesn ' t matter how much we ' re played with . what matters is that we ' re here for <person> when he needs us . that ' s what we ' re made for . right ?
how ?
let him put <person> ' s name in nomination .
hey , rhonda , what ' s the name you call those things , huh ?
where ' d they come from ?
well , i can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement , but .
well -- brian ? i understand what you ' re saying , and i think it ' s great . i do . because there ' s a lot of things around here that could use some attention . believe me . but i ' ve honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes , and if i take the time out of my lunch hour .
you know , clean the pipes .
pipes ? what are you talking about ?
-- we could bum around the world for a year on that .
and then what , <person> ? we ' d be back to where we were five years ago . you ' re talking like a teenager .
thanks , <person> .
i ' ll be blunt . i know you can take it .
i quit workin for im , but just before i did , i ended up one night at a house . i dont know what it is they all think i saw that night , but i was just sittin out in the car till the whole place went up in flames .
god , sailor . thats the night my daddy died .
and for dessert , anisette biscotti and a thermos of espresso .
<person> .
<person> ' t --

aaarrgghh .
where are they ? where are the musketeers ? i ' m in the right place , aren ' t i ?
when i came upon the valley of bones , the serpent said , `` make this your home . dry as my soul be , heaven is lost to thee . `` we all got to make way . <continued_utterance> a chicken hates to see the preacher coming to dinner .
<person> , you will have to catch the next one ' cause i ' m out of breath .

we do not go into your courts .
i don ' t know how to behave around an eight-year-old ?
that ' s right --
<person> answer . <person> goes double for me .
who ' s your friend ?
<person> . <person> . so listen , uh , i was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know , with me . <person> looks unenthused . ted it ' s no big deal , whatever i mean , if you want .

i told you , sweetheart . we got pushed apart by the crowd . this older married couple brought me to the ferry .
i ' d like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge .

but he ' s put it off for so long now , i fear . <continued_utterance> you ' re a good son . <continued_utterance> we mustn ' t lose hope that your father will return to us . and your brother .
what hope is there for <person> ?
i had it all backwards . i had it all wrong .

chancellor .

well --
edie .
i don ' t buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly don ' t believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?
that could take days . i need to do something now . <person> ' t you see ? she wants us dead .
<person> , alright . <person> calm . you opened this door . there ' s got to be a way that you can close it .
you think the bifrost is the only way in and out of the realm ? there are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind . but i have need of them no longer , now that i am king . <continued_utterance> and i say , for your act of treason , you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper . and you are no longer a citizen of <person> .
then i need no longer obey you .
no way . you ' re going for the green . these fans paid good money to see golf shots they can ' t hit , not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit . <continued_utterance> thirteen years on tour and you ' re still a pussy . hit the fucking one iron , <person> .

you ' re learning some discipline and self-control .
and that there ' s a time in life to play it safe .
um . sure .
i couldn ' t catch my breath . that ' s not a metaphor , that ' s . and i panicked . i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there . i tried to leave him . went to my mother ' s in boston . he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home . <person> is mesmerized . <continued_utterance> you must think i ' m pathetic .

we check out the area and wait for a time when it ' s clear .
what about the blood ?
oh , no -- no !
that ' s all -- the crystal ' s gone dark .

since the beginning .
that would be very helpful to me . also , i received the offer from dea and the fbi to train some of my men at quantico . i think this will be extremely useful , a good way for us to absorb some of your methods . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been too busy to completely settle in .
you ' ve been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel .
well we should take a drive , your mom can stay with the kids .
<person> . yes , this is him . what ?

the name is <person> . <person> .
looks pretty from up here , but some people think god is going to wipe them out because they ' re so evil .
and what do you think ? am i evil ?
no .
do you know why you ' re here ?
you embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
they really hated it . i think they hated it more than any of the other ones .
well .
<person> fuckin cut you up good .
you heard from reggie ?
we ' re not going anywhere . not ' til we get what we came for .
we just about got killed . you know what happened ? we just about got killed , and you want to go on ?
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .
perhaps <person> had a word with the man upstairs .

i figured out what <person> was up to and i need your help . will you help me ?
it ' s giving .
<person> !
i ' m sorry .
look as bad as i ' ve ever seen you .
you are incredibly brave . i have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling . i ' ve lived like this for years , so i ' m used to it . every day when i get up , i think it might be my last . but it makes you appreciate life . and the moment . because that may be all you have . <continued_utterance> to pull this cover story off , we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other . the enemy can spot a fake easily . <continued_utterance> you see what i mean ? that reaction would give us away in a second . <person> to relax .
it ' s just that . it ' s been sixteen years since anyone but <person> did that , i --
hey , ted . wan na go shopping ?

oh ? anything else ?
oh yes . she thinks you like policing because you think you ' re right about everything . and you ' re the only one who can do anything . and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a . um . bag of elbows . <continued_utterance> i think that ' s what she said . <continued_utterance> good appetite .
so , we get back on that rock and in three days we ' re dead anyway . <continued_utterance> no wait ! this way !

the blood type on the rocks matches <person> ' s .
<person> , you ' ve got to forget .
forget ? remembering is the problem i must ' ve been to one of those artificial memory places .
it means that they want you in the back room . they need more insect boards for the pod assembly bays .
should i just get up and go there ?
<person> , it is your business , but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy .
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his <person> .
i ' m shocked .
yeah . you know <person> .
it ' s no bother , <person> . i ' ll be glad to do it .
wan na bet she ' s out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her ?

i ' m not going left of those trees . i ' m going over those trees . with a little draw . that way i get home in two . that way i ' m putting for eagle .
did you say it was <person> ?
yes . he came to discuss our friendship . i told him now was not the time .
not just nuclear . powered by a nuclear reactor . he ' s not loading any cargo . they want the sub . the sub itself . put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub ' s reactor : instant , catastrophic meltdown .
<person> to look just like an accident .
<person> ' t you touch it .
i just want to look at it . remind me of what i ' m dying for .
that what you got me up here for ?
you ' re a cowboy , you ' re a brother . come back , no hard feelings .
about what ?
every triangle i ' ve ever seen never lasts . somebody ' s got to go .
honey i don ' t have the time .
i need your help .
you mean he withdrew .
not at first . he was still inside but he wasn ' t moving or anything . he said we had this secret . and that now he ' d be able to help me . because we were close . something like that . i don ' t know . it ' s hard to remember , exactly .
i can ' t do it , <person> . not when we ' re so close . i can ' t let you ruin everything .
first <person> , now you ?
she saw someone in the bushes earlier . she ' s reported that kind of thing a dozen other times . she ' s also reported flying saucers , so .
see if any of the other neighbors can verify this `peeper ' thing .
thanks . <continued_utterance> cheerio , mate . <continued_utterance> you ' ll take good care of him , yes ?
i will .
. what difference would .
these people play very rough . they don ' t want to lose this case . there ' s a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , i .
<person> !
the ushers were not supposed to seat you until intermission .
has anyone ever suggested that you ' re a paranoid psychotic ?
harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold . it ' s on the sea dolphin ii . and thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - we ' re the only ones who can tie him to the crime .
you ' re sweet to say so .
pretty song .
kelly wouldn ' t do that .
why not ?
no .
eating ?
yes .
i used to be a nurse .
my own business . thanks for the light . <person> ?
next round ' s on me .
oh , that was just loose talk . husband gettin ' pissed off . i don ' t want anybody dead .
<person> . you wanted me to kill her .
i can ' t believe you used to bring my daughter here , to this place .
hey man , back the fuck up . to this place . what ' s that shit ? right now , all over this country , a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see , you got any drugs ? you know where i can get drugs ? what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person , on their possibilities ? if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood , indian hills , and they asked every white person they saw , hey , you got any drugs ? , within a day , your friends and their kids would be selling . it ' s market forces , man . the product ' s marked up three hundred percent . you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day . you think white people would still be going to law school ?
i do not intend to be party to my brother ' s absurdities . he has allowed you in and drugged my parents .
i think they are deriving some good from the experience .
nice place .
thank you .
we could borrow on that land and put the money to work .
i preached to <person> and dad about it but they are stuck in their ways , it ' s like talking to a brick . but if there is a way .
hold on , iandiacute ; ll get the others .
senator . <person> ?
i ' m sorry about my coat . it ' s too big for your closet .
- we were both pretending to be intellectuals .
the wahoo ?
the sparkler would burn hot , then hotter , then even hotter . and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect . <person> . it would only last a second , but that second was it . it was it . that ' s what dad had us looking for . you get me ?
he was .
<person> ? who was he talking to ? <person> ? come on , <person> ' <person> , everyone ' s wondering what ' s going on . what ' s <person> doing in town ? and don ' t give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks . <person> ' s mr . cold war .
the game made me do it .
i ' m impressed .
it was dad . i swear .
well , the next time he shows up . bring him over . until then , i ' m not saying a word about this to <person> and neither are you .
there is a third option . with either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war . it seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward . <continued_utterance> so i guess i ' ll be . our third choice is to cut a deal . we trade <person> and our missiles in turkey , get them to pull their missiles out . we employ a back channel , attribute the idea to u thant . u thant then raises it at the u . n .
i don ' t think that ' s possible , <person> . i will be asking the networks for air time monday night . i have not yet made my final decision . we will announce our course of action then . i want to thank you all for your advice , gentlemen .
then you have to put him down .
it ' s the right thing to do .
oh , you . <continued_utterance> . you don ' t suppose she could really be sick , do you ? oh -- oh , i ' ve got to go home right away !
but -- what ' s this ? i thought you were going along with me .
<person> , it ' s fun for them , but it ' s heaven for me . those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world . <person> , hey , i got ta run .
<person> , uh , i was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime .
so altruistic .
it ' s the truth . why won ' t you believe it ?
this isn ' t flying . this is falling -- with style !
ha ha ! ! to infinity and <person> ! ! <continued_utterance> uh , <person> ? ! we missed the truck !
where are they ? where are the musketeers ? i ' m in the right place , aren ' t i ?
not as far as i ' m concerned .
<person> -- hurry --
oh ! oh , come on , come on !
where ' s the rest of that skirt ?
<person> .
israel doesn ' t have a king .
then what do they have ?
yes , i guess you ' re right . <continued_utterance> well , we haven ' t really met properly , have we ?
why , no .
i don ' t know anything !

warning . red . one point .
<person> ! hey ! control ! control !

who the fuck is he ?
-and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney-bin .
<person> , <person> recanted . so <person> ' s boxing probe is dead . he ' s got nothing-
<person> , i ' m a failure .
what ?
remember the bowling ball bag <person> carried with him in virtual reality ?
<person> carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week . kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory . we need to get a look at <person> <number> . <number> ' s final profile .
-- you desecrated it , it had to be burned .
i desecrated it ?
here are her diaper rags . and this is her milk bladder . and when she cries -- she ' s either hungry or she ' s tired -- rock her on your left shoulder . she likes that .
<person> ' t worry , <person> . she ' s in good hands . you haven ' t made a mistake .
i ' m just trying to be honest . it ' s been on my mind . on my conscience . <continued_utterance> this plate yours or mine ?
why don ' t you take both . maybe you can choke to death on one of them .
for instance --
for instance i know you jack-off thinking about <person> even though you ' re supposedly `` in love '' with <person> . whatever the fuck that means ? i mean , what is that convention , anyway ? we ' re all these random collections of self-interest , and then we just decide that now we ' re two people walking along -- <person> expels a hit of rock cocaine --
i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . <person> . check it out . tax records , everything --
listen you motherfucker , you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon .
i just figured you was out bein mr . <person> .
not exactly , sugar . one reason were in all the trouble were in right now is cause of what i was doin . i tried to tell you this before .
<person> , i got a rule . i don ' t talk to lawmen . dog-catchers neither .

i ' m sorry he got those birds .
you know the man next door is near death . <continued_utterance> he must have gotten rid of those chickens . you don ' t hear them crowing anymore . i kind of miss it now .
timing is everything . he waited until you were primed . until you knew there was no other man you could ever love .
yes .
shield , whatever they are . they ' re never going to let this research see the light of day .

what ? ohhhh . is that . it ? <continued_utterance> honestly , <person>p . do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you ?
gee , i don ' t know . <person> . i don ' t seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite <number> people over to trash my living room .
i don ' t know . i guess it just feels like i ' m in control . of everything .
<person> , i do . must be nice .
the professor -- <person> walks towards her .
you remember . about women .
<person> ? did you see that ?
she smiles at everyone , ted . she ' s like a newborn with gas . <continued_utterance> the only chick more untouchable than <person> is <person> . `` hi , my name ' s <person> . i love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . `` here ' s a tip : set it on vibrate , honey , and don ' t be stingy with the lube . <person> ' t knock it till you tried it .
i ' m assuming command of this investigation myself .
what investigation ? <person> ' s murder ? <person> ' s disappearance ? what are you investigating ?
one point two million dollars ? i did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars !
i ' m already on a first name basis with these dudes , i got a deal set up , you want me to hammer it or not ?
and now the only thing you ' re putting on sticks are corn dogs .
<person> .
how did i get here ?
i don not understand the question , sir or madam .

but what if we leave them behind ?
oh , don ' t worry , honey , i ' m sure we ' ll find <person> and <person> before we leave tomorrow .
good for you , <person> . you now have exactly <number> seconds to get this rust bucket out of here .
i know my rights . these are international waters . the british navy abandoned that boat , and i ' m claiming it . under international law , i have the right to salvage what ' s on that wreck .
i ' m somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem .
i had to inspect the merchandise first .
<person> was an evil muthafucker . <continued_utterance> . born with ruthless bones . and if he really is dead and gone , this game `bout to explode .
what game ?
ladies and gentlemen , the st crispin ' s day speech from <person> . to set the scene , england is now at war with france . everything rests upon the battle about to begin . <person> , the young king of england , addresses his men thusly : `` my cousin westmorland ? no , my fair cousin- '' <continued_utterance> `` if we are marked to die , we are enow/ to do our country loss ; and if to live . / the fewer me , the greater the share of honour . ``
he ' s got nerve , i ' ll say that . what do you think , <person> ?
yes ! yes ! now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that ?
it ' d have to be pretty good .
right .
brindisi versus <person> .
guess i ' m not used to so much .
not used to hard work . that ' s what makes an appetite .
. and how many of those newspapers carried <person> ' s obituary ?
all of them , mister <person> . after you ?

he ' s dead - good and dead .
you could have poured coffee in starbucks , you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings , you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet . you could have been one of ten thousand things . but in the end , you chose to protect people . you made that decision . and i find that very , very interesting . now all i need is your credit card number . <continued_utterance> that last part was a joke .
i got this job because my college coach called the guy who manages the stadium . there ' s no hidden meaning to it . <continued_utterance> they need me at the gate . <continued_utterance> did you really want to see the game ? i can get you in .

i can ' t get my sleeve out . !
as i remember , no sale was made concerning those customers .
it fell out because a loan couldn ' t be arranged , but the people did agree in principle . the point that we ' d like to stress , is that you misled these people . told them the job was free . then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown , and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars . that is misleading and deceptive sales practice .
you have no idea what my father used to be like . no idea ! he wasn ' t like he is now ! he treated me like shit and he was all i had !
so now you want to return the favor ? is that it ? !
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . we thought there ' d been another fatality , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
have you examined them ?
do you think you could ever shoot someone ?
what ?
yes . <person> right now or right when i thought of it . the name and memory of <person> is haunting me . lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again . because it is only a feeling , i am powerless to stop it . and another thing , <person> , when the next murder happens you will help me solve it .
<person> ' s test it for the record . will the next victim be a man or a woman ?
you can bring one toy .
just one ?
you don ' t buy what ?
ted , i ' m the kind of guy who shoots from the hip . now i want you to level with me : did you knock this skirt up ?
why ?
i stole a car .
got it . nice touch . <person> , pick me up at eight . the de-brief is at ten hundred .
hey , hey , hey . what are we forgetting ?
did the plumber come ?
yes , the fucking plumber came .
<person> , i could too . but . i don ' t know why i ' m even asking you this . it ' s just . we can ' t place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie . i don ' t know . i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable . if just one person would say .
<person> . nothing ' s impossible . you just don ' t shoot someone like that for no reason . maybe he was askin ' for it . <person> , somebody ' s husband probably got ol ' <person> .
you ' re not saying what i think you ' re saying . i can ' t believe you ' re even thinking it .
it ' s right here . this region ; an-nagaf . i got recon photos . there ' re no troops there , no fighting --
<person> . <continued_utterance> oh , mrs . <person> ! i ' ve invited mr . <person> and the others to dinner next friday . <person> , mrs . <person> .
<person> , sir .

<person> . <person> .
how long have you been having them ?
the last month maybe .
it ' s a lot to digest . <person> how you ' d feel .
i ' d feel like staying up all night ! forever ! or at least till i got the lay of the land , so to speak .
i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .
i want to know where <person> is .
sure you do .
<person> . you changed my life .
we have to try the blockades . it probably won ' t work . it may just be delaying the inevitable . but we can ' t just go to war without trying not to .
i don ' t know . i don ' t know .
be with her when she wants . <person> sure she never feels alone .
<person> , i ' m not going anywhere . not yet anyway .
they have , sugar .
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together .
and i think it ' s brilliant ! inspired ! the two leads of <person> ' s magnum opus get kidnapped ! the press ' ll eat it up ! they ' ll write about `gangster mickey , ' the glory days . couple a ' headlines like that and interest in atomic vampires will go through the roof ! who ' s gon na grab you ?
a charmer i knew in another life . <person> .
now tell me , why would i want to do that ?
because i don ' t want to see him hurt .
i was an attorney !
hmmm . i suppose this is a step above that profession . ten seconds . are you leaving ?
hyggelig a mote dem . <person> . <continued_utterance> the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian . so you can talk to them . i want you to learn to say , `` hello , my name is <person> '' .
but my name isn ' t <person> .
<person> , <person> . how did you know my name ?
we ' ve met .
sleeping late ! different women every night ! i can ' t wait !
forget about the new york-washington shuttle ! i ' m off to <person> !
impressive . y ' know , i tend to process things verbally . can you break down into words how you did that ?
' what is the golf swing ? ' -- by <person> . the golf swing is a poem . <continued_utterance> sometimes a love sonnet and sometimes a homerian epic -- it is organic and of a piece , yet it breaks down into elegant stanzas and quatrains . the critical opening phrase of this song is the grip , in which the hands unite to form a single unit by the simple overlap of the smallest finger . . held lightly , a conductor ' s
that ' s it . your brain was getting in the way .
that ' s rarely been a problem .
so what ' s up ?
eh .
oh no ! we ' re bringing the show down here to rehearse !
the company ' s been getting a little ragged . we ' d appreciate the use of the hall .
it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
by then it ' s too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
<person> ' you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
yes .
c ' mon , <person> ! <person> ' t you see who we ' ve got on board today ?
sure i did , why ?
he didn ' t have my lawyer .
i know <person> . he ' s very big on respect . likes me very much . <continued_utterance> now i know your testimony was sealed . <person> is well connected . he still has people running errands for him . what do you think he ' d say if he found out you dropped his name to the d . a . ?
if anything ever happens to me .
i know .
so it ' s still going on ?
and i do not plan to meet him . why do i get the feeling that you are in here somewhere ?
. live in exchange for sexual favors . police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls , all asians twelve to fifteen years old , who have been living in the north houston warehouse with a vietnamese pimp since february . the girls are being treated as victims , said police sergeant amos milburn . these are really just children , he said , but theyve been exposed to a lot already .
<person> bet .
this isn ' t the first time you ' ve spied on me .
nor the second .
there ' s my point exactly .
what ? what ' s your point ?
you crashed my file ?
no . i consulted it . we ' re going into indian country , i wan na know what kind of individual is covering my ass . <person> ' t you ?
and if it ' s unsuccessful ?
incinerate it . like the others .
the company ' s been getting a little ragged . we ' d appreciate the use of the hall .
of course we don ' t expect it free !
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .
what ' s the matter ?
it ' s too rough .

of course . everything in this room is for you . <person> seems genuinely touched by the gesture .
it ' s that woman from the coach !
i ' ll be damned .
so where is <person> now ?
i assume he went back to the boys ' dorm . now really , <person>ie , you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries .
well --
maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss , and were really mean to you , and told you what a terrible thing it was . maybe it ' d be better if you told me how i ' m endangering my immortal soul , and if i don ' t quit i ' m going to burn in hell . <person> ' t you ever think that ?
should be here any minute .
<person> . <continued_utterance> <person> .
can ' t live with them , and you can ' t shoot ' em .
`` you can ' t shoot ' em ! '' i like that . i bet she led you on good , didn ' t she ? taking you up to the house to hang drapes . oh that ' s a good one . bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face . i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . then me busting in like some wild bear . ha ! bet you had a fire going under you .
you know , <person> , you ' re supposed to be my best friend . you could at least be a little bit happy for me . you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isn ' t completely disgusting .
i ' m sorry . i am happy . i ' m very happy for you . i ' m glad you had a good time . it ' s about time . where is he now ?
whizzes right over them , blowing out the match .
no-o-o ! no-no-no-no ! no-o-o !
then you must be the one ' s a liar , right ? and you ' re a performer ?
i guess .
not at all , go right ahead . i ' ve got nothing to hide .
it ' s a collect call from a <person> collins in la paz , bolivia . that wouldn ' t happen to be your pilot friend , would it ? the one who never goes to south america ?
<person> , honey . where are you ? you sound funny .
i am funny . i ' m real funny .
umm .
a hijacker like dean , here ? or something more creative ?
because you were spoiled , don ' t try to spoil <person> .
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and <person> out of trouble was to send us to big daddy ' s farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama ' s hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . <person> will never have to bust his knuckles like we did .
i dont need to explain anymoren i have . you know damn well .
you need to explain it .
<person> ?
<person> !
<person> , chief . i . i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that ' s all .
<person> ' t much look like you were hanging drapes .
<person> , <person> . i just can ' t believe you ' d block something like that out . <person> was at harvard with us . you turned him in for cheating .
what . ?
so why is <person> shipping everyone out ?
<person> ' t you see ? ! from being a pile of red dirt with minerals , <person> is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate .

<person> ' t worry . don ' t worry . i ' ll take care of it tomorrow .
no doubt .
tell me again , franklin , why are we here ?
yes , but my condition is only temporary . i can change it .
i hope you do . we need the money .
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying i ' m gon na buy teldar paper ? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it ' s time to blow out xyz . you mean that ? i ' m afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and i are gon na have a hard time doing any business .
what about hard work ?
no it ' s not okay . it ' s not .
cry for <person> . it ' s okay .

<person> , i kind of thought you were gon na work that out .
well , i did work it out -- more or less --
my fault ? ! if you hadn ' t pushed me out of the window in the first place --
oh , yeah ? well , if you hadn ' t shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
who is he ?
some limey . he ' s a middle-man for somebody . he doesn ' t say and i don ' t ask .
`` . for my father . ``
i ' m so sorry .
<person> , i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass .
that ' s a very apt analogy , helena . now , go home and be with your children .
i ' m sorry i left you hanging up there .
it doesn ' t matter . really . i ' m just sorry you got chewed out .
i ' ve been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy . i ' m actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console . this is a last resort . when somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy , we send in someone after them . a specialist , like myself .
i don ' t believe a word you ' re saying .
i ' m with you <person> .
this is <person> gekko . now . i want zip-locked mouths on bluestar , or i ' m gon na personally come down there and rip out your fucking throats !

the fact is . we ' d like you to give <person> another chance .
of course i ' m serious . i bought it , didn ' t i ?
this is so typical . i can ' t believe you . i ' ve barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?
i was in the middle of it .
i don ' t believe this . after the hartford fire and the hagenback- wallace wreck , that ' s the most famous circus disaster of all time .
scrambled or fried ?
<person> is eating eggs , sir .
but you ' ve got to let them know !
no , i ' m not going anywhere anymore , i ' ve had it with traveling . i quit .
<person> .
