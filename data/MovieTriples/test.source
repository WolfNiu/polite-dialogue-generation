isolate . isolate . i like this kind of talk . what the hell nonsense is that ?

morning , gentlemen . <person> me . afternoon .
<person> , damn , hurts looking at you .
<person> ' t you know anything about limo etiquette ? everything in here is included for our pleasure .

<person> . <continued_utterance> mrs . <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> a minute . i just want --
who are you ?
how do you spell that ?

something like that .
keep me abreast will you ? chief <person> is understandably nervous . situations like these tend to yield grief . and we ' ve the fbi poking around our garden patch .
scares the living daylights out of me .
who ?
look what we have here . <person> <number> - <number> on the mack .
<person> . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there ' s always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?
i ' ve been thinking .
what about ?
i ' ll never make it . can ' t we stop just for a few minutes .
we ' ve not gon na get to the cabin till after dark as it is , thelma .
thats a real jacket . by that , i mean a real stupid jacket .
this is a snakeskin jacket , and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom .
it ' s an instant-on world , isn ' t it ?
what ' s that for ? it feels cold .
you don ' t believe in anything do you , <person> ?
i believe in this moment , that ' s all . there is nothing else . come on . he must weigh <number> pounds .
where are you , <person> ? <person> ' t you move an inch , copper . nauls , bring me a goddamn flashlight !
somebody ' s taken it . i can ' t find it !
that , too , is in the folder .
<person> ' s get something straight here , <person> . i ' ve been <number> years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away . i spent almost a year on <person> alone , with the trial , the testimonies , the background investigations . i didn ' t come here today to look in your goddamn folders . in fact , i wouldn ' t have come here at all if you ' d done your job right .
well i guess <person> did it .
<person> ' s dead
hi .
hi , <person> ' <person> . you look old . <continued_utterance> this job ' s going to kill you . if i don ' t first . <continued_utterance> if you ' re home it means either jack and <person> have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you , or --
i have no idea . i have no freaking idea !
she ' s looking for a payout , dude . just buy her stake and give her an exit .
i mean it ' s summer time right , what could their audience be , five million ? most of them hardly pay attention anyway , right ? the point is , the book got on . it couldn ' t hurt sales , that much could it ?
of course not .
he sure walks like a girl .
and runs like one and talks like one and throws like one . probably takes a pee like one too -- just squats right down .
depends on how lucky i get . i ' ll only be coming around once , maybe twice a week .
you want to use your old desk ? someplace to sit down ?
she ' s not as nice as she seems on television .
you ' ve met her ?
<person> ! <person> , we was afraid-
you shouldn ' t ' ve killed mr . <person> . you shouldn ' t ' ve done that . it was wrong . i ' m takin ' you both in for it .

<person> ? and where are your parents ?
it ' s just my mother and me . she ' s back in columbus . she couldn ' t come .
now tell me , why would i want to do that ?
because i don ' t want to see him hurt .
are you all right ?
no . iandiacute ; m . i donandiacute ; t know if we can do this without <person> . <person> puts her hand lovingly to his face . <person> takes her hand .
<person> was <person> . <person> specialist . letac surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building . <continued_utterance> we don ' t know how , but <person> <number> . <number> made himself into an android .
you mean a nanotech synthetic organism .
is there anything you would like to tell me before we start ?
yes . i ' m going to kill you pretty soon .
or hemingway , when <person> lost all those stories .
he was never able to reproduce them .
you can make that shot .
the smart play ' s to lay up .

captain <person> , who died . captain <person> , who died in action today left you this . <person> , sergeant sam perkins .

maybe you should move back into the city ? get a new job . shake it up a bit .
accident .
you should be more careful . <continued_utterance> it ' s very nice of you to help me . that package is kind of heavy , and it ' s so hot .

what are you ? the world ' s first homeless united nations boy band ?
we ' re here , <person> , and that ' s all that matters .
you ' re right . that is all tha matters .
i don ' t want to remember .
do you understand that you hold the keys to this prison ?
cellular <number> connect . how may i direct your call ?
the learning academy . spring street .
because you wanted to . you wanted this to be your wedding not your parent ' s .
<person> ' t you dare .
why are you always afraid to get somewhere ?
this is not a good time to take chances . your best friend , <person> , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . we see him from time to time . he comes down to church for a free meal .
oh shit ! we sure as hell can ' t hand her the baby with an ass full of dope . right in front of the narcs ! <continued_utterance> what should we do ? i really got ta go .
<person> , she ' s just had her bottle . she ' s sleeping like a log . <person> ' s just leave her in the apartment . what can possibly happen to her ? she ' s as regular as clockwork . she won ' t wake up till <number> : <number> and we ' ll easily be back by then .
you left me to die , friend .
you managed alright .
<person> . next . <person> . your report ?
i regret to inform you , sir , that <person> is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war .
where did you get -- ?
it ' s mine to give . i didn ' t steal it .
oh , <person> !
what ' s happening ?
counting the what ? what does that have to do with the price of butter ?
i was just trying to make conversation .
<person> . is alive .
no way . no fuckin ' way .
who is it ?
you think i fear death ? i welcome it . i get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? she ' s beautiful isn ' t she ? you should have seen her before . <person> , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed .
<person> . i should have gone ahead and fucked her .
what did you say ?
not exactly .
i ' m a good woman to you , <person> . <person> ' t i always take care of you ? nobody cares for you like me . i ' m a good woman .
just . want to be ready when we do .
<person> for what ? sight-seeing ?
<person> marquez . ever hear of him ?
wha- no .
the alternative , mr . president , is that this could be a trap .
<person> a settlement , tie us down in negotiations , we come up short .
if you find out what i want to know , and if i ' m able to successfully use that information , you get to go back to your degenerate little life . if not , you take a bath .
you ' re one sick bastard . a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . i think no matter which way i go i ' m likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . so here ' s my answer : kiss my ass , hop-along . <continued_utterance> not bad for a gimp .
you need to see a doctor , mr . <person> . an internist . and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist , as well .
she told you about . . .
yes . and he ' s going to get away with it . <person> ' s momentarily speechless .
how do you know this ?
sure .
it was unintentional .
this is totally irrelevant .
oh , but it ' s not . if i hadn ' t been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , i never would have took off for new york . i never would have met <person> , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .
no . why ?
i don ' t know . i just assumed .
do you know what a wire transfer is ?
is she for real ? <person> , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
we were idealists .
because we believed we could make an impact out here . self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing .
everything alright ?
yeah .
we didn't do nothin special i can remember . just talked , is all .
talkins good . long as you got the other ? im a big believer in talkin , case you aint noticed .
not really . only a toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea .
is that so ? well , we ' ll see who ' s the goofy one .
we still have to get him to a hospital .
after we get a reading on the storm ?
hello . <continued_utterance> how is it that a man of god becomes a man of gold ?
trinkets for the ladies .
<person> step . through the office . <continued_utterance> <person> step . out the door . <continued_utterance> it works !
of course .
never turn your radio off ! i thought i was gon na find you scalped ! damn it !
<person> , <person> . i lost <person> --
ok , so that ' s two lefts , and then a right , huh ?
<person> .
oh , it ' s you ! what do you want ?
. <person> to apologize . i .
no you ' re not . <continued_utterance> the iraqis are that way . those are our troops you ' re shooting at . <continued_utterance> you know what ? i think you got schwarzkopf . you did ! you got the general right in the ass . now that ' s good shooting .
blow me .
<person> ' ites , i think .
is that good , or bad ?
. no more than i need remind you , minister , that merely being a member of the lucky sperm club - does not preclude one from a life of criminal activity . <continued_utterance> the reason i invited the minister here , <number> , was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion .
of course .
so it ' s the rockettes , so what ?
and you ' re just sitting there like that ?
<person> ' t .
<person> ' t ? you ' ve really scared me . is that what you wanted ? is that what you wanted ?
<person> lay odds ?
you would lose . you must excuse me .
you have a key ?
yeah . i ' ve just never needed it . will you talk to my father ?
what took you so long ?
what do you want , <person> ?
indulged him ? i have indulged him ? <continued_utterance> he ' s a grown man who makes his own decisions .
but he does not need to buy it .
let me share something with you . <continued_utterance> <person> is a snake . that woman broke up so many homes and caused a lot of misery and because she calls herself getting religion everything is put right .
these damn things are unloaded , ain ' t they ?
here ' s my license .
i ' m afraid i ' m going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment . the narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now . they want to ask you a few questions .
not that isolated .
well , maybe not that isolated .
why --
no , no -- now don ' t tell me . they -- they don ' t understand you at home . they don ' t appreciate you . you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
<person> , mrs . <person> .
right . <person> , lem me tell you something . with a child you always know who the mother is , but the father -- that ' s another kettle of fish . so don ' t give me that bullshit , okay ?
you ' re stoned .
she ' s still a transvestite .
i find it hard to believe myself .
his lips , unused as they are to such a contortion , twisted and stretched . into a smile .
oh . i almost forgot . there is one last thing : before <person> retired , he asked that i give you one other protective device .
a wedding band ? ? ? what am i supposed to be able to do with this ?
because they ' re very well-funded raving psychotics , and i ' m getting a lot of money . <continued_utterance> you think i care about their cause ? or yours ? not at all . <person> , america is on top now . . . but so was rome , once . all civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and . living well takes money .
you ' re damaged goods , lady .
i ' m sorry .
um . have you thought at all about what i said ?
we ' ll find our way .
how ! ?
<person> ' t leave me . i want to say with you , <person> .
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again ?
from the sun . it ' s a reflection on the glass .
it ' s her ! i ' m telling you . she whispered and turned on the music . she ' s trying to contact me !
what ?
do you still love me ?
thanks , but i ' ve got to be going . unfortunately , <person> , this isn ' t a social visit .
what ' s up ?
<person> ever come out here ? <continued_utterance> i say something funny ?
no . but i mean . just the idea that mr . <person> would .
i think she ' s lying .
me , too .
iraqis .
oh , <person> !
take a look at this crap .
irs ? they ' re not gon na leave me alone !
god give you this road ?
no --
. and i have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones . they change them every twenty-four hours but i have a contact at mextel who can get me the new esns within twelve .
that ' s good shit .
<person> ?
i ' ve got to move . what do you have , <person> ?
<person> .
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn ' t get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
what the hell ' s going on ? !
this is my area of expertise .
he comes here every night to see <person> .
big on the musical comedy , huh ?
he says he ' ll tell us everything he knows if we protect him .
tell him fine .
you ' re stalling , verbal .
give a guy a break , huh ?
can the gods really be so cruel ?
i don ' t think that ' s cruel . it ' s just practical . if everybody was rich , who ' d wait on us ?
forgive me for attempting a romantic gesture .
<person> ? try stalkerish .
did you just make that up ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t write a page when a paragraph will do .
you don ' t deserve me , you know .
<person> . <person> i ' m late .
indeed . please . <continued_utterance> thanks for your time on a sunday .
i ' m not going to let this baby die .
<person> ' t make me kill you .
i don ' t care who she marries , but i don ' t want her marrying you !
why don ' t we just talk about this in a nice , rational manner .
if i can .
i ' m trying to bust the tijuana cartel .
why are you actin ' like this ?
<person> ' like what ? ! how am i supposed to act ? ' scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody ' s head off !
because i won ' t .
<person> , why are you so hostile towards the poor man ?
what the hell are you doing ? you could ' ve killed me !
i heard you talking . i could tell where you were in the room .
i ' m not really sure . i fell in love with <person> . all i want is to be with her . the rest is all a big misunderstanding .
<person> , you ' ve stolen , vandalized , trespassed , and burned down <person> . all for one girl . if there ' s a misunderstanding , it ' s with your insight into females .
no ? why not ?
you just wouldn ' t . it ' s not the amish way . but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night .
what ?
we ' ve gone insane .
i can tell .
you ' re a helluva translator .
got it . nice touch . <person> , pick me up at eight . the de-brief is at ten hundred .
hey , hey , hey . what are we forgetting ?
yes . i ' m going to kill you pretty soon .
i see . how exactly ? <continued_utterance> well , i thought i ' d break your neck , then use you as a human shield , then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun . <continued_utterance> and what makes you think you can do all that ?
just now .
yes .
maybe i ' ve been mistaken for somebody else . <continued_utterance> a guy with the same name as me in time magazine . it ain ' t a common name so i looked out for it . but the day it came out , every newstand was sold out . no library had it . i even wrote off for a back-issue . never seen a copy to this day . <continued_utterance> maybe i ' m being set up for something . you ever feel like that , <person> ? like your whole life has been building to something ?
a coincidence . <person> ' t you ever heard of a coincidence ?
the one girl i really wanted , and you took her from me . you ' re insane . you ' re losing it , man .
you have revealed yourself .
about $ <number> less than the same week last year .
that could be a fluke , right ?
no . hell , no . <person> got in the truck , started drivin ' , looked down at the gauge and saw a big `` e '' starin ' at me .
you know what that big `` e '' stands for ?
we both auditioned for the philharmonic . one cello position open .
do we have to ?
should i discount ?
it ' s about a man on a quest for knowledge who meets a woman he can not resist .
three . you ? <person> ?
no .
no .
hiking ?
<person> <number> . insights into my soul .
yes . well . <person> ' t compete with that .
hi .
<person> .
that on your ' <person> . ' to read all those books ? <continued_utterance> <person> . maybe i want to try being positive . <continued_utterance> maybe i miss doing that dumb play with you . <continued_utterance> maybe you inspire me .
that sounds like horseshit .
she said , `` you know . `` that i know .
do you ?
hey , <person> .
oh . hi , <person> . you scared me .

well , there ' s only one thing to do .
no , no , no , i ' ll be fine . i ' ll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning .
this is why <person> is so interested in cleaning up tijuana . <person> , who ' s supposed to be dead , owns him . and <person> is making a move on <person> .
<person> ! come on . <person> ' t pull this you don ' t care bullshit . this is incredible information . it must be .
well , for example , we ' ve spent a fortune developing existenz , but we all know it ' s a risky project . she might have to make changes . it ' s the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem .
a problem with her new game ?
oh , concrete , my favorite town .
and stop that .
<person> , no , i ' m not . i ' m not <person> . poor <person> . i wish i could help you .
i hate him , i hate it . sometimes i love it . but now i ' m afraid . i am so afraid .
well , good thing i stole this from the bookstore then . <continued_utterance> i was reading it all last night . <person> , having sex is a lot more complicated than i thought . did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole ?
you lie .
it ' ll be too dark to make our way back now . <person> ' s bed down for the night and head out at first light .
what about the gold ?
busca triquitraques ?

you girls are in some hot water .
i got the scholarship and he went nuts . he ' s crazy , and i ' m leaving . i ' m leaving !
great . go !

if you ' re even thinking about leaving me down here , you better think again .
i ' ll bring them to you .
you ' re not leaving here <person> .
she seems to be very shy . it never occurred to me that a big star would be shy .
she spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games . i think she ' d like it best if she never had to show them to anybody .
i don ' t recall asking you for advice . women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie --
actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot --
i ' d settle for being alive . really .
<person> , is that a sand dune .
my fight ' s not with you , holiday .
i beg to differ . we started a fight we never got to finish .
i flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful .
you know what would be really useful ? do you still have that friend at ligo ?
what ! this stupid obsess .
i think i ' ve been . i vaguely recall .
time is of the essence .
<person> . how much time ?
have you gone crazy ? you are not <person> . you aren ' t as good as <person> . they are moving the trial to a high security location . the press has gone berserk . the jury will be influenced . stay out of things . let us try to win the case .
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .
do you care to share a cab ?
oh yes , thanks -- that ' s really nice of you .
what is it ?
ah , yeah , hi . is tina there ?
look at these balls . <person> new titleists . <person> ' em , every one a brand new titleist . sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance . we swipe enough free shit we might even pay for this fiasco .
you think it would be inappropriate to ask <person> for an autograph ?
what ? well , for chrissake , we could have made a stand at our place ! we had food , water .
you can ' t fight ' em that way .
<person> .
my parents sleep in separate beds .
a car , huh ? like a big armored car ? need something bigger , tougher . our truck maybe . or , hell , that old semi trailer !
its tires are flat .
what happened to <person> ?
couldn ' t make it . splitting headache .
is that right ? well , listen to this : drag your ass . this is a restricted area .
no , this is the home of the oglala sioux and i want the dog-fucker who killed <person> . whether you get him or i get him , i just want him . <person> ' s been goin ' on too long .
i was ready to go . i was proud to go .
i wanted to go .
i forgave you the moment you said it .
you did . well . thank you .
did you pork her <person> ?
no . but i wanted to .
at-at-at-at-at .
will you knock it off ! <person> , man . you ' re going to annoy the iraqis into submission .
no matter . he ' ll have to know how close we came .

i don ' t know , thelma ! i don ' t know ! just shut up a minute so i can think .
and you moved to new york . to dance and paint and act and deal arms .
right . do you want to hear <person> . or <person> ?
i changed my mind . gim me the three wood .
you can ' t clear the dogleg with a three wood .
about what ? how to improve your breast stroke ?
actually , i was curious about how you see things working out , for you , <person> and <person> .
this is a snakeskin jacket , and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom .
. <person> .
<person> ' t do it , ted . <person> ' t do it .
any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
incredible . we should take a drive before they ' re gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
<person> for antiques .
you ' re quick . i like that .
you think you ' re working with chimps here ?
hm .
my god , i wear the same scent as a transvestite . she is a transvestite , isn ' t : she ?

<person> .

hi , this is <person> . <person> and i got cut off .
i ' m sorry , <person> , but dr . <person> just called and instructed me not to put you through .
bad examples . <person> , <person> , i don ' t want to depreciate the loss here , but perhaps -- in a sense- this -- is for the best . <person> ' s eyes shift , study crabtree .
kind of a sign , you ' re saying .
no one must know ! especially him . you must appear to live your life normally , conveying nothing . the security of this nation depends on it . can you do that ?
i think so .
and again , and again , and again .
<person> to disturb you guys , but i ' m splitting . i didn ' t come here to be a bedwarmer . ' bye .
i said sit down . who do you work for ?
kettleman , <person> and mcgrath .
one job , that was the deal . mcmanus take it as it comes , brother . <continued_utterance> this is bullshit .
what is it <person> ?
back off five minutes , my ghetto brother . <continued_utterance> what ' s with the man size crast ? <continued_utterance> you running with the family jewels ? <continued_utterance> you rob a bank this morning , <person> ? <continued_utterance> least yo learned something tonight <person> honey ?
yeah , like how to quit mouthing if you wan na avoid drama .
gee , <person> , that sounded so heartfelt . i don ' t know whether to swoon or smirk .
really , <person> , i .
. and there ' s no truth that <number> % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?
no sir ! i swear ! this is not true ! !
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle . he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble . his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing . and he couldn ' t swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn ' t get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver . i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . <person> ! it just stuck up there and spread out . it was about the size of a half dollar . and that ' s why i don ' t ever eat fish eyes . he plays the guitar for <person> . then stops . truman i ' m not saying it ' s right or wrong , it ' s just the way i feel . it ' s the custom thing i was thinking of . in america we don ' t use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides . we throw away the tail , the rest of the insides and the head .
i understand .
it should be . it ' s yours . i want our debt forgiven . i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states . and i want the principle witness against my husband , <person> , killed .
perhaps . perhaps . i ' m afraid i must first ask you to pass a test . i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors . <continued_utterance> take this back with you . deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal .
can we just talk this out ?
talk what out ? we are locked and loaded here . we are non-refundable . i ' ve got relatives on the airport right now ! i ' ve got . <continued_utterance> answer it !
unfortunately , i would be of little assistance to the junior assistance league . particularly if my purpose were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking .
and what do you really want me to say ?
i ' ll do some this afternoon .
no , i need to take them with me .
okay , we ' re on the last present now .
last present !
do what you want to do .
<person> , what the fuck are we doing here ?
it ' s wonderful . the lake . the trees . the little town .
do you know what the point of a vacation is ? do you understand the meaning of the word ?
i love this place . <person> ' t turn around . <continued_utterance> you were followed by the police , but they won ' t hear us over the children . i want to use a bomb .
you ' re kidding . <person> ' t you shoot him or something ?
i ' ve scheduled a medical for you .
it ' s barely a scratch . the dome broke my fall .
-- because they hadn ' t done any work in six weeks .
<person> ' t you late ?
<person> .
oh , well , some people have all the luck . everyone in the family is fine here . <person> had the mumps , which is no joke at eleven years of age -
you remind me of my daddy , you know ? <person> told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies . he had a long nose , too , like theirs . did i ever tell you how he died ?
in a fire , as i recall .
can ' t . i can ' t get a signal here . he receives this news with a strange calm . girl what about yours ?
i don ' t have a cell .
where were you when i was flunking freshman physics ?
so . does your family do the whole traditional christmas thing ?
what are they doing here ?
well , it ' s iraq . i ' m not sure , but i ' m guessing that has something to do with them being here .
call the police .
it ' s too late .
the ticket is <number> . <number> . bobby i bought a beer . that was a dollar something . then i gave that girl <number> cents for the juke box . and the blind man . the soda . i . i ' d have <number> if . if . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry , sir . it ' s $ <number> . <number> for the ticket . bobby yeah . just a little short . figures . i just wanted to get out , that ' s all .
<person> , ma ' am , you don ' t understand ! i
i don ' t know .
<person> -- listen to me . i ' m going home , then i ' m booking a flight to dallas . i ' m getting you a ticket , too .
you ' re getting it done .
because i hate wearing glasses .
what the hell does that mean ?
if he falls behind by fifteen points it ' s a technical fall . they get five team points . if that happens the score would be tied but we ' d lose the match on criteria .
there ' s some kind of cellular breakdown . it ' s completely edematous . <continued_utterance> and there ' s been no autopsy performed . there ' s no y incision here ; no internal exam .
you ' re telling me the cause of death on the report is false . that this man didn ' t die from an explosion , or from flying debris .
you know this used to be my room ?
yeah . do you want it back ?
because my opinion threatens yours , it ' s poorly developed ?
no , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes <number> % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .
the wind plays tricks with the noise - it ' s moving away from us .
i can hear it , grandpre , and there is no wind . you shouldn ' t lie to me .
we lost .
bummer . your noon canceled so you just have a <number> : <number> and <number> pm .
i have no frickin ' idea . i ' ve been trying everything .
have you told <person> ?
she had it , before she drank herself to death . <person> ' t exactly a love child .
<person> . then you ' re not her grandmother .
no ! help ! stop !
where are they ? where did they go ?
they don ' t know that ! it was just you and me there . i ' ll say he raped me and you had to shoot him ! i mean , it ' s almost the truth !
it won ' t work .
maybe i should put in my order now .
what ' re you talking about ? you ain ' t got a pot to piss in .
mexico ? you going to mexico ?
i ' m leaving . you never have to see me again . just please , give me the ticket !
boy , sweetie , this is weird , okay .
i know . i kept walkin , i headed for your house , only it wasn't your house , really . you let me in only you werent real pleased to see me . you kept askin , whyd you come to see me now ? why now ? like itd been a long time since wed seen each ohter .
what do i need a fancy suit for . i don ' t hobnob with the jet set . i just fix their planes .
. then buy yourself a decent bowling jacket so when you take <person> out you don ' t look like the roto rooter man . come on , for godsakes , that ' s what money ' s for . enjoy yourself .
good morning . <person> , is it ? you are the yankee they talk about ?
i thought i was the <person> .
oh yes , i remember you .
<person> took us apart , but i knew it would bring us back together .
i ' m here for you , <person> . anytime .
i love you , mom .
perhaps . perhaps . i ' m afraid i must first ask you to pass a test . i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors . <continued_utterance> take this back with you . deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal .
that ' s crazy . my husband is on trial for smuggling .
<person> ! what are you doing ?
shut up ! c ' mon .
it ' s within the realm . he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning .
i think i might have .
but they look good on you .
how do you know ? i don ' t wear them outside my dorm .
every time i listen to <person> , i always remember when i used to work in atlantic city back in the late <number> ' s . you know , a busboy job . <person> used to play at the <number> <person> , and we used to take our dates and say , ' hey , you wan na go and hear <person> ? ' then we ' d just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music . i think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown .
i ' d go with you and lean against the door . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got a pretty good aim .
<person> ? oh that ' s cute , referring to her as a package ! <person> , you can tell <person> she ' s a lousy stinking bitch .
<person> ?
the man at the inn . what did he want ?
justice . <person> . <person> .
relax . if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert .
they wouldn ' t do it in front of all these people . they ' d send someone later , when we ' re alone . <continued_utterance> away from the car . now !
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break <number> bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance . it ' s insane , i can ' t take it anymore .
i ' m having fun , what ' s the problem ?
i didn ' t invite you , <person> .
<person> , that was a little weird -
he left ? what do you mean ?
he left out the window .
what is this , <person> .
<person> . <person> of miners out here got their own claims , from way back . <person> ' s buyin ' em all up , says he ' s gon na cut off the air an ' water if they won ' t sell .
what do you want to listen to ?
slow down , man .
no . i know he ' s there .
is the house locked up ?
he ' s missing . his home was broken into at some point within the last hour .
so send <person> .
you really ate the fruit ?
one bite ! what ' s the big deal ?
<person> : i think it should be .
. but we don ' t tend to focus on that aspect of it , right off the bat --
sure . how are you ?
i ' m well .
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot . shelly , i know where everything in this house is . sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is .
lay off the bennies , <person> .
apparently , you kept repeating it last night . you did sleep , <person> , and your advisor said you cried out , you had a nightmare .
everything is a nightmare --
you wanted to know what happened after the line-up , i ' m telling you .
oh come on , verbal . who do you think you ' re talking to ? you really expect me to believe he retired ? for a woman ?
sure . and i ' m supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasn ' t his idea either .
that was all fenster and mcmanus .
you told that thievin ' little shit where we were goin ' ? !
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up . i asked him not to tell . i didn ' t think he would tell anybody .
i can ' t believe you called <person> . what ' s the matter with you ?
i ' m scared , that ' s what . i ' m scared there ' s no one to trust .
the pages are gone . that ' s real .
maybe .
twelve miles east of here .
why ?
mr . <person> , <person> . i ' ve come all the way from minneapolis to shake your hand , sir . <continued_utterance> stuck in this chair i do nothing but read . newspapers , mostly . usually i ' m just looking for something -- anything -- that ' ll tell me there ' s even the slightest chance i ' ll walk again .
i really don ' t know what to say .
that ' s right . what are you doing here ? this is a religious ceremony you ' re desecrating .
we ' re fbi , <person> . we just need to ask you a few questions .
what am i going to do ? my only son will be sent to prison ! <continued_utterance> oh , lance , can ' t something be done ?
tell you what , estelle . i ' ll make out that <person> reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire . it ' ll be less suspicious . but i could take some serious heat for this .
draw swords !
good luck , my friends .
it looks pretty green for this climate .
<person> ' s dry about an inch down . somebody just laid this down . <person> recently , i ' d say .
where did you meet him ?
i can ' t even remember . the day i turned thirty i wandered into the over thirty room for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting .
what about ?
eternal recurrence . maybe it wouldn ' t be so bad .
everyone is breaking up . you . me . this other person i know broke up with someone in an elevator . i think it was in an elevator . or just outside it . or after it . it got stuck . i think . and suddenly everything became clear . when i saw you , at the coffee place , i was waiting for him and i was --
-- charming .
long as you keep your dick out of it --
me an ' the ' big guy ' have an understanding . he ' s gon na lie low till i get in the open -- then .
why won ' t you let me contact <person> ? they ' ve got to be going crazy , wondering what ' s happened to you . i mean , it ' s not like we ' ve done something wrong . we just ran because we didn ' t know how many of them there were , right ? i think we owe it to <person> to let them know you ' re all right , to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he ' s doing . and besides , i can ' t . i can ' t just keep doing this , whatever it is , you know , forever , not having any idea when it ' s going to be . <continued_utterance> hey , what are you doing ?
where ' s your bioport ? <person> ' t tell me you were never fitted . i can ' t believe it .
<person> move .
did you get the new cadillac ?
<person> kelly . i thought we might get a bite --
not hungry .
well , i can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement , but .
well -- brian ? i understand what you ' re saying , and i think it ' s great . i do . because there ' s a lot of things around here that could use some attention . believe me . but i ' ve honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes , and if i take the time out of my lunch hour .
at least we know where the gold is .
<number> hours . they ' ve already sailed from the persian gulf .
my husband had been working on something he called , the project for the children . are you aware of this ?
i don ' t know . perhaps i remember something .
like ? uh . hmmm . well .
i got this guy who should know tells me buy <person> but i been burned on tips . what do you think <person> ?
you must have done something to her .
since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .
<person> ' s right around the corner .
that one ' s closer .
<person> . i wouldn ' t say that around the locker room .
what the hell are you doing anyway ?
ow ! ow ! it ' s broken in two or three places !
that ' s just the impression you have ! i tell you it ' s only shock ! <continued_utterance> take it easy , boy !
it hurts .
<person> ' t push too fast ! <person> ! the hard part is over . you can see the top of the head .
what ' s this ? <person> speaks ? of course i have the hots for her and i ' m doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till i kick <person> ' ass and show her i ain ' t who she thinks i am because , in fact , i am who she thinks i am but if i win the open i won ' t be .
well , i don ' t think her nor me nor the god of golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the open .
like i said , open container , <person> . i . , misdemeanor possession . <person> to make it disappear . for you , poof , it ' s gone . <continued_utterance> one thing bothers me . that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he ' s lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what ' s your daughter on ?
i don ' t know what you mean .
but .
no buts . i told you your friends were <person> .
what obscene words ?
' fuck you . '
. it adds up <person> , <number> here , <number> there . your brother never . . well , i always said money is something you need in case you don ' t die tomorrow .
how ' s <person> ?
get up out of the chair , and walk toward the backdoor , <person> .
i get thrown in solitary until i don ' t know my own fuckin ' name , and then you people tell me i can beat nine years if i help you . i helped you !
you ' re not as smart as i thought you were , buddy boy , <person> hard -- don ' t count on graham and <person> to make you a fortune , everybody in the market knows the theory , ever wonder why fund managers can ' t beat the sandp <number> ? ' cause they ' re sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered . i been in the business since ' <number> . most of these high paid mbas from harvard never make it . you need a system , discipline , good people , no deal junkies , no toreadores , the deal flow burns most people out by <number> . give me pshs -- poor , smart and hungry . and no feelings . you don ' t win ' em all , you don ' t love ' em all , you keep on fighting , and if you need a friend , get a dog , it ' s trench warfare out there sport . and in here too . i got twenty other brokers out there , analyzing charts . i don ' t need another one . <person> to you sometime .
i ' m not just another broker mr . <person> . if you give me another chance , i ' ll prove it to you . i ' ll go the extra yard for you . one more chance . please .
has anybody asked his wife ? she ' s the one i hope did it .
<person> , just cut the bullshit , will ya ? do have any ideas or don ' t ya ? i been standin ' in this stupid parkin ' lot all goddamn night , and i still got to go file a report before i can go home in time to get back up again !
<person> with me and the secrets of the west are yours .

a strange threat . i can only assume you ' re here to kill me anyway . pity about mr . <person> . mcmanus fair trade for <person> . <continued_utterance> ahh , mr . <person> . do join us .
well , i was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield . that makes me the real hero . <person> ' t it , <person> ?
big stomach . big mouth .

you dreamed you ' d never see me again .
i left your house . i went to the car , and my friend the stalker had been following me .
aw shoot . my cell battery ' s dying . <continued_utterance> <person> , i must have left the charger in the other car . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> you want me to pick up something for you while i ' m here ? <continued_utterance> no . i ' m just . i mean i ' m . oh nothing .
your phone ' s breaking up <person> . i ' m not joking when i say it ' s packed over here .
that ' s a long fucking ways . gim me another ball .
<person> .
<person> , right , it ' s a game system .
and we ' re worried that it ' s too intellectual , too complex , too weird , too artsy . that argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans . she hates to be rejected in the flesh , so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat .
and i ' ll take your father ' s farm and give it to working men who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company .
no , please . <person> , you can ' t do that .
really ?
yeah . <person> ' ll make me leave school if i screw up the play .

<person> ' t that what you came here for ?
not right now . it ' ll take too long . <person> ' s an hour away . we ' ll drop him off after we ' re done here . <continued_utterance> look at him , he ' s fine .
<person> ! heimdall ! i know you can hear me ! open the bridge !
we shouldn ' t be putting him off the boat .
the guy ' s out of control .
well . yeah . you looked great . why aren ' t you partying ?
in a minute .
i ' m not worried . you ' re not worried , are you . professor tripp ?
i ' m a little worried , <person> .
oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
you still call him boy . you call <person> boy in front of his wife and son .
my daddy called me boy up to the time he died . i was always boy to him .
i don ' t think we ' ve got to take drastic action . <continued_utterance> thought i ' d come by and get things off my chest . talk it out . <person> , i ' m going over to pimlico . catch the seventh race . wan na come ?
i can ' t get away from work .
about nine more hours .
we can ' t learn anything from this .
it will come . in time . <continued_utterance> if it ' s any consolation , i think you ' re right . about the frost giants , about <person> , everything . if a few of them could penetrate the defenses of <person> once , who ' s to say they won ' t try again . next time with an army ?
yes , exactly !
where ' s my white on white shirt ?
it ' s like yelling through a wall to you . i ' m carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are , and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is .
but if you could , you would ?
yes .
just watching you .
i got that . how was your day ? <continued_utterance> you all right ?
look at him .
what ' s he doing ?
we ' ve got blood plasma in storage .
how long will it take you to prepare this ?
this is nice , out here , the two of us .
<person> , it ' s great .
well it ain ' t mine , dear . he got that after the fighting at transvaal . after he ' d been hurt , and he ' d saved some other lads , and well . i don ' t know what else , he won ' t tell me either . but the first day he got home he just . tossed them out . first day he could walk , he threw `em straight in the dustbin , and wouldn ' t hear a word i said not to . <continued_utterance> see , what you done today , you and <person> , you ' re chuffed up now , and so you should be , my splendid boy . it ' s good to be proud when you done something good . but what he done , in africa , whatever it was , he takes no pride in it . <person> as it surely was , and however much pain it ' s cost him , he refuses to be proud of killing , i suppose .
i ' d be proud . if i ' d gone off to war . if i ' d gone and saved my mates , and -
no , stay . please stay with me .
<person> , i got ta start makin ' money .
sure kinko .
<person> ?

i saw you out there . you want him to call you back , need you .
no . i ' m glad i ' m home .
<person> ?
what ? !
yeah , okay .
well , i guess i ' ll be going now .
the reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
of the six prison inmates you ' ve tested all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only mr . <person> is still breathing .
and there are other costs to consider .
<person> will see that the children are provided for .
<person> . they ' ve eaten too much of the food ?
you are too young for war . and you ' re too young for women !

i know you got a wife and kids in there . i got a grand-daughter i haven ' t seen in three years and another i haven ' t even ever met .
why is that , <person> ? why is that ? do you remember having anything to do with that ? <continued_utterance> that shit you pulled . never again . and all the shit i saw growing up ? that doesn ' t happen here . <continued_utterance> take care of yourself .
load what you can ; water , tools , weapons . anything you think we might need .
who ' s he kidding ? he wants it as bad as we do . we ' re going to be fat , <person> . as soon as we get back to saudivillie you and me are going to --

i ' m a hard-working guy . i don ' t go around breaking windows .
why don ' t you read it ?
<person> ' t like telegrams . all them stops and stuff .
justice . <person> . <person> .

<person> ' t make me angry , <person> .

i am not common keith . i am not common . i am a creature like no other and i will not be commoned ! is that to much to ask ? is that to much to ask ! ? !
you will not be common ! ! !

what ' s that ?
it ' s my pink-fone . i ' m not sure i should answer it .
joined a rugby league . <person> out to be a bad idea . come here i want to show you something . <continued_utterance> look at this . i just noticed this today . <person> steps in close and studies the drawing . <continued_utterance> this is from the sentryman series . a color version of this was actually used in the second issue . <continued_utterance> look at this eyes . what do you see ? <continued_utterance> it ' s fear . he was scared . they were being honest in the beginning you see . they let him be human . they turned him into a garden variety hero later . then he was brave all the time . <continued_utterance> i followed the guy in the army jacket . <continued_utterance> he had a silver handled gun tucked in the back of his pants . were you really injured in that car accident in college ? <continued_utterance> because i think you faked it . i think you took the opportunity to end your career - no questions asked . and i think you did it , of all things , for a women . not only do you have the physical traits of a hero , down somewhere in there , you have the moral code of one too . you were ready to sacrifice everything for what ' s right . where can you find that these days ? only thing you didn ' t realize is that you were giving up a part of yourself when you gave up football . the physical part . and you need that part desperately to feel balance again . you can have it back now . this was all just make believe before . what if there was someone the opposite of me ? what if ? . i now believe you are the genuine article mr . <person> dunne . the kind of person we knew existed , from our history . <continued_utterance> it ' s time for someone like you . bad is winning . i can feel it . <continued_utterance> that ' s not what i witnessed <person> .
stop messing with my life <person> . my son almost shot me last night . he wanted to prove you were right .
<person> ' t you want to know my name ?
i already know it , <person> .
oh , not
i ain ' t tellin ' you nothin ' ! get me <person> .
i wan na play a song on the juke . you got a quarter ? <continued_utterance> what happened to your hand ?
i cut it shaving ; i know , i got ta be more careful .
<person> , please .
<person> was so strong back then . working from the crack of dawn . so proud of his peaches .
i just mean , i -- i guess <person> isn ' t going to be there when you get home .
are you holding me up or am i dragging you down ?
know why you ' re here ?
way ahead of you , <person> . you want us to help you get <person> and <person> . everybody knows they ' re the ones to blame for your brothers .
except his was black and yours is white . and dirty .
see that . i was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast . but now i guess it ' ll just be her and me . you have your smart mouth to thank for that .
<person> ' to the u . s . open with the shanks . <person> na be chili dipping my way around the course on worldwide television . sure , relax .
i ' m gon na get rid of them shanks for ya . no hay problema .
oh . <continued_utterance> oh .
what ' s the matter , honey ?
<person>f course it is . but the president needs to realize we ' re going to have to stop a ship eventually .
the chiefs are looking for a provocation out there . the president ' s going to come under enormous pressure . you have to keep ' em on a short leash , <person> . mcnamara spares <person> a short , nasty look .
is that how do you explain what ' s happened to you ?
what --
one hand in front of the other son . we ' ll do it together . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t look down . look in my eyes !
i can ' t .
this is bullshit !
hey , <person> , listen -
it ' s a bathtub . what she ' s standing under . <continued_utterance> there ' s pop . let me see it . the gun . <continued_utterance> figures . it ' s like the kind of gun <person> would carry . in a little beaded purse ?
i ' d better go . i think i may have to rescue <person> .
pretty song .
<person> ' t tell him what happened .
you mean he withdrew .
not at first . he was still inside but he wasn ' t moving or anything . he said we had this secret . and that now he ' d be able to help me . because we were close . something like that . i don ' t know . it ' s hard to remember , exactly .
you ' re lucky i am not wasting you .
well , little fella , let me put it this way . the operative word here would be `` federal '' . with or without the semantics of all this , i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning <person> , both while living and deceased .
. you could get me money . i ' ll get you out of here .
there ' s money . a lot .
in case there ' s some escaped psycho killer on the loose , who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us .
oh yeah , sure , thelma , that lantern will come in real handy . maybe we could tow your car behind , in case he steals the spark plugs .
interview ?
<person> ' s coming tomorrow to talk about his book .
back off , just go away you klutz . <person> , here ' s the story . the items in these cases belong to me . i designed them , built them , and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up .
i stole your beat , huh ? guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people .
regional ? !
nah , district .
whistling ? i ' m not whistling .
well someone is .
what did you tell him that for ?
you don ' t know what it ' s like . i think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth .
darling , don ' t cry .
i didn ' t know he was going to make that announcement , i swear i didn ' t .
what you do is take vengeance ! <person> is a sin against heaven !
that ' s your way , not mine .
under a hundred .
you want to stick around here , <person> ?
but not the timing of the matter . i intended to address them myself , explain the situation .
your majesty , france is on the brink of war . we dare not hesitate .
keep your voice down .
i will not . <continued_utterance> maybe you ' re right . maybe i ' m losing my mind .
a little more confidence there , <person> .
i wish <person> was here . i ain ' t cut out to do this . i ' m a spectator by nature . an observer .
what is it ? it ' s genocide , that ' s what it is . it ' s a pay zone for some u . s . corporation and a dead zone for the people here . <person> , <person> .
<person> . what are you doing ? what the hell were you doing out there ? <continued_utterance> this was a selective operations <person> , <person> . there is classified information pertaining to our national security . you don ' t question that , you don ' t go digging into that shit -- that ' s insubordination . <person> --
<person> : gim me a cuesta-ray .
oh shit , what ' s today ?
so you ' re the one who let us into <person> .
you ' re welcome .
we ' re gon na give this baby a bath .
<person> ' s right . there ' s not enough time to finish plowing . we ' ll lose everything and i ' ll end up working in the mines .
i don ' t give a damn .
about anybody but yourself . you never have .
now i was trying to be nice , to make conversation , since we go back some .
i was quoting from the bible . if the shoe fits , wear it .
how so ?
let ' s look at it this way , what if i can sell you this job at a wholesale price . kind of lessens the burden . the big boss won ' t get so angry , and maybe won ' t throw the guy ' s wife and kids out . at least they ' ll have a roof over their heads .
you heard me . my friend here has a bioport problem .
a bioport , now , that ' s a sort of a hole in your spine , isn ' t it ? lotta assholes `round here , but that ' s generally it . i don ' t know why you ' d be talking to me about that , lady .
- but as i ' ve explained to <person> , without proof , there ' s just no story . <person> ' t you agree mr . <person> ?
but i have proof ! you ran out of here so fast , i didn ' t get to show you .
lets leave here .
were goin to , <person> , real soon .
they ' re going to be pressing for a military solution soon . we can ' t afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats . we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here .
we got a bunch of smart guys . we lock ' em up together in there , kick ' em in the ass til they come up with options . <continued_utterance> i ' ll do it .
you don ' t think this was just a magnetic storm ?
if i ' m right , their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night ' s event .
it was really stupid .
<person> . it was stupid . you could have killed yourself .
ten minutes early .
i have another appointment at one .
<person> . <person> , <person> is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces . he
for what purpose ?
maybe the old man ' s visions are still strong .
do they come in dreams , these visions ?
hold her under her arms -- i ' m gon na try it this way . <continued_utterance> what the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers did you get ?
i don ' t think they ' re too big -- they ' re ultra-absorbent . that ' s all . the more absorbent the better .
there is no one older .
<person> ' t anyone age in this land of yours ? <continued_utterance> what ' s your name ?
' <person> ' m just like dynamite . and when i go off , somebody gets hurt .
<person> . i was making time with your girl . now i ' m scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?
it ' s <person> ' s daughter .
and why are you two taking care of her ?
did you find him ?
not yet .
the prostitute .
you fucked a prostitute ?
they didn ' t want me when i was born . why should i care .
<person> .
we left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed .
then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot .
hi . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t know if you left yet .
no -- i ' m leavin ' tomorrow .
what about us ?
well , i --
<person> . <person> was vice president , i believe .
that ' s probably not the problem , then . what about your lifestyle . any major changes recently ?
only there ' s no business like it , no business i know .
<person> , and there ' s no business as expensive . i ' m twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it ' s all because that rabbit can ' t keep his mind on his work .
you ' re sure we ' re not lost ?
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay ?
but .
we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we ' re out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .
you want to talk about fake ? how about guys who pretend to be from delaware to meet girls ?
how about we just stop talking altogether .
because . it was the biggest i ' ve ever seen . and i ' ve seen a lot on their way through <person> ' s <person> .
ms . <person> , did <person> rape you in your family ' s home on the <number> rd of april last year ? suzie glances at sam , hesitates . <continued_utterance> ms . <person> ?
it ' s so nice you could join us on such late notice .
oh , no !
all right . you go up , i ' ll send up the gold , then follow .
<person> . <person> , that ' ll work .
i have expectations , too .
i ' m not changing the rules .
i couldn ' t sleep .
little young for that , aren ' t you ? <continued_utterance> what shall i make you ?
i want you out by six thirty . understand . <person> comes at seven , i want you out by six thirty .
sure . would you like something for sleep ?
yes .
sometimes i wonder .
that ' s everything mr . <person> gave me .
the next book on that list ! the old man and . and .
but the others .
you can ' t help them now . your job is to survive . she struggles to sit up .
that ' s okay . thanks .
you know <person> ' s doing really well with wrestling here , <person> . the regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states .
is that the best shot we can get ?
what ' s to see ?
yes . i know .
and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
except the girl . the only one that really mattered .
and who might that be ? <person> ? <person> ?
if your neighbors didn't mind , howd you get put out of business ?
woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . she called the police and they came over and arrested me . thought i was a sniper ! boys at the vfw loved that one . <person> didn't understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . i was gon na put out poison , but i was afraid somebodys cat would eat it . <person> , i had six cats myself . so i used the . <number> because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap .
i ' ll take <person> to find rafael -- we ' ll go to sebaco on the road to matagalpa -- the guardia heavily control the area and they ' re scared right now -- they ' ll never let us through . we won ' t be able to get near rafael . <person> will understand -- and we ' ll turn around and drive back without a story .
that ' s a lie !
over-praise , i ' m afraid . but my people will finish the job .
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he didn ' t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .
why ?
why what ?
yes ?
is <person> in ?
what are we going to do with it ?
give it back to her mother , that ' s what .
i ' m glad this is working out .
you really happy ?
who do you think it is ?
the chancellor ' s here ? now ?
hey , big guy --
<person> ' t i get a hello ?
i know , but i ' m a mess . worse than usual .
<person> , if this is an emergency , go to the emergency room . if not , call dr . <person> and i ' m sure he can help you .
i have trouble sleeping . while i ' m lying in bed i figure them out . the stories .
you cold , <person> ?
you ' re going to let her just wait there ?
yes . yes i am . that ' s exactly what i ' m going to do . why not ?
you are so sweet to that guy , you really are . <person> not wanting to drag him into this . he is a lucky man .
i didn ' t ask him to come ! it ' s like i said , thelma , he just loves the chase .
ever have one of those days where you decide something important about yourself ? you know , where you say , `` i ' m not just what i ' ve been programmed to be . i can do what i want , when i want , how i want , because i ' m my own person ? ''
you one of them new age assholes ?
the bravest man in france .
<person> advice for a shopkeeper . let alone a king .
who am i ?
i don ' t know .
i should be going anyway .
y ' hear anything you ' ll let me know ?
what ' s your problem ?
why ' d you jump ?
what do you want from me ? i ' m trying to be fair . but i can ' t keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .
then i ' ll write about you .
but <person> , i can ' t find him !
well , honey , just grab some other toy ! now c ' mon !
at pee dee , all you think about is the future , you know ? gettin out ? and what youll do and what youll think about when youre on the outside again .
i just think about things as they come up . i never been much of a planner .
i don ' t want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you ?
maybe i ' ve been mistaken for somebody else . <continued_utterance> a guy with the same name as me in time magazine . it ain ' t a common name so i looked out for it . but the day it came out , every newstand was sold out . no library had it . i even wrote off for a back-issue . never seen a copy to this day . <continued_utterance> maybe i ' m being set up for something . you ever feel like that , <person> ? like your whole life has been building to something ?
you can ' t quit , <person> .
i can , <person> . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --
we can ' t learn anything from this .
probably right . <continued_utterance> macready and i were listening to some of these cassettes on the way back . like you gentlemen to hear it .
i haven ' t got all night to wait here while you eat free food ! you ' ve got your warrant , arrest those girls !
now , we agreed to let them finish their show first .
i have learned to live with death .
countess , i ' m very grateful for what you ' ve done , but i can ' t stay here . i ' ve got .
no way ! i didn ' t eat anything , so why should i pay for mouse .
well , sometimes you ' ll eat more than he does , and it ' ll even out .
i take it , then , you ' ve failed to get him again . <continued_utterance> proceed with <person> .
but , sir .
you get down ! i ' ll take care of this fool !
no ! <person> ' t shoot ! he ' s hiding behind the nerve agent !
we have to go into bixby in the morning . the concrete blocks are in .
the con . ! oh my god .
this belongs to you . <continued_utterance> she taught me -- everything . she saved my life .
you ' re marrying again .
-- and i don ' t think it ' s hunting wild pigs and weaving baskets .
she wants to see you -- now .
well , sure .
. and is dumber than my hind end . like that <person> .
yes , i am confident that <person> will be taken into custody before the end of the year . but , you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force . we get a tip that he is one place , then we get there and he is already gone , having been warned by someone on our side .
hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem .
everyone has to follow his own plough . a man doesn ' t have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . city people don ' t give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . you don ' t plant old ways . . but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you . it ' s when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don ' t want it . you sell it to a stranger . you worked your whole life , for what ? i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm . all what we ' ve experienced has no meaning .
you ' re suppose to teach your children what you know . <person> , i don ' t have to worry about . <person> is a different story .
that ' s what i ' m trying to find out , signore .
you are a good detective .
solved the whiteman case with this .
that ' s what i heard .
no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident .
they will believe . they will all believe . <continued_utterance> you understand ? nobody can resist me . <continued_utterance> know what happens when a man is strangled ?
he wouldn ' t like a lot of things . hop in .
he seemed pretty upset this morning .
i just wanted the kid to see you --
well , now he saw me . now you saw me . ok ? now would you mind ?
israel doesn ' t have a king .
then what do they have ?
smashing ! welcome to the family , ted . you are going to breathe some new life into this place . you are going to set the world on fire ! you are going to . call me <person> ?
uh , sure . <person> .
i ' m not going anywhere , ted . you ' re the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams .
i decided to let <person> run the magazine . i need to go to college , learn a few things , you know . <continued_utterance> and i thought maybe i ' d take up boating . i ' ve always wanted to be a `` coxswain . ``
in some way i understand him doing it , i don ' t like it but i understand . but you ?
i ' d do it again .
i came in from my room .
we were suite mates .
just now .
you ' re not going to believe this -- i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story . . exclusive . eat your heart out .
you dare to challenge me ? you are not warriors . you ' re pigs ! <continued_utterance> you ' re all pigs !
mother ! no ! !
i said , ' i don ' t think so ! '
still not getting it .
sounds like a good one .
it ' s not bad .
expectations . they have no idea what amazing things could be theirs .
where were you just now ? what were you doing ?
this is all we have .
some weather we ' re having .
there ' s <person> . <person> kid .
got the touch ?
then i ' ll have a tuna sandwich .
now that ' s very flattering . tuna coming up . let me make you some warm milk . that ' ll help the insomnia .
someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart .
me ?
is this that girl from last year ?
did you know her ?
the turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you . you have brought it to <person> in your search for yourself .
and you ' re going to help me by reading my mind ?
probably .
you admit you ' re lying ?
what ' s the question nobody ' s asking ? why that building ? why not the federal building ?
the federal building was too well guarded .
i think nothing happens . you ' re dead meat . that ' s it .
you don ' t believe in anything do you , <person> ?
i don ' t have wrestling shoes .
<person> ' t worry about it . you ever wrestle before ?
maybe someday .
<person> , i ' ll tell you something that is the god ' s honest truth . i ' ve seen a lot of really beautiful girls . i mean a lot . but none of them make me feel like you do .
you ' re looking more like a butcher than a mechanic .
things do get kinda confused these days , don ' t they ? i ' m gon na go wash up . you two make yourselves at home .
please don ' t call me that . <person> ' t ever call me that again .
what ?
call him ?
call him . <person> ' t tell him anything . tell him you ' re having a wonderful time and you ' ll be home tomorrow night .
i don ' t know ! what ' s `` omnipotent '' mean ?
work with me -- i ' m just speculating here . <person> ' s call this force `` <person> '' ; and let ' s say this `` <person> '' is controlling everything . <person> wanted me to have the knowledge of good and evil .
isn ' t there something you .
that ' s not the question . it ' s over . do you think that it ' s my fault ? if i ' d . if i ' d . i never should have taken it . there was no way that i was going to win .
' what is a friend ? a single soul dwelling in two bodies . ' <person> .
<person> . <person> page .
every month .
you take good care of him .
i ' m sorry <person> .
there ' s no apology necessary .
huh .
do you know it ?
how old is he ? <continued_utterance> hey !
hey , <person> .
<person> and <person> ?
they ' re pretty pissed off . they ' ll do anything . now i got a way to do it without killing anyone : but like i said , they won ' t let me in without you .
you ' re out of your mind .
i ' ve been a cop for a while , <person> . it ' s hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . and then there ' s the love angle . i mean do you and <person> really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ? <continued_utterance> am i right , did <person> sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking <person> ? that ' s murder , <person> .
you must be wearing a mask you ' re laughing so hard behind it <person> . <person> ' s cut the `` sir '' crap . correct me if i ' m wrong , but when you took cnx electronics , you laid off <number> , <number> workers , <person> about <number> , <number> , that airline .
i could break you , mate , in two pieces over my knees , you know it , i know it , i could buy you six times ever , i could dump the stock just to burn your ass but i happen to want the company and i want your block of shares . i ' m announcing a tender offer at <number> tomorrow , and i ' m expecting your commitment .
hey , <person> .
hey , <person> . <person> , i ' ll take care of him . go ahead in , grab some coffee . we ' ll be back pretty quick .
call me <person> . <continued_utterance> thank you . <continued_utterance> i guess i ' m on , huh ? well , the simplest way to put it is , i have problems . i worry er , about diseases . i have trouble with toothbrushes . and i , er , i have problems moving .
<person> about moving .
<person> , i ' ve been getting phone calls , every fifteen minutes or so . i think it ' s a man . he ' s trying to scare me .
an anonymous caller ?
i know there ' s a plan for everyone , but sometimes i don ' t understand what the message is -- or what the point is .
there is no point . you live . you die . the end .
what if i ' m right , gloria ? what if i ' m right and <person> ' s wrong ? what do you do if you see a bad thing coming ? <continued_utterance> stick with me on this gloria . i need you .
and if the teeth aren ' t <person> ' s ? you ' ll give this up ?
there you go , <person> . just find the buried treasure , and you ' re a millionaire .
you think ?
here he is . he ' s my bull man .
all right . see this animal . this here ' s the stupidest goddamn animal on the face of god ' s good earth . here ' s your bull hook . you ' re gon na need it .
a little less than yesterday .
in other words , par for the course . how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?
<person> . are you sweet on <person> ?
no more ' n you are for that doctor lady .
someone else has it now .
that would indicate that it ' s the future .
do we have the range of <person> ' s plane ?
anywhere in this circle . iran , iraq , pakistan , syria , afghanistan .
yes . well . it ' s complicated , <person> . i think we should go now .
a low rumble freezes grady
what is it ?
i called <person> at princeton . he ' s sending me applications for prep schools . i need you to take me to seattle to take some entrance exams .
no . but it wasn ' t a dream -- it was a place . and you -- and you -- and you -- and you were there .
oh --
you know <person> ' s doing really well with wrestling here , <person> . the regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states .
that ' s great .
you really should put some maggots on those scratches . they look pretty deep .
i just want to know why you told me not to move , and you ran .
not to him , i ' m guessing .
by what right do you interfere ?
you ' re on somethin ' again , aren ' t you ?
<person> .
we got it back , that ' s all .
how did i get in the house ? how did i get into my bed ?
you ' re saying a white guy did it .
when <person> was dumped out there in the badlands , he was dropped on his back . our man made an effort to turn him over , onto his face . it ' s an old ind ' n belief that if a dead man is turned face down , his spirit won ' t leave . and in the killer ' s case , it won ' t come back and jump all over his shit . that ' s an ind ' n thing a white man wouldn ' t know . <continued_utterance> and that ' s the way it is . write it down . <continued_utterance> you laugh all you want , <person> . <person> tonight , i get my man .
oh sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap ? ! i ' ll be back just as soon as i can . ok ? i am not the kind of man that everyone says i am .
i know you ' re not .
morning , morning all . what have we got ?
the canadian prime minister wants to set a lunch -
are you done ?
damn right i ' m done . i ' m going to ask for a mistrial and i ' m going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case . i ' m going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass .
i ' m just trying to get an idea how much you ' re willing to pay .
four dollars . i want to pay four dollars a month .
-and why did i choose you for this ?
because i ' m a cop with a law degree , and you thought my legal-

of course not . have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? no you ain ' t . you have to take just one and fatten him up . when you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . if you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . you just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste . <continued_utterance> you just take one ; you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground .

<person> steps .
when you leave this office , don ' t think about everything you have to do to get out of the building , just deal with getting out of the room . when you reach the hall , just deal with the hall . and so forth . <person> steps .
how is that possible ?
tax dollars only cover that much .
it was a lousy thing to do , okay ? it was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband . but the fact is that i never would have met you otherwise . <continued_utterance> it was lousy . it was a disgusting , terrible thing .
what kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing ?
we can ' t stay here . even if that wasn ' t an iraqi soldier it ' s only a matter of time before some show up . get all the water you can carry , and we ' ll head out on foot .

and still not a thing to watch . <continued_utterance> . although it must be fun to have all those satellites .
. <person> <number> , ' if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to <person> ? she aspirated into her mask ?

like you don ' t know .
yes . say goodbye , <person> . <continued_utterance> yes , i ' m ready now .

remember this ?
is this that girl from last year ?
hi , <person> ' <person> . you look old . <continued_utterance> this job ' s going to kill you . if i don ' t first . <continued_utterance> if you ' re home it means either jack and <person> have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you , or --

why don ' t you call her back ?
well . it ' s an interesting problem . but i don ' t really know what to tell you . it ' s a little outside my personal field of expertise .

<person> , that ' s got to be pretty vexing .
<person> .

the eyes don ' t lie . all this has gotten to you , hasn ' t it , <person> ? you came in as <person> ' s girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun . now you don ' t like it so much , but you ' re in so deep you can ' t get out anymore . tell me if i ' m wrong , <person> .

yes . i do .
i need to know what i ' m working with ; what their boundaries are . their lives depend on it , and for that matter so does yours . we ' ve got to bring them together . make them a crew . we ' re as strong as our weakest link and i don ' t want to find that out the hard way . so , i will challenge them and they will come together .
the plague to end all plagues , <person> . a silent weapon for a quiet war . the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . they ' ve been working on this for fifty years . while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned <person> .
negotiating with whom ?
i don ' t know -- maybe- i don ' t think so .
<person> , hannah . you don ' t remember where that aunt worked , do you ? <person> ' aunt .
humboldt county ?

society demands swift justice . i ' ll take the secret to my grave .
<person> . you ' ll die for your crimes . nothing can stop that . but how you leave this world is up to you .
my help ? a great magician like you ? you don ' t need any help .
but you ' re a great swordsman ! <continued_utterance> you ' re not a warrior , <person> ! a warrior wouldn ' t lie there and do nothing ! he kicks <person> ' s boot and knocks his feet off the log . <continued_utterance> we ' re in trouble ! you ' ve seen the big army that ' s after us ! you ' re a fake ! you ' re a bum ! you ' re a -- you ' re a coward ! !
but . but where did i go wrong ?
<person> , boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man . a boy ' s whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed .
who ?
a very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you . iandiacute ; m not sure why , but until we find out , i must ask you to stay .
mr . <person> , i ' m investigating the murder of the woman found on the roof of your building . do you live alone there ?
do i live alone ? yes i do . do you live alone ?
because i ' m the mother , and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life ' til you ' re eighteen . seriously , we ' ve got no money . i can ' t buy you the moccasins .
i bet if you ' d promised <person> some moccasins he ' d of got ' em .

your first homicide , that ' s gon na happen , <person> .
i just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .
dink ?

come on , burt , we can ' t hold still long . they ' re damn smart and getting smarter by the minute .
that ' s fine . we ' ve got some new things to teach them .
every wharf-rat from here to hong kong knows what ' s on that boat and i ' m claiming it . one-third of that gold is mine .
that ' s fine , but - even a little london girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing .
hey , <person> , listen -
i want to be alone .

you love her , but you hate her ?

i know you ' re not .
i ' ll call you tonight .
<person> ' s he sitting in my car ? he ' s crazy , that ' s why . he probably calls everybody <person> .

his majesty , the king .

what do you mean ?
what makes you think i can do a better job than your people ?
mr . <person> says you ' re one of the smarter people he knows-
he didn ' t get to be <person> of the air force by being neighborly . <continued_utterance> everyone aboard young <person> ?
yes , <person> .
stand still . i want you to remember this in the morning .
if you want me to remember something in the morning , then tell it to me in the morning .
i have some errands to run , and then i thought we ' d spend the evening .
that ' s what i ' d planned to .
yes , you .
i -- i -- i -- i -- got ta get her outta there ?
well , i ' m definitely gon na be gone for a couple of days at least , sheila .
why do you have to stay so long ?
you use their witness .
that ' s right .
in the service you do , but we ' re not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we ' re doing , that doesn ' t particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
we been down this road . i told you how it is . unless you feel like there ' s something you want to do about it .
can ' t complain . got a house in <person> . <person> treating you good ? still seeing that sexy french gal ?
nah , she asked the wrong question .
the one in your office ? it ' s the best one . for naps .
i don ' t think it really matters , <person> . we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point . <continued_utterance> ail right . in my office .
you ' re a very odd girl .
you ' re a very odd fellow .
. and <person> lives in buffalo , with his wife and two sons , if you can believe it .
that is depressing .
same one they have all over .
they ' ll never prove it to me . and everything smells so beautiful . what is it - pine or fir ?
nickels and dimes . you got a good point there , bb . you ' re right on the money with that kind of thinking .
got ta find a new business to get into .
a peace officer . impressive man
yes , very . and very married .
what ' re you doing out here ?
fixing the mower . <continued_utterance> i saw my father on state street dressed as a homeless man . <continued_utterance> what do you want ?
<person> , buddy , some buddy ; why didn ' t you tell me to buy bluestar .
<person> , he demanded confidentiality .
exactly . then we wouldn ' t worry anymore .
hey , you ' re right !
you smell nice .
<person> ' t seen you since i was thrown out of one eyed <person> .
that ' s how i started in canton , ohio .
this is <person> . nothing can happen here .
that could be a fluke , right ?
or not .
-tossing more bantamweights out windows ?
the mutt jumped .
they obviously wanted it to be known that they offed <person> . some kind of statement .
<person> put <person> ' s head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago . and threatened him several times since . president <person> and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat .
that whirring ?
the gentle and soothing lullaby of a piece of machinery so perfect --
it ' s not a hundred miles . it ' s a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain : pure desert , mountains , a river . if the map is even real .
it ' s real . i ' m telling you , it ' s real .
yes , you did . now that is the question ! that is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . you tell me fisher . what have we done ?
i don ' t know ! i just want to get married .
it doesn ' t matter . i love him .
he doesn ' t deserve it .
the connective tissues between the hoof and the coffin bone are compromised and the coffin bone rotates toward the sole of the hoof . if he keeps walking , it ' ll puncture through . he ' s in a lot of pain .
and if he rests ?
g for `giancana . ' i owe him favors for the rest of my life .
we ' re out at the place in palm springs . you should come out for the weekend .
like ?
<person> had turned her out . using her the way the romans used to use their daughters when they did business : some pussy to sweeten the pot . <person> was she got picked up in this trick sweep few weeks back .
well --
maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss , and were really mean to you , and told you what a terrible thing it was . maybe it ' d be better if you told me how i ' m endangering my immortal soul , and if i don ' t quit i ' m going to burn in hell . <person> ' t you ever think that ?
. yes ? ? ?
before we go any further here , mr . <person> , from lloyds of london , i just want to get two things straight .
we offer him rewards .
what if that doesn ' t work ?
yes , two , followers of the chosen one , discovered by this loyal soldier .
just doing my duty .
what do you mean ?
<person> ' . forget it . <continued_utterance> you had a vision . you had yourself a vision . a man waits a long time for a vision . <person> go his whole lifetime and never get one . and along comes some instant indian with a mastercard and brand-new shoes , has himself a vision .
yes she did .
but i can see from your walk that you didn ' t sleep with her . <continued_utterance> let me see if i can guess . you haven ' t slept with her because . it ' s more fun when you can draw it out . <person> just isn ' t as good if the woman hasn ' t told all her friends she ' d never sleep with you .
how mysterious . a handsome young man with ' important business ' in the still of night . does it involve a young lady ?
no .
<person> . five years from now .
i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i ' m about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss <person> conroy of xenia , ohio .
she ' s beautiful , you know ?
thank-you . her name is <person> .
<person> ? for what ?
being born .
tilley . <continued_utterance> found this on your desk while i was going over some papers .
from the irs . i never even remember seeing it . i must have left it with my other bills . i wonder what it is ?
no ! he just needs par to tie ! tell him to lay up ! he listens to you !
go for it , <person> ! knock it on !
they love being beaten up by a woman i ' ve been looking for you all night -- why ' d they lock you up ?
i don ' t know . taking pictures . the usual . <person> got me released .
very well . i ' ll explain to <person> and <person> that you didn ' t care to come to the show tonight .
i ' ll have you court-martialed !
they - they don ' t know me . you do . they won ' t take me unless you go . <person> at me .
tough break .
i ' ve never seen him like this , <person> . he ' s got this delusion about <person> being the cause of all his problems and i don ' t know what to do .
he ' s under a lot of stress , <person> . his book , his interview which frankly didn ' t go so well , his birthday . that ' s a lot to bite off all at once . i ' ll give him a sedative and he ' ll be fine .
the baby ' s cold . take her .
you remind me of your father , sor- sha .
<person> ?
new hampshire .
<person> .
that ' s a reasonable question for a reporter to ask , isn ' t it ? ! i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this is the way it ' s going to be . i ' ll make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there . i ' m gon na show up to work at rockefeller center every morning and they ' re gon na hand me the news with my coffee and toast . i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this war down here belongs to you guys , okay ? i ' m on tomorrow ' s plane .
yeah !
it ' s the generator i think ! no power .
yes .
. sworn before god you would tell the truth ?
<person> . i ' ll call you back . in an hour . <person> ' t tell <person> .
i know . call me back . <person> , i love you , okay ?
she great or what ?
why are you doing all this ? to impress me ?
you ' ve misunderstood .
i see guys like you all the time in my work . you find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story , utterly convincing . and somewhere in there , you slip it in . ' i just need your credit card number ' , ' i just need a small down payment . ' <continued_utterance> did you know that this morning was the first morning i can remember , that i didn ' t open my eyes and feel that sadness . do you know what i ' m talking about ? that little bit of sadness ? i thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me . for why i survived that train . for why my life feels so out of balance . but i guess that ' s what you were counting on . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to leave now . <person> luck with your sale .
what did we find on the american ?
he ' s a tourist . member of the teacher ' s union . pays his taxes .
he finished it winter break . <continued_utterance> so . is he any good ?
no . not yet he isn ' t .
thanks .
they ' ll take you for a cat scan tomorrow if you ' re feeling dizzy at all .
a nod to the gods ?
to the gods , yes . that he is fallible . as the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth -- it ' s alive , this swing , a living sculpture -- and down through contact , always down , into terra firma , striking the ball crisply -- with character -- a tuning fork goes off in your heart , your balls -- such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot -- and then the follow through to finish , always on line -- the reverse ' c ' of the golden bear , the steelworker ' s power and brawn of <person> ' s arnold palmer , the da vinci of hogan , the unfinished symphony of roy mcavoy .
what ?
what happened with that guy at the cafe ?
why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world . you chose protection ?
are you for real ?
i ' m not going , with them .
<person> , like it or not , they ' re your parents .
we ' ve lost the signal .
<person> of a bitch ! where ?
no . much to the consternation of my fanatical parents i have converted to atheism . fortunately my brother , <person> , paved the way for such transgressions .
<person> is an atheist too ?
he ' s an enemy soldier .
i ' m not going to let you kill him .
she ' s in there right now saying the same thing about you .
i breached protocol . i broke contact with the s . a . c . i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device .
oh , <person> . call the police .
no .
so what ? who cares about <person> ?
well , if you don ' t like <person> , i can tell you right now you ain ' t gon na like this girl .
why ?
because he ' s an inconsiderate asshole .
there ' s enough business for us all .
i mean , we ' re fine .
dislocated collar bone . if any more tendons snap . it won ' t just be two weeks out of action .
i need you to pass me fit now , <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s just a scratch .
tell <person> to get the fuck off !
<person> , he just ate . <person> just stares at his friend . sully nineteen months i been sober .
if you have any questions , call dr . <person> .
have a great vacation !
we ' ll tell him the computer ' s worked out the operational details so we don ' t really need him . we ' re just doing him a favor .
and if that doesn ' t work ?
that ' s not true , honey --
it is true ! he doesn ' t know anything about me . he still thinks i ' m like ten years old or something . as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything ' s fine . but it ' s not fine . nothing ' s fine .
i have no more questions at this time . <continued_utterance> oh , one last thing . <person> ' t true that your father was a sea captain ?
yes .
- i told you ! he was there ! -
- but as i ' ve explained to <person> , without proof , there ' s just no story . <person> ' t you agree mr . <person> ?
because you ' re a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
and what does that make you ?
where ?
from here on , i go it alone .
<person> . you know what we have to do ?
no . i can give her an abortion . <person> rid of the bastard child , make them conceive one in wedlock . and then we are right as rain .
yeah .
i . i don ' t know what to say . i --
i know how you feel -- i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours . you know it ' s against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state .
that must make it tough .
appreciate the advice . i think we learned our lesson .
you city folk , ain ' t ya ? up from charleston roughing it , seeing how the `` other '' half lives ?
it ' s nothing .
it doesn ' t look like nothing .
the man ' s an ambulance chaser .
. tell me about this case .
enough ? never .
hey , is that `` old dog tray '' ?
<person> has some deep pockets . that ' s all i ' m saying .
i know how deep her pockets are , <person> . i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan . guess who ' s on the board of directors at the bank ? <continued_utterance> can ' t you take that stupid thing off ?
i hope you will take care of your mother better than that when i ' m gone . <continued_utterance> <person> , is that my shirt that you ' re wearing ?
yes .
this is a very different proposition .
we pay for that kind of information . <continued_utterance> is that what you ' re talking about , <person> ?
your language ? ha ! <person> girl , you ' re speaking ours .
heimdall ! open the bifrost ! <continued_utterance> he would open it if he could . i fear the worst .
<person> ' <person> , i am in your debt . what can i do to repay the courage you ' ve shown me ? anything , <person> ' <person> . whatever your heart desires .
<person> , his heart has only one desire . to become a musketeer .
it was doom who killed <person> , you know ?
why didn ' t you tell me ?
that ' s all i need . <continued_utterance> i appreciate it .
let me know when you ' re coming down .
your boy sought this out .
you ' re right . these are the actions of a boy . treat them as such . you and i can stop this before there ' s further bloodshed .
' turkey shoot ' is just a figure of speech .
there ' s no real turkey ?
i wonder if <person> could ever write a poem ? both of them drift off . donna do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster ?
faster and faster . for a long time you wouldn ' t feel anything . then you would burst into fire . forever .
are you solid with that ?
no . i think it ' s fucked .
. if i had your looks , better .
. takes years of genetics , pal , and a yale education . and the right tailor .
<person> ? what can i say about <person> ? he ' s a sales rep for a computer company .
would you say he was boring , then ?
<person> , are we cross ?
skinny lunger , your guns don ' t impress me . <person> ' t for those guns you ' d be nothin ' .
really ?
sure . my mom and lance are going to a movie and i ' m planning on stealing <person> ' s trailer and torching it in a parking lot , so you ' ll have the whole house to yourself .
i sure would .
<person> ?
<person> , but she wants to see her .
all right , i ' ll go explain the situation .
what did you ask me ?
what ?
he ' s up at the <person> out .
will he be back soon ?
why ? you ask me , <person> had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he ' s gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you ' re describing .
the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man ' s surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him . it ' s just a reminder of what should have been his . <continued_utterance> your old man graduates from <person> , you ' re not supposed to wind up there . <person> of <person> maybe , but not in the lousy guidance office . now . <person> number two . i ' ve run a financial on <person> . <person> was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like <person> .
i just thought you seemed cool . i don ' t have a line or a `game ' or whatever the hell it ' s called . so when i saw a chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours , i took it .
but how did you know where i lived ?
how ?
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we ' ve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .
come on , <person> .
by far the worst .
<person> . <person> chatter from a source you can ' t identify - who insists on talking only to <number> . nothing but loose talk and innuendo .

hell no !
you look like <person> taking a shit .
he ' s still got that mgm-face .
space for what ? to o . d . like that other kid ? i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents . because it isn ' t . <person> ?
we don ' t want to push her away . these are growing experiences .
<person> was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists . the guys processing this p <number> p into speed .
so one of them got to him .
well it feels like it . i ' m leaving her another message .

<person> , they ' re young . they ' re probably newlyweds .
i ' d like to tell you . but i can ' t .
' important business . ' <continued_utterance> i understand . men make bold plans in secret . and women wait . to mourn , or to celebrate the outcome . i know from experience , it ' s a lonely vigil .
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff . three categories : you like me , you hate me , you want something from me . definitely third category .

that ' ll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i ' ll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?

where were you going ?
<person> , is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first ?
i ' m afraid not , mr . president . the sub has positioned itself between the pierce and the soviet ships . admiral anderson insists it ' s too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters . the pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub .

<person> , since you weren ' t able to be on time for this hearing , i ' m going to ask you to step outside so that we can get <person> ' s version of the facts . so that she won ' t have to be paid the same disrespect .
perhaps in appreciation for our country ' s pursuit of peace , you might offer us some , token of gratitude .

that goddamn fool .
what do we do with him ?
you hate women .
<person> .
you have something to do with this ?
well . i thought of calling your photographs `` pictures from a lost war '' . i ' m great at captions -- the new york editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell <person> was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance , got you a cover , me a feature , and packaged a class struggle in two words . <person> , eh ?
good good . how you doin ' ?
ok . you know me , <person> . <continued_utterance> i was getting really worried about you .
just sitting here , it feels completely unreal . i ' m sure you knew that would happen .

i don ' t believe this . after the hartford fire and the hagenback- wallace wreck , that ' s the most famous circus disaster of all time .
i remember it like yesterday . <person> - cause i don ' t remember yesterday .

your cellular secretary , friend across all the digital wireless spread spectrum . so , francisco , what do you do ? you a pi ? private security ?
<person> .
i figure we could scrape together eight thousand .
oh . god , every time you and <person> --
<person> .

that won ' t be possible .
i ' m sorry i haven ' t always treated <person> the way -- i should have . she deserves better . <continued_utterance> i care for her .
from the moment i first saw you i knew i was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks , and when you started talking i was smitten and i ' m smitten more every day i think about you -- and the fact that you know i ' m full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually i can bullshit people but i can ' t bullshit you and in addition , most women i ' m thinking about how to get into their pants from day one but with you i ' m just thinking about how to get into your heart -- molly was clue-less . she just stares .
my god .
what is this newfound love for the frost giants ? you , who would have killed them all with your bare hands .
i ' ve changed .
you can call me <person> . you ' re very brave to do this . you opened it .
i just glances inside .

they said i ' d never see fbi again , and i ' m livin ' with you fuckers . i don ' t feed ya information on the warriors , it ' s back to the pen . i don ' t do this , back to the pen . your word against my word . against a con indian ' s word . i really got a chance , man , right ?
they sent me here , <person> because they said you didn ' t hold up your end of the arrangement , and i have to transport you back to leavenworth .
you told me .
they ' re so friendly . <person> ' t you think they are the friendliest flower ?
<person> away ?
he left his passport in curacao .
what do you mean i can ' t see him ?
the d . a . came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . <person> ' s lawyer comes in and five minutes later , the d . a . comes out looking like he ' d been bitch-slapped by the boogey man . they took his statement and cut him a deal .
but <person> . i mean . . how long ?
a couple weeks . that ' s why . that ' s why i had the gun . for protection .
tell me .
well , first you pick your place , see , then i ' d just sit back and watch it for awhile . <person> got ta wait for just the right moment , which is something you know instinctively , that can ' t be taught . then i ' d waltz on in . <continued_utterance> and i ' d say , `` alright , ladies and gentlemen , let ' s see who ' ll win the prize for keepin ' their cool . <person> says everybody lie down on the floor . if nobody loses their head , then nobody loses their head . you sir . you do the honors . just empty that cash into this bag and you ' ll have an amazing story to tell all your friends . if not , you ' ll have a tag on your toe . you decide . `` then i ' d split . <person> .
<person> , all you want to do is come over here and get drunk .
who ? me ?
i didn ' t want to bring up memories . i didn ' t want to do anything that might make you regret your choices . <continued_utterance> besides , dad would have freaked .
no , he wouldn ' t .
i never said that i wanted the child to be awakened , sir . i only asked to see her . if i ' m going to be taking care of the child on a round-the-clock basis , then .
' round-the-clock ' ? whaddya mean ' round the clock ' ? are you intending to sleep here ?
really , <person> , they must have taught you something at school ! bridewell suppose you explain it , <person> . <continued_utterance> certainly ! when i move in a straight line , forward or backward , that ' s one dimension . - when i move to the left or right , two dimensions . - when i move up and down , three dimensions . for instance , this box has three dimensions : length , breadth , and height . bridewell well , then , what ' s the fourth dimension ? <continued_utterance> well , that ' s . that ' s mere theory ! no one can really say what the fourth dimension is or even that it exists .
on the contrary , <person> ! the fourth dimension is as true and as real a dimension as any of the other three . in fact , they couldn ' t exist without it . dr . hillyer how do you mean ? <continued_utterance> well , take that box . it has the first three dimensions , as you said . but what if it didn ' t exist in time ?
<person> at that . busted . <person> new <person> , too . <number> years old and i don ' t even have a decent <person> . ' bout time i started <person>in ' out for myself .
well here we are a family again . <person> so long plain forgot how good it feels . want to thank you for that , <person> . all your doin ' .
<person> anything from <person> ' s file ?

you won ' t say anything to my parents ?
i don ' t give a fuck about your parents --
<person> ' t you afraid ?
a long time ago i learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head . maybe that ' s my problem . if you don ' t feel fear you can do some amazing things , but you can also screw your life up in ways you can ' t imagine .
i don ' t care where you get your dick wet <person> . i care that you ' re covering . twenty years dirty with this fucked-up family . your secrets must stink like rot .
you ' re worried about every wrong thing <person> . <person> ' s tee ' ing you up to take a big fat fall-

the universe is a living creature , like you and me , madmartigan .
<person> . it sure is .
i always wanted to travel . i just never got the opportunity .
of course , of course . only i have heard that comandante <person> has recently had his unit in the area .

i ' m not talking about the crater .
yeah .
well . i ' m not sure -- what do you mean ? it ' s important to me . i guess . and like , to my , you know , the people who care about me .

you know , you should swab that with alcohol . i might get an infection .
i ' ll return when this has taken effect . then we ' ll talk .
we ' ve become increasingly frustrated watching actors give us phony emotions , bored with pyrotechnics and special effects . while the world he inhabits is counterfeit , there ' s nothing fake about <person> himself . no scripts . no cue cards . it ' s not always shakespeare but it ' s genuine . that ' s how he can support an entire channel .
a window onto the human condition ?
i don ' t want to be just your friend --
you don ' t know what you want --
fifty-seven , fifty-eight --
just listen to what <person> did to <person> ! she --
it is a gift from the queen of america .

no .
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it wouldn ' t really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door . what are you selling ?
bad news .
you don ' t believe me ?
no .
yes , sir .
you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose .
maybe we ' re not supposed to understand , but we ' re supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture .
you have to believe to have faith .
they are better off disbanded .
your eminence , i ' ve been hearing some very troubling rumors about you .
the answer ' s yes . i think . yes . i don ' t know . where are they exactly ?
here we are ! <continued_utterance> <person> , hello there .
you heard ? how ?
a twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning .
what have we have ? a red , no , crimson rose , tucked into the pages . something you read about in a book , no doubt . one of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff . she holds her hand out for it . kathleen give it to me . <continued_utterance> it ' s a joke to you , isn ' t it ? everything ' s a joke to you . <continued_utterance> you know what the handkerchief reminds me of ? the first day i met you --
the first day you lied to me --
it was a bad dream .
it was so real .
oh , <person> ! what are we going to do ?
i don ' t know . <person> ' t let on we know he ' s written . he ' ll start in i ' m only his housekeeper and that i found out through some chicanery or something .
mr . <person> , i ' m there for you <number> % .
you don ' t understand . i want to be surprised . astonish me , sport , new info , don ' t care where or how you get it , just get it . my wife tells me you put a move on <person> . here ' s some inside info for you . that <person> guy she ' s going with ' s got big bucks but he ' s putting her feet to sleep . <person> visas are imminent . so don ' t lose your place in line . oh , jeez , i wish you could see this . the lights coming up over the water . i ' ve never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment . . an old russian proverb - `` a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar . `` i like you sport , i ever tell you that .
<person> ! you saved her life !
i did ? <continued_utterance> i mean , of course i saved her life . she ' s almost my daughter , isn ' t she ?
not when you ' re up here with the gold , i guess not . throwing <person> ' own words back at him:
not losing trust , are you ?
you know what i ' m doing with my part of the gold ?
if there ' s gold . if !
is that so ? well , we ' ll see who ' s the goofy one .
you ?
they ' ve been taken care of .
what do you mean ? <continued_utterance> what are you going to do with me ?
<person> . <person> .
and if no one comes to get them by night-time , then they belong to me .
position ?
two-two , zed-three , one-five north ; a hundred fourteen degrees , five minutes , ten seconds east .
the deer went in the other direction .
maybe it ' s someone , or something , stalking us .
yeah . that ' s what i ' m telling you . see you , <person> .
huh . ?
what happened ? somebody turn me around . <person> some of that jug !
shut-up camel .
look , i know you ' re upset . i ' m really sorry , honey . i raced home as quick --
it ' s okay , don ' t bother , <person> .
er . i don ' t know . it ' s all owned by you , that ' s obvious . humm . everything ' s from a garage sale !
vacation , <person> . everything you see is part of a vacation . every year , for one month , i bring my family to this house on vacation . nice , isn ' t it ?
mexico is a large country . where in mexico would you like --
i don ' t care , just get me there .
oh my god . oh my god .
you see it ?
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
<person> ' t worry , <person> , no one knows i ' m here .
you know who ?
maybe .
you know what they say , the only way to change the system is from the inside .
oh yeah ? why don ' t we start by taking this thing off my ankle ? the poison needles ?
but you ' re not dismissing me .
just on paper . <continued_utterance> <person> is to be removed from the city council race . the means and methods implemented to that end i will entrust to you .
<person> , let him go !
i was playing a trick . i-i-i had a baseball .
hello sweetheart , this is your mother . i ' m in leon and i miss you . <person> ' t worry about me -- it ' s not dangerous at all . i guess you can ' t believe what you hear on the news . i ' ll put this this tape in the mail when i get back to managua , but knowing what the mail service is like , i may be home before it arrives . i think about you all the time and hope i can make it back before you graduate from jr . high . <continued_utterance> i love you and i ' ll finish this letter when i get back to the hotel .
i know who shot <person> . i knew somebody was in the tower .
happily , it all worked out . this time . <person> , take <person> below and help him find a bunk .
i ' ll be frank with you . this was his mother ' s idea . a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me .
she ' ll figure it out by herself .
<person> , she ' ll manage .
i insist . you ' re doing me a favor . take it or i ' ll toss it in the ocean .
i ' ll wear it until you regain your senses . <continued_utterance> what ?
that country shit all sounds the same to me .
how about i pick one out for you ? <continued_utterance> you like <person> ? i just love her . how come , i wonder , she don ' t put out no more new records .
we have time .
goddamn it , it ' s obvious . it ' s the only option . that asshole , <person> . we can ' t let this drag out or we lose our shot .
do it .
<person> , second and third-degree .
well . whatever you ' d like .
thank you , no .
yes . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite prepared to tell you everything , though there isn ' t much you haven ' t guessed .
about the conspiracy ?
wait a minute . that reminds me . what precisely is the goal of the game we ' re playing now ? i mean , the rules , the objective . <person> ' s ever really said anything about what you have to do in existenz .
the beauty of existenz is that it changes every time you play it . it adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it . the result is that you have to play the game to find out why you ' re playing the game .
no . stop ! i can ' t !
what ' s the matter ? . <person> ?
he ' s very bold . do you really think my hair is beautiful ?
uh , yes . it ' s very nice hair . <continued_utterance> she ' s hungry .

. maybe . maybe we can fight our way out .
with what ? against how many ?
maybe . i don ' t know . i just know that when all this was happening , i felt , some part of me felt . alive . <person> somebody needed me . and the more i reached out to , it , the fuller it became .
you ' re saying you willed these events to happen ?
i ' m sorry he got those birds .
you know the man next door is near death . <continued_utterance> he must have gotten rid of those chickens . you don ' t hear them crowing anymore . i kind of miss it now .
what ' s the best way to qualify a mark ?
what ?
i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that ' s where the light comes from . <person> ' t see it with the lanternon .
the white dot ; light in the dark . <continued_utterance> maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
yeah .
hey , bacon boy , it ' s <person> .
any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .
. and everyone lived happily ever after .
<person> ' t i deposit it in the business account ?
no . it ' s not a legal fee . it ' s a personal fee .
oh , shit !
that ' s right , <person> . you better be afraid . i told you it wasn ' t over , but you didn ' t listen . now i find you sneakin ' around with my girl behind my back .
i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t . v .

what is your wife ' s picture doing by the side of your .

i was hoping that was just one crazy guy .

<person> , i ' m not as dumb as my hair makes me look .
but only you will know he ' s not human .
ms . <person> , you wanted to see me ?

you know we got ta dumbwaiter for that . <continued_utterance> not that one . <person>-o here .
i ' m kidding . <person> ?
oh . right . ha . <person> , about last night . there is something i need to tell .
we also have a few rental items .
there ' s a penalty for any material returned to the trans-border library with sticky pages . <continued_utterance> hey , you can ' t do that ! ! he can ' t do that ! !
that ' s not funny !
<person> , i couldn ' t resist . but you know . i do feel the urge to kill someone here .
i ' ll take it .
i give you the body of <person> , head of lapd ' s <person> . proof of a <number> -year criminal collusion between his department and <person> and my testimony to link the dots . then i leave la for good .
<person> . i ' m in love with her . <person> . then walter ' s voice returns : even , administrative .
are you drinking . professor tripp ? right now .
you ' re kidding ?
take a look at this , <person> .
god damn , you people are confusing .
what was here , mr . <person> ?
oh ! oh ! <continued_utterance> oh --
oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee !
do you want your coat ? it ' s cold out here .

you ' re pretty full of yourself , aren ' t you ?
hey , <person> -- what ' s on a tree ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! way to go , <person> -- pretty smart . oh , i was wondering , <person> -- i wanted to ask you something : how ' s the world treating you ? <continued_utterance> rough ! yeah , i know what you mean .
that ' s dumb . a little funny , though . how come your dad never comes to meetings with you ?
they don ' t particularly . that was my idea . this assignment was boring me to death . the personality they gave you wasn ' t too thrilling .
well , what did i do on <person> that they have to keep me from telling ?
cut it out , <person> . <person> foot .
this is no fun .
what ? what ' s wrong ?
<person> , utah . <person> effective immediately . <continued_utterance> i already gave <person> my letter of resignation .
why no ?
i don ' t trust the driver !
feeling better ?
that was about as grim as it gets .
i ' m not looking to just survive . <continued_utterance> that if you make an enemy of <person> <person> , i won ' t be there to stand by you .
you really mean that ? what ' d he promise you ? to take you public ? i guess without <person> ' s money and seal of approval , i ' m not such a hot investment anymore . you ' re just the best money can buy , <person> .
<number> oakridge drive .
oh , yeah , i know where that is . all right . if the guy calls again , try to keep him on the line for at least a minute so we can trace the call .
no .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! <person> away !
yeah . i hate that too .
the worst , the worst -- i could never , under any circumstances , love anybody who had a sailboat .
very well , thank you .
oh , i ' m not feeling at all well . you see , it ' s very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back . mcu -- <person> --
<person> or <person> ?
neither .
hey , what are you doing in here ?
the officers told me to wait here . i ' ve been sitting here for over two hours .
what --
what happened to your face ?
yeah ?
come sit by me . <continued_utterance> i dont know that this is the right place for us .
her doctors killed her .
i ' m sorry . ?
everythins relative . wheres that <person> ? you two didn't split up , i hope .
no . shes fine . back home .
well , <person> did call me into his office today . and he did tell me i didn ' t have my old job anymore .
<person> , what did you get ?
what do you expect me to do , thank him ?
this . isn ' t . . possible !
so i see celery , i see the lettuce , tomatoes , cauliflower . and i think , all these things come out of the ground . they just grow out of the ground . they had corn -- out of the ground . radish -- out of the ground . you say to yourself , how can all these things come out of the ground ? you know what i ' m talking about ? all these things are out of the ground .
<person> .
i ' ve been looking all over for you . you still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ?
yeah .
hell yes , all hundred and seventeen of ' em !
no , leave one . somebody ' s grandmother might want one .
it hasn ' t changed . it ' s died .
so then there ' s more talk about the wind . while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous . and when you finally get back , you have to clean up the boat .
because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
this isn ' t about you , <person> . they ' re doing this to me .
shit , what difference does it make .
<person> ! did this man rape you ?
like what ? the moons of <person> ?
can ' t you have a normal conversation ?
this is <person> . he ' s a feeder fish , and he ' s about to get dropped into a shark tank .
c ' mon , give the guy a break . at least we ' ve seen him fight before .
<person> , all you want to do is steal jack ' s girl friends . you don ' t give a shit about the women themselves .
that ' s not true . it ' s just that <person> drives me crazy . she knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad .
three and a half .
<person> , <person> . <person> doin ' ?
who was that ?
sylvia -- she wanted to know how <person> was doing .
<person> ! but i know a lot of women who do . why , if i had somebody in my life -- a little daughter for instance -- i ' d have a reason to live . <continued_utterance> <person> . you can ' t let me die here . not when i wan na help you .
you got ta promise to feed her .
no ! get me out !
this is too big for even you . where is it ?
what ' s gotten into you ? <continued_utterance> oh , still sore about this .
something your father would ' ve come up with .
hey .
hey . nice tie .
yes .
tell me .
you want to take a look at my car ? i think the radiator hose is --
damn . <person> na be another hot one today . sometimes i don ' t even want to get out of bed . course don ' t want to get out for the cold one ' s neither . then of course the clouds come in .
this is a complicated case , your honor .
i ' m sure it is , <person> : and let me tell you something . if we find it so complex , how in the hell you think you ' re going to make a jury understand it ? see my point ? let ' s talk a minute . <person> : what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop ?
yeah . are you <person> ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s your cash .
for a guy about to try his first <person> , you are extremely uptight .
we can ' t afford that !
well -- brian ? i understand what you ' re saying , and i think it ' s great . i do . because there ' s a lot of things around here that could use some attention . believe me . but i ' ve honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes , and if i take the time out of my lunch hour .
i ' d really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement . ok ?
<person> , what are you doing here ?
you can call me <person> again . <person> said <person> sounds too pretentious .
well , this is where i leave you .
<person> . i ' ll walk you to your door .
all i told them was the truth .
they ' re trying to divide us on this , <person> . we can ' t let them .
that his . betrayal was far greater than her own . soon after he foreswore the society that shaped him . <person> up his title . and was never seen again .
he loved her .
how ' d you find me ?
heard you come here now and again . figured you ' d be needing a little drinky tonight .
can we leave this up ' til we move ?
well , sure , we can leave it up .
just for the operation in paris . i need to be married . they ' ll be looking for a man traveling alone .
we ' re going to paris ?
oh , but we must !
orders are - not nobody ! not nohow ! <continued_utterance> he ' s in conference with himself on account of this . <continued_utterance> . trouble with the witch . and even if he wasn ' t you wouldn ' t have been able to see him anyway on account of nobody has - not even us in the palace !
i ' m sorry . professor tripp . maybe it ' s seeing that jacket that belonged to her . it just looks . really lonely . hanging there . in a closet . maybe i ' m just a little sad .
maybe . i ' m feeling a little sad myself tonight .
i ' m looking forward to it . <continued_utterance> why are you helping these raving psychotics .
because they ' re very well-funded raving psychotics , and i ' m getting a lot of money . <continued_utterance> you think i care about their cause ? or yours ? not at all . <person> , america is on top now . . . but so was rome , once . all civilizations crumble . one nation succeeding over another . what does it mean in the long run ? the only important thing is to live well . and . living well takes money .
we don ' t think so . i mean , we just want the singing when i come out .
<person> great . what will that be ?
it feels like a storm has passed . <person> read some of <person> ' s letters to a woman he had a child by . the child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort . <person> didn ' t know that deep down at the bottom of <person> ' s hate , there was some love .
did i ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell ? he didn ' t want nobody ' s opinion but his own . <continued_utterance> he ' s going to check out heaven first . he gets a round trip ticket to heaven . he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home . people dripping with sweat , working in the fields , hardly surviving . he asked a man who was getting a drink of water , `` i thought the streets were paved with gold . `` `` they are but you won ' t see them , '' he said . `` boy , you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness . `` so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell . he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back , picking their teeth . `` man , this is a dream . `` he asked , `` what ' s you ' ll doing ? '' they all hollered back , `` sinning . `` the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said , `` please to meet you . `` he asked , `` i thought you ' ll was supposed to be burning in fire . `` <person> said , `` man , ain ' t no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins . `` the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth .
god .
you know this is adultery . you burn in hell for that .
thats just another part of the price to pay .
<person> . you kill that <person> , otherwise hes gon na turn my baby against me .
who ' s car is that ?
long story .
<person>bye . <continued_utterance> what the hell you doing ? !
his mother needs a piece of his hair . it ' s for the keeping of the souls ceremony . has to be kept for four days .
thank you . i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> we don ' t have anything from the nurse association ?
the broad has disappeared .
<person> , <person> threw my baseball down the street ; and i can ' t find it !
well , we ' ll look for it real hard later . let me talk to mommy .
that ' s right ! <continued_utterance> i think she ' s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
<person> --
no one ' s discussing it . i ' m just gon na run <person> home . i ' ll be right back .
i need you to pick up the cake tomorrow .
this man ' s family will want to see the body laid to rest .
tell them he was trying to save the young boy ' s life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .
if i ' m right , their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night ' s event .
meaning ?
seems to like some of the same places you do . funny you never met .
<person> , real funny . you ' re wrong about this , i could get busted on the spot .
the watch .
i don ' t know . you ' re about his size . that ' s all .
why ? why not ? where are you goin ' ?
<person> , i ' m goin ' home . to bed . my nice warm bed .
yes , but it was your idea .
that ' s true . <person> , maybe i am gay .
where ' d you go to school ?
um . <person> .
<person> , i was just about to give up on you .
well -- maybe it would ' ve been better if you had . <continued_utterance> i mean -- look , i don ' t mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation , whatever it is , but i ' m just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions , they might end up having a lot less trouble generally . that ' s all .
yeah , i heard a key slapping against my ass .
there ' s someone in the house . grace <continued_utterance> relax baby . <person> here .
<person> . <person> , listen .
it ' s all right . it ' s all right . we ' re <person> boys , yeah ?

two days .
<person> , thank you . thanks for everything . but i ' ve got to go .
you want to climb a telephone pole ?
of course i don ' t want to ! but it ' s got rungs . <person> ' t be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym . big fat repair guys do it all the time , right ? right ?
. and so , it ' s somewhat fitting that we are here today . to christen this environmental research boat in venice - - ' <person> ' - the port where <person> sailed forth to explore the world ' s great uncharted oceans . that <number> / <number> of the earth ' s surface where the sharks are not working members of the press . <continued_utterance> with our six custom designed sea-bed coring drills , we will probe the long-term effects of pollution ; our sonars , radars , and research labs will study the wind , the water , and the sea life that so dearly feeds us . <continued_utterance> and so , in the spirit of international cooperation - thanking my good friend , <person> - the newly elected president of the ukraine for all his assistance - <continued_utterance> i give this boat to mankind - selflessly - in pure charity asking nothing for myself . but the cable tv rights . <continued_utterance> <person> ? if you ' ll do the honors - <continued_utterance> now i ' ll take some questions from the press - even the few of you who aren ' t on my payroll .
mr . <person> : why did you name this boat the sea dolphin ii ?
<person> , like <person> on tax day . get the keys ? darrell well , there ' s a $ <number> overnight storage charge we got to talk about . <continued_utterance> all i got ' s a hundred , <person> . you got change ?
no .

<person> . how long will it take ?
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gim me a break . you ' re not interested in my past , you ' re interested in my future as some kind of spy .

so you got my mom ' s money . <continued_utterance> how much ? <continued_utterance> how much ?
about six and a half million dollars .
all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . <person> ? you happy ? so now what ?
so now you ' ve got to talk him out of it . and then we ' ve got to figure out an acceptable political solution .
<person> , this is no time to panic .
this is the perfect time to panic ! i ' m lost , <person> is gone , they ' re going to move from their house in two days and it ' s all your fault ! !
you want to stay .

that is called a crab apple switch . it ' s for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i don ' t know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk ' s stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down <person> and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was <person> . my daddy taught both of us to play but <person> was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named <person> sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . <person> had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl ' s room and he wouldn ' t stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
uh oh .
what do you mean ?
that ' s ' cause he ' s dead .
oh , <person> .
we got carried away . we won ' t do it again .
i want you out by six thirty . understand . <person> comes at seven , i want you out by six thirty .
i was a little worried . i mean --

phone or mail , <person> . <person> negotiable .
<person> , have you ever seen my hands so steady ? have you ?
he tried to kill him twice before . that ' s a good place to start don ' t ya think ? <person> was on the other side , wasn ' t he ?
-- <person> was an apple , that ' s right . red on the outside , white on the inside . and <person> hated him . kicked his ass a coupla times . but he didn ' t kill him .
what you want ?

you ' re going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on `` oprah '' that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them .

can you fix it ?
hi , ted .
you look great .
split in half ! d ' <person> rides with me !
we ' ll see you in calais !
dunno , but when he ' d get drunk , he ' d trade <person> for blowjobs out back a ' the club .
where ' s this girl now ?
. <person> , so i ' m probably not gon na be able to stay more than a day or so .
oh . well . that ' s all right . !
<person> , see how easy that was . it ' s off-season , park ' s pretty quiet . even more than usual . you may run into a few locals , but --
people live up here ?
i don ' t know , and i wasn ' t about to mess with it .
should have blown already . <person> fuse , that ' s <person> stuff .
many times . you ' re brave to do it .
they just stole my entire life ' s work . i really don ' t have anything left to lose .
that bothers you ?
yeah , maybe , a little .
what happened overnight ?
he couldn ' t do it , even on the sofa .
what are you talking about ? bobby when i got back from the garage , and your jeep wasn ' t there , i thought you ' d gone and left me and taken the money . . cause i never had any luck with women , <person> . you don ' t know what i been through . the shit i ' ve taken . i thought you were like the rest of ' em . but when you came out of the house . well you ' re here <person> and we might be starting in the shit but we ' re starting where i never been -- together with
we ' re gon na pull this off , <person> .
russell prefers pictures to words .
you don ' t have to apologize . you ' re journalists .
what ' s the gimmick , <person> ? that ' s the part i don ' t get . you gon na hold the world hostage with your gas bombs ? i didn ' t think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche .
you think i ' m after money ? i told you , my friend . <person> . time for a change . <person> is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
that ' s over . way over .
i can ' t know things if you don ' t tell me .
yes , the ship is down there . but the gold is gone .
that ' s absurd ! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
she ' s been dead a year .
who ?
not yet .
have you asked her out ?
what ! ! ? we have to get him out of there .
<person> ' t matter ! he ' s already dead !
i defy your hamburger theory of life , and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents .
that ' s crazy talk .
all implanted .
our friends . my work .
well . look .
so it ' s the rockettes , so what ?
what ' s with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you ' re `` extreme '' ? i ' ve got some news for you , mr . x , you ' re a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x ' s on your head .
i ' ll take that under advisement . maybe i can be like you and lose a leg for the old stars and <person> . i bet the flag ' s a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs .
yes , there is . i ' d like to go up .
in this weather ?
<person> ' t make so much out of it . only reason i haven ' t figured a way to get all that money for myself is because i ' ve been too busy figuring ways to stay alive . believe me ; if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and <person> had . i ' m no better than anybody else . i ' ve just been busier .
<person> ?
hi , guys .
g ' damn , price , you tuna sucking piece of raw meat -- whatchyou goin ' to zambeze for ?
that ' s a big book you ' re writing .
i think it ' s sort of writing itself at this point .
it depends on if we really believe there ' s been a coup .
i agree . if there has been a coup , and there ' s a hard-line government in power now , then it doesn ' t matter what we say . the end of the day we ' ll either agree to their terms , they ' ll agree to ours , or we ' ll go to war . but what if there hasn ' t been a coup ? what if . what if what is happening is a series of accidents ?
wonderful ! why , if our scarecrow back in <person> could do that , the crows ' d be scared to pieces !
they would ?
i ain ' t got no eyes . you want to see ?
<person> no !
you ' re telling me , but only because you never let me in on any of it . you ' re not going to see <person> , are you ?
maybe .
nothing too bad . but i got ta tell you , i know things didn ' t work out too well this time .
well , <person> --
give it a rest . you were thinking the same thing , just didn ' t have the guts to take the heat .
we can horsetrade with <person> on ships . but it doesn ' t get us any closer to removing those missiles .
andlt ; andlt ; are you sure ? andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; <person> ' t be stupid . andgt ; andgt ;
nobody . i ' m a nobody who arrested you , but your wife is a murderer .
hey , you can ' t be in here .
a woman .
what color hair will she have ?
what is it you find incredible ?
well . where would you like me to start ? <person> is a long way from dallas , <person> . i can ' t very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you ' ve made here . bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism .
<person> , don ' t , <person> ! come on , <person> . never mind . he ' s drunk .
i want them spitting blood !
looks like a diner .
<person> , huh ? let me tell you what the problem is . i wake up drugged to find what ? you ' ve got a `` salesman '' over here reading a three week old newspaper . he ' s pulling a <number> with a `` trucker '' , who happens to be packing a cop issue handk <number> mm . i get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note . how ' s that for twisted logic ? how did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before i `` walked '' in ? and if that ' s true , why ' d they stop and wait until i woke up to gaffle the money ? then i notice how beefy they both are . <person> , even the waitress is cut . all three of them look like they went through the same training program . ergo they ain ' t strangers and this isn ' t what it seems . that ' s how i knew yo-yo wouldn ' t get a round off even if i gave him all day . why ? <continued_utterance> cuz there ' s nothing but blanks in these guns . and no offense , but their performances were terrible .
say what ? honestly , sugar , you can talk more shit sometimes ?
got you a pack of mores again , huh ?
then you are completely unnecessary .
i have the documents , the landing authorizations , the security passes .
so that ' s what we ' re doing .
no we ' re not . the bodies are all mixed up . we can ' t do this to them .
you ' re gettin ' in deeper every moment you ' re gone .
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident ?
deaf ears , mr . <person> . i answer to a higher power .
here ' s the deal , <person> . forget the `` rules and regulations '' malarkey and we ' ll give you seven minutes in heaven with the taylor triplets .
kettleman , <person> and mcgrath .
of course . mrs . <person> . and what were you going with the international terrorist , carlos the jackal ? taking dictation ?
<person> will ya .
d . k . -- didn ' t know -- who i was when the options he bought took a bath . he reneged on me .
that ' s right .
has he threatened you ?
just as long as there ' s no maximum .
<person> , i ' ll sign my check now .
i ' d doing this !
ok , son .
<person> . it ' s just , things are a bit hot for me right now . if i get a signal . i may have to leave suddenly .
i understand .
oh , you don ' t think we ' re going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees , do you ?
no , sir !
one last question .
<person> .
you didn ' t take any pictures when it was over .
i didn ' t ? i picked up a gun . <person> . is something happening to us ?
hey , <person> . <person> ' t believe your tank ' s dry up at the mill .
no . hell , no . <person> got in the truck , started drivin ' , looked down at the gauge and saw a big `` e '' starin ' at me .
of course .
all i have to do is take one small step at a time and i can do anything !
not in the strait . how ' s our position ?
according to the satellite , we ' re exactly on course .
but you do admit to touching her , to putting your arm around her . <person> ' t that against the rules ?
it is and i don ' t . <person> . but , i mean . there ' s this kid standing in front of you crying .
the later events have never been kept a secret .
where am i ? and how can i leave ?
you might try being saddled sometime -- the smell of leather , the sting of a whip .
i ' m just a humble golf pro .
just what the hell is wrong with you ?
what do you mean ?
<person> , i got a rule . i don ' t talk to lawmen . dog-catchers neither .
i ' m not a lawman , i ' m just a private citizen getting ' my property back
<person> ' am , please -- <continued_utterance> mrs . <person> . i ' m indian . <continued_utterance> i ' m <person> . <continued_utterance> yeah , right . <continued_utterance> shit . mrs . <person> ! it ' s okay !
<person> <number> , give me a <number> .
heads up , man . what ' s this thing on my back ?
a parachute . this does not argue well . then the red light switches to green .
you know , clean the pipes .
pipes ? what are you talking about ?
i could be wrong . what happened anyway ?
huh ? oh , someone pulled a bande on dr . <person> ' s closet . and the dog ' s missing .
in that case , we should go to the canyon trailer park .
<person> , <person> . <person> . <person> morning .
deserting what ? what the hell are we deserting ?
it ' s war . people get lost all the time in war , cut off --
i can feel your pain .
by the way - what is it that brings you to <person> , mister <person> ?
<person> and i share no blood links of any kind . <continued_utterance> sounds rather zealous .
yes , even though i am no longer a believer i always found the services wonderfully aerobic .
you mean all this time you ' ve never lived with a girl ?
what ? ! did we just meet ? how long we been partners ? no , i ' ve never lived with a girl !
for your information i was in line and i just stepped out to chew some food for an elderly lady .
<person> said he saw you in the garden with <person> .
<person> , i need for you to be practical and realistic .
<person> ? i am trapped inside a body that no longer moves of my own volition . i am trying to be practical . now either you ' re with me or against me . in or out !
no you ' re not .
i ' ll be a laughing stock !
nothing that we can do can make that woman well .
and no one will know the truth .
buy you a drink ?
<person> . i wasn ' t expecting you ' til tomorrow .
where would i start ?
why here ?
thanks . <continued_utterance> quite a shopping spree . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean .
hey , i ' ve got it , i may as well spend it , right ? i ' ve always wanted to live where i could dive for my dinner .
<person> is an atheist too ?
buddhist , i believe , though we have not seen him in some time . i myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage .
i know , mr . <person> . i know . i was on my way to you , it ' s just . what a day i ' ve had . i know i ' m coming up with a highly improbable story , and i know you ' re not going to believe this , but this . is . <continued_utterance> and that ' s not the half of it , mr .
`` <person> ''
somebody has to .
<person> , but why me ? what if the car doesn ' t stop ?
<person> , brother ?
have you ever known me to be nervous ?
she belongs to all of us . she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth .
what a relief . now i can go home .
by the way , did you call ted fein ?
why ? he ' s a salami with eyes .
of course . you must be so proud .
i am .
and i get a loaner if the car ' s got to stay ?
as we discussed , you get a car if the car has to be kept overnight .
<person> , boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man . a boy ' s whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed .
so far , i agree .
popularity has its price .
i have some excellent brandy here . would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the cardinal ?
my work keeps me young .
<person> part , getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities ?
<person> ' t matter . whatever he wanted he didn ' t get it . we ' ve got no need staying around here . it ' s light enough . <person> ' s pack up and head out .
what about him ? we . we have to do something . <continued_utterance> we can ' t just leave him . he ' ll run back to his outfit , report our position .
i don ' t want <person> for dinner , <person> .
<person> .
my god ! did you say i need a psychiatrist ?
i haven ' t seen you move that fast since i ' ve known you .
that is why i ' m king . <continued_utterance> i , too , grieve the loss of our son . but there are some things that even i can not undo .
you can bring him back .
no . oh , shit . i think i might ' ve left it in the parking lot .
what ? !
because this isn ' t a dry wash . <continued_utterance> it ' s the little walking river . <continued_utterance> and it was full of water when i drove by here three days ago . full . i mean . a river .
the little walking river . you ' re right . this is part of it . so whoever sunk this car didn ' t compensate for drought . <person> .
it better not be my aunt trudy . <continued_utterance> <person> to keep you waiting .
hi , <person> .
oh , yeah . go ahead . <continued_utterance> i ' m glad i didn ' t have to kill you . i ' m glad it didn ' t come to that .
yeah . well , me too .
and she was never found ?
nah . she was a live wire . had this old <person> . it ' s gone too . most of her friends think she ' s tooling around mexico somewhere . police downgraded her to a runaway .
<person> ? he looks like <person> .
he ' s not a racehorse , <person> , he ' s a jumper .
what happened to lance ?
lance is busy training to be a detective . he isn ' t around as much as he used to be . <continued_utterance> mr . <person> is very smart . ask him a question , <person> .
i think i might ' ve said i was in love with you . <person> ' s face remains . unchanged . grady he told you .
he told me .
you ain ' t that friendly a guy .
we ' re playing <person> where you once shot fifty-nine , where you can shoot sixty-five in your sleep ' cuz you know every bump on every fairway , every subtle break on every green --
can you tell me what their names were ?
<person> . <person> . <person> was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did . two <person>s .
could you stop , please . you ' re giving me a headache .
a headache ?
<person> , <person> . let your daddy and your uncle and leland talk . <person> . leland , we can play the french against the norwegians . what do the french love more than anything ?
boating ?
at ease ! how are you , captain .
i ' m fine , sir .
she seemed to take it pretty well .
<person> , well , actually . . . <person> looks over . grady <continued_utterance> don ' t be proud , <person> . we ' re in sewickley heights . we could find you a nice golf course to barf on .
how ' s this going to work ?
me and wes each going take an end of the rope , run our asses of , and yank you off the mine .
everyone has an idea about you and the english .
all of them charitable , i ' m sure .
<person> , it ' s <person> at base , come back .
go for , <person> . <continued_utterance> restrain him .
keep reading .
`` there is marked falling away of the muscle masses on either side of the spine in the lower lumbar region . his lower extremities present a most depressing picture . `` <continued_utterance> `` i feel after studying him that the psychological factor in his management is paramount . he has such courage and ambition . yet at the same time he is such an extraordinarily sensitive emotional mechanism .
well , if you ' re that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .
where is it ?
just stay down .
what are we going to do ? what the hell are we going to do ?
the driver , the number one wood --
it ' s metal .
to make you another proposition .
so you ' re the one who let us into <person> .
maybe it ' s someone , or something , stalking us .
quit it .
my name ' s <person> . and furthermore , you came back to see me tonight .
what if it wasn ' t you that i came back to see ?
i signed something .
was the man at the restaurant there ?
you okay ?
. i think so . you ?
<person> is not dead . i just saw him .
this is why <person> is so interested in cleaning up tijuana . <person> , who ' s supposed to be dead , owns him . and <person> is making a move on <person> .
everybody who have been associated with <person> end up with pennies over their eyes .
what must i do ?
put your shoulders back .
what ?
i don ' t even know if that ' s my kid !
they just showed up ! we never seen them before .
<person> , taggarty . <person> , everyone .
<person> , darling , this is <person> .
little over two hours .
maybe it ain ' t coming .
you weren ' t in school yesterday .
i went to the doctor with my father .
when this is over we should bury the hatchet . celebrate . a champagne dinner ?
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens .
how could you have done this ?
do you understand what he set in motion ? he ' s taken us to the brink of war !
<person> !
the little shit lied to me about that guy ! <person> picks up the startled dog and pets him .
oh , yeah ? well , if you hadn ' t shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
<person> ' t talk to me about importance . because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy . <continued_utterance> right now , poised at the edge of the galaxy , <person> has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet . i alone have information that reveals this weapon ' s only weakness . and you , my friend , are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with <person> .
<person> ?
no doubt . you ' ll probably be shot at in less than two chapters .
no . what do you want ?
i just wanted to say how sorry i was about the match and if i did anything to cause it then i will never forgive myself . i know how much wrestling means to you , baby .
there was a time when i thought you might have stayed .
there was .
what is your name , please ?
dr . <person> .
he -- <person> . <person> -- it ' s <person> .
something to do with <person> , is what i ' m getting .
and then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated --
who ' s intimidated ? i just told you i ' m gon na win the damn thing !
get in the car .
hi ! this is <person> . it must be fate that i found you so quickly ! <person> stops and stands , a little out of breath . <continued_utterance> is this a bad time ?
is he the one that killed <person> ?
no . but i ' m sure <person> ' s dead .
<person> , okay . take it easy . <person> ' t freak out on me .
do you have a mirror ? it ' s the best way to see if someone ' s breathing .
. going places , good junk bond department , you got the financing on that syndicam deal .
. <person> , and we ' re working on some other interesting stuff .
that ship was firing starshells . starshells . <person> , mr . secretary . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' ve got a job to do . you ' ve been camped out up there since monday night . you ' re exhausted and you ' re making mistakes . interfere with me , you will get some of killed . i will not allow that .
starshells .
trying to figure out what ' s wrong with my fricking back-up system .
just call your it guy ?
<person> ? for what ?
i don ' t know . he just fired me .
objection , we ' ve .
. to get her heartbeat back . ?
yes , that ' s what i want . thanks d .
<person> , l . i am your friend . always . but sometimes . lately . i feel that you don ' t like being around me because i am so uptight . no , i am uptight . i hate it . i don ' t want to be this way , but <person> i don ' t . i mean . i ' m your friend no matter what way you are .
<person> ! ! what are you doing ? i thought you were --
come on , sheriff . there ' s a kid over in that house who needs us .
how is it ?
excellent . couple of swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell .
no . <continued_utterance> this is <person> . who is this ? hi , <person> . we ' re stuck on the sixth floor . there are four of us --
-- and if you don ' t get your ass up here in two shakes and get us out -- he hangs up .
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .
what i was thinking was she ' d probably make a great children ' s book either .
why would you think that ?
<person> was taken to the tomsky institute for a few days for observation . he lost his medical license , of course . a doctor can ' t try to kill one of his patients and expect to get away with it .
well thank god for that . i mean . , you know . i mean . then what happened ?
some folks take that natural stuff too far .
<person> ' s wife kept her afterbirth ' in the refrigerator . that ' s why i do not eat over there now .
ma ' am , we have reason to believe you may have illegal drugs hidden beneath your clothing . i need to conduct a pat down search . <person> will witness the search .
you ' ve got to be kidding me . i ' m pregnant . what if i refuse ?
i knew it wasn ' t possible . what can i say ? sometimes a person just wants the impossible . could i ask you something ?
what ?
<person> . it ' s a good day to die .
<person> , let ' s get outta here,
i haven ' t needed it lately . <continued_utterance> you ' re in for a disappointment .
i know that .
are you <person> ' s mother ?
i am . i ' m helping him with the sale .
i ' m a teacher . high school math . and you ? what do you do ?
this is what i do , frank .
i ' ve heard they ' ve got snakes that ' ll outrun a horse through the grass . they got a snake that bites you . you got eleven seconds to live . no thank you . i don ' t want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy . i ' d like to go to a place where . hold it !
what ' s wrong ?
i ' d just like to get to the point , mr . <person> . <person> ' s not waste these people ' s time . answer the question , mr . witness . please . would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence ?
i . in that small context i would have . i would have to say ' no . '
now which way do we go ?
that way is a very nice way . cs -- <person> , his arm pointing to right --
that ' s right . they want something . dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you ' re the one to see .
so what did these . people . say about me exactly ?
<person> , you have the greatest taste in shoes i ' ve ever seen . <person> none . anywhere .
the old place sure looks more crowded with people in it .
you did say `` ahab '' ? you ' re sure about that ?
yeah , i sent you pictures . here ' s what i ' m thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it ' s swimming up the potomac .
howd she sound ? was she doin okay ?
could she be doin okay , <person> ? shes tryin to prove somethin to me , thats all . <person> aint doin no moren showin off , defyin me . <person> , <person> done somethin bad .
tick-fucking-tock . that ' s the fucking problem , <person> . i ' m thirty-four . i ' m older than <person> . <continued_utterance> where do the dreams go , <person> ?
you win .
thousand , huh ? that must be with a guarantee .
as is , where she is .
the name is <person> . <person> .
always nice to meet one of her majesty ' s fellow subjects . especially one with such distinguished friends .
let me handle this part . do you mind ? why did you go to <person> ' hideout ?
he wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .
since the beginning .
how . ?
my feet have never been on anything that wasn ' t directly attached to the ground .
stay until you feel better ? i would like to hear all the news .
that ' s coming right from the president , captain .
<person> . uh . . . sir ? you ' re going to have to sign for the aircraft .
soon as we ship it ' ll be `` forgetta '' .
<person> ' t mind him , <person> . you ' re talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline .
what makes you say that ?
because you ' re a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money .
what did it look like ? <continued_utterance> there were bees . and corn crops . <continued_utterance> what are they ?
what do you think ?
get him in .
come on in ! ! !
<person> .
but beef-witted is a little more than i can stand , not to mention unfair .
i ' m mad at you .
go have fun . not too much .
he didn ' t do anything . he just told me his theory . it ' s sad when patients get like that . they loose reality . david <person> what the hell are you doing ?
-<person> did you load that gun ? <person> nods , `` yes . `` crying harder now . jeremy -you won ' t get hurt . <continued_utterance> -<person> was wrong .
i think i ' m going to need your help .
<person> ?
what are you , sick ? . im with <person> .
no . i just wanted to kiss you good-bye . you know too much bout little <person> mom .
it ' s a little isolated , is all .
not that isolated .
i can ' t throw that far . you got to climb down here and get the keys . you can make it . it ' s the only way <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> ! . <person> , <person> ! you have to help me . <person> takes a look around .
<person> . i ' m coming . <person> down ! <continued_utterance> why ' s that ?
how do i wake up ?
the decision is yours .
to the city . i have to find maya .
the city ! he said <person> ' s going to smite them with holy fire !
look , <person> . when you get him home . make sure he ' s ail right . before you leave . <person> ?
i would if i knew where i was taking him .
<person> . <continued_utterance> loaded him into a car-
-are all the <person> vehicles accounted for ?
just be cool .
it ' s a mine , isn ' t it ?
my subscription lapsed three years ago .
that ' s why i ' m calling , <person> .
i don ' t get upset .
then can ' t we just talk ?
and i am --
we know who you are , <person> . why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world ?
time . bobby what time is it now ? <continued_utterance> twenty-after-ten .
<person> . twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already .
that ' s it ? nothing else about me ?
oh yes . <person> to you and <person> . who ' s <person> ?
why did you continue to see him ?
he needed my help .
if you ' re such a legendary striker of the golf ball as everyone says , then why are you , at your age , out here in the middle of nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment , ducking the i . r . s . , collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack -- when you ' re capable of so much more ?
perhaps i ' m chocked full of inner demons ?
the post-vegas man .
a mutant species .
eliminate the competition .
you got it . the rich got richer . while the saps like <person> went belly-up in the swamp .
<person> , are you my best friend ?
of course . <continued_utterance> what is it <person> ? what ' s wrong ?
why do you say that ?
we ' re supposed to write a story for english homework , but they didn ' t tell us what it ' s supposed to be about .
well , i ' m glad you did . and i ' m sorry . why don ' t you tell me about it .
what did you do to your neck ?
hey you hear the news . i just got a job at a new firm : `` <person> , <person> ' em and <person> . `` yuk yuk .
<person> ' t i tell you to knock before you came in here ?
at the party .
toward the end . you remember ?
as a matter of fact i ' ve read it .
well , good for you .
but why would a star like her come to a product seminar in a little one-horse town like this ?
this is where the real people live , <person> . her real fans , like you .
who ? they ' re all testifying . everybody who was in the o . r . ' s going to take the stand .
all right . who wasn ' t in the o . r . ?
sshh . <person> back .
where is she ? did he hurt her ?
he wants help with his lines --
he was driving the car that hit <person> --
they ' re not going to --

wyatt , what ' re you talkin ' about ?

officers ' horses only . all other horses are to be auctioned immediately .

well . i don ' t know , <person> . what have you told him already ?
not much . he knows i don ' t have the highest opinion of him . and he knows i don ' t want to see him or know anything about him , ever . but i tried to keep it kind of neutral . <person> . i could go into a lot more detail , believe me .
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little <person> to death with a wine bottle ? <person> , man . it couldn ' t have worked out better . they ' re convinced <person> whacked <person> . i can ' t talk ' em out of it . we should be celebrating . this thing worked out just like you said , only better .

<person> ' in watercolors , <person> ?
dolores .
now you ' re seeing reason .
no --
i ' m not gon na take it .
that ' s fine for you . but do i go back and say i interviewed <person> ? do i go back and say i missed the biggest story of the war ? or do i say <person> was stone cold dead -- that ' s the information , isn ' t it ? or do i say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol ' revolutionary campfire ? can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was . sympathetic ? journalists don ' t fall in love . which story do you want me to tell ?
gee , it ' s swell to see you , <person> . we miss you in toontown .

remind me not to slip .
what about the gold ?
what about it ?
a cowboy ?

<person> ?

timing is everything . he waited until you were primed . until you knew there was no other man you could ever love .
yes .
what are you talking about . this match box ?
it ' s got a lot of overhead to it . what do you do . spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen , that ' s all . so why do you need a living room and a dining room . <continued_utterance> why do ya need a back yard ?
<person> didn ' t sneak back in , right ? he ' s still at the other hospital ?

<person> , <person> , you owe me sixteen plus from the race , and you ' re in for over two grand on the books , so i tell you what . i ' ll wipe the slate clean . <continued_utterance> here ' s a thou until you get yourself set up . i can do no better than that .

<person> ?
and you believe her ?
i don ' t know . i want to see you .
no it ' s not .
no -- i know it ' s not . but it ' s kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we ' d be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state . and that means i don ' t want anybody running out at <number> : <number> or <number> : <number> , or whenever the bus happens to come in that day . now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school ? does your husband work in the area ? do you --
wow , check out that greenhouse . is that your wife ?
no , my wife ' s out of town . <continued_utterance> her husband .
the seven dwarves ? no .
those people drive you nuts .
<person> , lost control of himself . he . will be repentant .
you ' re <person> , aren ' t you ?
but the couch ' ll get dirty !
yeah , but she keeps getting it all over herself . <person> , this shit is sticky ! . we need cleaning fluid or something to get it off .
<person> , <person> , take it easy -- don ' t do anything stupid .
who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me ? ! <person> him against the tree again .
no . no . i ' ve never seen her before . i know you already think i ' m going out of my mind but i genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow . everybody seems to be in on it .
it ' s a lot of world for one man . you sure that ' s not wishful thinking , you wishing
<person> ? where are you going ? he goes out the door .
<person> , are you surviving ?
not to anyone at all . tell them that , okay ?

so where have you been staying ?
the bus station . <continued_utterance> it ' s not -so bad . i know the night janitor . and there ' s a broken locker i can put my stuff .
did you call the police ?
no . can you drive me home ? i ' ll bring you back in the morning .
who won ?
<person> . he won the competition !
that ' s a terrible thing to say . it ' s not possible .
have you asked him if he ' s married ? have you said , `` are you married ? ''
oh , never mind , don ' t worry . <person> night .
well , she ' s asleep at last ! we sang in har . hey , where is everybody ?
<person> ' t found a mine for half a mile , or more .
that don ' t mean nothing . iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we ' re in the clear .
that ' s all right . i got it .
it ' s just new drapes and curtain rods . if i had known it was going to be so heavy i would have had them delivered up to the house . <continued_utterance> i just got tired of looking at the old drapes . my mother made them . had them long as i can remember . you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ? bobby yes , i have . <continued_utterance> ' course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i don ' t hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things . bobby i . can ' t . argue . <continued_utterance> this is it . <continued_utterance> thank you , <person> .
- <person> up !
you have to excuse <person> : she thinks she ' s on a ' seduce and destroy ' mission through life . . but she won ' t kill us .
so you fucked a student ? !
that ' s not what i ' m sayi --
really ? she doesn ' t enjoy all the adulation ?
she hates having to port in with her fans . it ' s too intimate .
there ' s my point exactly .
what ? what ' s your point ?
not dad ' s ?
well it ain ' t mine , dear . he got that after the fighting at transvaal . after he ' d been hurt , and he ' d saved some other lads , and well . i don ' t know what else , he won ' t tell me either . but the first day he got home he just . tossed them out . first day he could walk , he threw `em straight in the dustbin , and wouldn ' t hear a word i said not to . <continued_utterance> see , what you done today , you and <person> , you ' re chuffed up now , and so you should be , my splendid boy . it ' s good to be proud when you done something good . but what he done , in africa , whatever it was , he takes no pride in it . <person> as it surely was , and however much pain it ' s cost him , he refuses to be proud of killing , i suppose .
i ' ve been thinking about that . a birthday celebration when we ' re on the brink of war .
your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their king at a time like this .
why ? !
because i needed the money ! we needed the money .
what time is it ?
what ' s the matter ?
if it ' s okay with you i ' m going to <person> ' s to do my homework .
it ' s a school night . back by nine .
he wants two hundred dollars , but it ' s just plain stealing .
we left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed .
what ?
i know ! and his wife is six months pregnant .
that ' s not the way i hold it .
well , the way you hold it is wrong .
and , of course , the u . n . must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast . <continued_utterance> and the second condition ?
time is of the essence .
you can ' t tell anybody about this .
i know . i know . but i ' m saying , if they knew . we ' re going to be millionaires , man . <person> !
then make him give me the money . it ' s mine , i earned it . it ' s $ <number> . <number> already .
he won ' t . he says he ' ll keep it for when you really need it .
what ! ? what ! ?
i did it ! i got the box open .
you ' ve got a gift for them . <person> with horses . it ' s god- given . i can always spot it .
my father used to say that to me .
oh . <continued_utterance> agent desmond , it ' s .
it ' s late , <person> .
i have the navy reception this evening . i ' ll be home quite late . unless you ' ve changed your mind about coming ?
do you wish me to come ?
<person> , <person> !
great .
and i have accepted .
his freedom is not yours to offer !
oh .
. since <person> . you don ' t remember this ?
and now the only thing you ' re putting on sticks are corn dogs .
<person> .
-- <person> wasn ' t killed here . he was dumped here . out of a vehicle . <person> tread . <person> held on with baling wire . <continued_utterance> the man you want . stepped outta the car , dragged <person> out , laid him down . then walked over here and made a circle in the earth with a stick . i can ' t find the stick . he stuck an eagle plume in the circle , got back in his car , dustin ' his own prints with a pine bough for about six feet , but he missed a print , right here , see . he got in his car and went hell- bent-for-holy-sunday outta here . he ditched that pine bough three miles across the flat , in the little bear river , it floated down to <person> . the car hit paved road , and was outta here . <continued_utterance> the killin ' was done where <person> ' s mother lives . but he was driven here into these badlands . <continued_utterance> big sonuvabuck . based on the depth of that print , pressure releases . i ' d say he goes two-ten , two-fifteen --
bullshit .
sure -- i just about believe you .
hey , <person> -- what ' s on a tree ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! way to go , <person> -- pretty smart . oh , i was wondering , <person> -- i wanted to ask you something : how ' s the world treating you ? <continued_utterance> rough ! yeah , i know what you mean .
it ' s for <person> . our dead homie .
you checked out , right ?
what is it ?
look for yourself .
you do . you ' re handsome and charming .
i meant he ' s a doctor .
i understand that .
and we do hope to avoid litigation .
great place . no wonder the guttmans wanted it . i really feel bad about barging in like this .
forget it . i understand .
<person> affirmatively . <person> . keep those answers to three words . you weren ' t ' part of a group , ' you were her anesthesiologist . <person> ' t that right ?
yes .
oh . i didn ' t know you were here .

why ?
the tv didn ' t work .

you ' re not gon na give up on me , are ya ?
there were still cars when i got here . i thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow ?
what time is it ?
what do you mean , <person> my own place ?
i mean i --
how ' s that different from the regular <person> ?
instead of the north pole , he lives in spain . and instead of elves he ' s got an enforcer named <person> . basically he ' s like your santa , only scarier .
do you love me ?
what ?
who ?
asshole who ran us off the road .
you could ' ve heard about her coughing up blood in a shit box with no heat . having me rub her down with holy water , because she didn ' t have no insurance . all the while waiting for your pal jesus to save her . did your man tell you that ?
i ' m sorry , <person> .
there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand .
oh .
i appreciate your gesture , <person> , but if you don ' t mind i ' d rather you left me alone .
you have changed , <person> .
yeah . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na start fighting .
that right ?
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?
your dad taught you everything .
no .
well , i never heard of him either . but this was one brave son-of-a- bitch . <person> for the confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another . then after the war he ran and won the governorship of louisiana -- twice !
he ' s delusional ! <person> to what he ' s saying ! `` thor . `` `` bifrost . `` `` mjolnir . `` these are the stories i grew up with as a child !
i ' d just be driving him out there , that ' s all .
c ' mon , <person> . he ' s only a game character . and i didn ' t like the way he was messing with my mind .
<person> ' t you ? you didn ' t like that and so you killed him ?
there were some noises . i didn ' t want to disturb you .
what do you mean ? some noises where ?
a portuguese boyfriend . <person> very `` cosmo . ``
you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
he ' s in one of his pleasant moods , i see --
he ' s got the shanks . we got the makings of a greek tragedy here .
fore . !
i ' m glad i ' m well out of it .
that how you planned it ? you take cut <person> , get me to hang it on kelly , then dump me in the ocean .
come off it , man . it was an accident .
oh yes !
can ' t we go tomorrow ?
what ! what ! oh shit ! oh no ! <continued_utterance> what do we do ? what do you want to do ? !
i don ' t know ! <person> ! let ' s just play it by ear . he may not know . he may just give me a ticket .
after they ' re printed .
i ' ll develop them myself -- give it to me or i ' ll start taping what you say in your sleep .
buying <person> .
wan na come sailing ?
<person> , i thought i mentioned that to you .
no , you definitely didn ' t mention that .
you ' re bleeding .
it ' s nothing .
yes . <person> right now or right when i thought of it . the name and memory of <person> is haunting me . lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again . because it is only a feeling , i am powerless to stop it . and another thing , <person> , when the next murder happens you will help me solve it .
<person> ' s test it for the record . will the next victim be a man or a woman ?
what ? what ' s unfinished ?
i have a short follow through -- my swing can look unfinished .
what ' s that ?
i work with retards .
then why isn ' t it in any of the other pictures ?
a cloud passed . or it ' s a bounce off the lake . <person> ? she looks . he might not be wrong .

<person> is a criminal .
<person> was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u . s . government . so , no , i don ' t have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government , fighting people like you , trying to keep this system a little bit honest .
<person> ? well i donandiacute ; t like to talk about my past .
maybe , the professor could help you with that .
i just told you -- he hit a deer .

<person> ' t let her . i believe in this , i completely believe in this . it happened to <person> , at least six times .
and she was wrong every time .
wow . hey , how ' d you know my name ?
you ' re labelled .

you came out of nowhere . you bolted out of no place . bolted out of nowhere .
<person> ! at six miles an hour i ' m bolting into the street ! you schmuck ! you schmuck !
i doubt it was drugs , more likely a problem with a nerve . i could recheck the arm for injuries , but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland .
i think that ' s a good idea . <continued_utterance> i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park .
how is he doing ?
as long as he keeps his throat clear , he is able to get some rest .
all i can tell you is . i ' m on a mission for the king .
i ' ve heard that one before .

<person> lousy bucks .
reading other people ' s mail is not only impolite , it ' s illegal .
<person> don ' t mind . he likes i read his mail . saves him the time . plus a lot of folks around here can ' t read , so it ' s more a public service , really .
we ' ve driven a long way . where is this place ?
maybe it was just a dream . ya know , just one of them , what do ya call ' em , fitful dreams ?
it has its charms . y ' know , by finishing in the top <number> at the open you qualified to be in it next year --

<person> ' s gon na be looking for a take down .
can ' t you have a normal conversation ?
i don ' t want to have any conversation .
are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl ? or are you gon na save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her ?
dont fuck with me , man . you look like a clown in that stupid jacket .
new hushpuppies don ' t make a new man .
you ' ve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers .
you never walked away dad . you could have walked away .
i ' m just so scared of that song . that fucking , `` my son just arrived the other day . he says thanks for the ball , come on let ' s play . i got lots of bills come again next day . he ' s grown up just like me . my boy is just like me . `` <person> fucking <person> , <person> , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .
yeah , and you obviously still have a hard-on for the doctor chick -- your face is all screwed up and tight like you haven ' t been laid in awhile --
is it really that obvious ?
i mean my father .
a father is nothing but sperm , ted .
twenty to one .
i don ' t see <person> winning . fuck it , i ' m not gon na even place the bet . i just made a hundred bucks .
the leadership of our district . the diener . <person> is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except <person> , of course . he came the first day . i think he saved your life .
can i have something to drink ? <continued_utterance> does anybody know i ' m here ?
<person> , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of --
that ' s not what i ' m sug --
how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .
there .
juvenile intrusion ! repeat !
yes .
where ? . in the leg ?
i know . but if i do .
yeah . you should go outside .
<person> , damn , hurts looking at you .
now with a line like that , it ' s a shocker i haven ' t already .
i felt you . looking through me .
we walked all night .
well , that ' s very nice of him .
that ' s not my dad . that ' s my nephew --
full stop ! ! ! call the captain !
<person> !
this is a face made for television .
you decided to go with the network .
we just found the ultimate centerfold for `` the girls of xenia ! '' <person> sobers , pulls away .
i have to be honest with you , ted . i really despise `` the girls of xenia . ``
oh my , there sure is a lot of skin coming through there .
i ' m guessing that ' s what the soprano shriek was about , pumpkin .
are you pissed off ' cause she ' s gone ?
of course not ! what , are you crazy ? i ' m relieved ! <person> she ' s out of here !
yeah , <person> .
we ' re in deep shit over here . <person> ' s change that plan .
<person> . <person> at me . you can not ride .
<person> used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall .
ours . it ' s one of ours . we ' ve got to signal them ; let them know we ' re down here .
no .
however , while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue , the united states can offer a private assurance . <continued_utterance> our jupiter missiles in turkey are obsolete , and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time . this withdrawal should be completed within , say , six months . <continued_utterance> of course , any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government .
this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority ?
yeah .
the entire army-navy store . sold out ?
what ?
a ride . you want one ?
make love to you i would think .
then why don ' t you ?
the owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it .
we couldn ' t have dropped a cigarette because we don ' t smoke .
pulsating laserlight !
total annihilation !
you might say we had a meeting of the minds , yes .
did you know that mrs . <person> and <person> are wanted in connection with a murder ?
is <person> in there ?
not anymore .

she ' s my wife , <person> . so that ' s it ? i stay with tess and i never get to see you guys again ? not a single phone call ? nothing ? <continued_utterance> god , man , i don ' t understand this . you won ' t forgive me , but you ' ll forgive <person> ?
shit . he ' s just some old vet i train with . he means nothing to me . from what i hear he means nothing to you , either , so you got balls talking about forgiveness .
august loves his sideshow freaks . there ' s a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest . he dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leather shoes . no talent but a real money- maker with the rubes . calls himself the man and a half . <person> ' ll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony .
what happened to this circus ?
all right .
are you over at dr . <person> ' ?
<person> , my god !
<person> , what ? <person> , what is it ?
great .
would you like a little clam-dip , honey ?
maybe <person> ' s attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
i thought of that . then i said , come on , you ' re <person> . your reputation is getting trashed . you want to stop the bleeding . you don ' t want to sit in jail for three months . unless .
there ' s money . a lot .
where ?
when the lights went out .
would have been a perfect time .
hattie , do you still dance ?
i ' m in church .
what ? ! did we just meet ? how long we been partners ? no , i ' ve never lived with a girl !
boy , oh boy ! did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today ?
<person> ? ! <continued_utterance> are you sure the original suppression took ?
absolutely , sir . he thinks he ' s <person> , a computer .
where ' s m ?
soon she ' ll be everywhere .
oh , that wasn ' t my father .
what ?
since when do you get manicures ?
oh , i suppose you could never be with a woman who gets manicures .
exactly . the morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating : nymphomaniac , criminal , communist . anything along these lines . once you visit the set of her `attack of the atomic vampires , ' you ' ll see the void that is her character . we haven ' t a photograph handy , but she ' s playing the lead female role .
i ' m happy to help . but my price is $ <number> , <number> . not <number> .
is that all ?
just remember , i ' ll be watching .
take a vacation .
i ' m on vacation ! !
i slipped and hit my head on the mirror . the glass broke as it struck my head . it struck me as funny , <person> . do you understand me , <person> , it struck me as funny .
you are going right back to bed .
well , i called where <person> said he was gon na stay , and there was no answer , so i don ' t know if he ' s still in town or not . <continued_utterance> <person> ? are you not speaking to me ? <continued_utterance> well , i ' m sorry you ' re so mad at me , but i only did what i thought i had to do , and i hope you don ' t stay mad at me for the rest of your life . <continued_utterance> <person> , that ' s too much . <continued_utterance> you got ta cut this out !
what did i do ?
friend of mine , owns a club . <person> . you ' d know him if you saw him . his brother was in your class . <person> .
you didn ' t say what it was for , did you ?
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble . he stares right at magneto .
but you know that it is a war , old friend . and to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs , by any means necessary . and for that reason , i will always have the advantage . no matter how you trap me , how i am contained - chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation
where does he live ?
you mind telling me why you ' re looking for him first ?
well , <person> had the will in his pocket that night at the club . it was gone in the morning when the cops found the body .
maybe they just took it out of his pocket .
must be interesting to be a woman .
the idea ' s never occurred to me , sir .
<person> good .
my battery ' s going . i ' m a block away . see you in five minutes .
you want to book the flight ?
you were expecting me , weren ' t you ?
gentlemen , this is the end of the line . i hope you had a pleasant ride . unhitch the horses .
but the guards .

but which i can get . no problem . <person> , i can sell my car in vegas . <person> book it ' s worth <number> at least . i just need the <number> , uh . <person> looks like he ' s ready to pound heads . mr . arkady where are you ? bobby uh . a little shithole in arizona called superior . about <number> miles east of phoenix . mr . arkady superior , hunh ? <person> suddenly feeling suspicious . <continued_utterance> yeah , if you could send it care of .
<person> , you take a good look at me , baby , cause you gon na hafta watch close to know when we do it to ya .

your house is so beautiful .
thank you .
<person> . moscow-trained north korean nuclear weapons specialist ; apparently fell out of favor with the current north korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a british light-water reactor in south africa - an accident that left him entirely hairless . another face appears on the screen : col . dominique everhart and <person> , also known as <person> . freelance mercenary , <person> and cambodia . his father was from nepal - a ghurka warrior - con- scripted by the british government to fight in china during world war ii - after which the family settled in hong kong , where the young <person> was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the hong kong chinese , and local british . we ' ve all read about the signs at the british swimming pools in hong kong that said `` no ghurka ' s allowed . ``
nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful .
as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway . we ' re not that far . we can make it .
what do we do with the humvee ?
<person> ' t take any wooden nickels <person> .
i won ' t .

you kiss your mother with that mouth ?
i ' d kiss your mother with this mouth . i mean , if she wasn ' t , you know .
you ' re going to blow yourselves up .
wes is right . if there were any more mines we would have found them . <person> , that one you stepped on was probably old anyway ; left over from the war with iran .
got you a pack of mores again , huh ?
<person> , its a real problem for me , sailor , you know ? when i went in that drugstore by the restaurant in biloxi ? i saw em by the register and the girl throw em in . im not big on resistin . so what about a leech ?
the other thing is .

<person> around ?
he ' s up at the <person> out .
all in all , i ' m happy and look forward to further growth in this rich , intellectual environment .
that ' s it ? nothing else about me ?
<person> , and you ' d probably dump the poor guy halfway to katmandu .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
i jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked . now it ' s totally fucked ! this is a disaster !
i . i was nervous , but i didn ' t panic .
listen man , i think i have a problem .
we all have problems .
we know <person> gunmen killed our chief of intelligence , francisco . we know you killed police commanders in tijuana and mexico city . why do you resist ?
my father is rich . he ' ll pay you .
i wish we could stay here . just be here forever and ever . make it a little home .

she ' s too powerful , <person>
a true magician , <person> , never surrenders . she is a sorceress -- i am a sorceress ! transform me now and i will destroy her ! <person> !
it won ' t work - they ' re cavalry
let ' s try .

i don ' t know that anything could have prevented what happened .
<person> , uh . my name is <person> . <person> twisp . my father ' s name is <person> .

it ' s a lot of money , tess .
i don ' t give a shit about the money , brendan . i told you that . we ' re gon na end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money .
this is from the highest authority ?
yes . from the highest authority . there are two conditions . the u . n . must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles .

you ' ve never seen it ! ? you ' ve never seen it ! ? you put your feet on it to watch tv . the hand-embroidered footstool .
you ' re not safe on your own .

what ' s your idea of the whole night ?
two hours tops .
no . i was unconscious .
she ' s not gon na come down here with the two puppies , screaming at frank ?
i think you know . the timetable has been set . it will happen on a holiday , when people are away from their homes . when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country . the president will declare a state of emergency , at which time all federal agencies , all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency . fema , <person> . the secret government .
and they tell me i ' m paranoid .
<person> . ok . but the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures . according to these figures , you ' re upside down on your mortgage --
you said that three times already . i get that . but i ' m asking you if there ' s something else you can do . not the bank , you . can you shift things around , restructure --
' you guys are a bunch of whores . uh . loyalty . you don ' t care who gets hurt . you don ' t have any loyalty . '
. one of the other nurses ?
<person> . i will .
you don ' t have to go if you don ' t want to , honey .
that was beautiful . i feel . just like me . is that kind of transition normal , a kind of smooth dissolve from place to place ?
depends on the style of the game . you can get jagged , brutal cuts , slow fades , shimmering little morphs .
ohmigod .
wow .
dr . <person> is in the trunk .
let me out . stop the car .
thank you .
this all happened because of you , didn ' t it --
oh . <person> , <person> . would you pass the salt ?
and don ' t call me <person> .
maybe . but it seems i have some enemies i didn ' t know i had . `` death to <person> . `` how ' d you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming , `` death to <person> '' ?
wow . hey , how ' d you know my name ?
you amped the neural connectors back up , didn ' t you ? you ' re the reason the convict died .
i couldn ' t just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty . i ' m a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .

that good , hub ?
no . <continued_utterance> i had to finish something with <person> .
that ' s where you were . you had to go back and have it out with the indian law . <continued_utterance> you fucking hot head , we can get in trouble for that .
so you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business .
that ' s right , boss .
. <person> . i think <person> only knows those two trails . well . between those , i ' d pick <person> . <person> will shoot you to the top , but there ' s not as much to see . <person> weaves through <person> ' s <person> , it ' s a better hike and prettier all around view .
what do you think ?
yeah .
how are your grades ?
standard equipment . the world ' s automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders .
i must say , q , you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement .
i have more sense than to give up everything , my family , you and sunny . it wasn ' t me , i mean the real me inside my body . i ' m glad it ' s over . it ' s like a veil has been lifted .
like a veil has been lifted ?
m . c . , i ' m worn out . you ready to go ?
if you are tired , go sit in the car .
iandiacute ; ve served with men like you before . methodical . systematic -- naive . you know what happens to those men in a real fight ?
you know , you --
then he will be when those iraqis get to him . he was going to kill you . he was one blink away from it . he ' s dead , <person> , and i ' m sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass . <continued_utterance> it ' s a helicopter .
there .
no ! i want him out of here ! <continued_utterance> go on , beat it .
as the tension builds .
it ' s beautiful .
<person> ' t wear it in the pool .
watch your mouth , will you ? i ' m in love with that young lady .
<person> ' t she speak softly like everyone else ?
actually , <person> , i don ' t know .
<person> , if this is a dysfunctional --
<person> away from that window .
you ' re gon na help me ? how can i ever thank you ?
of course .
what ' s this ?
i never said you couldn ' t be killed . i never said that .
you have a problem , <person> . my wife is right . somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it .
<person> never sleeps pal . when i came in in ' <number> , they traded six hours a day , now the clock don ' t stop , london ' s deregulated , the orient is hungrier than us . just let the money circle the world , sport , buying and selling , and if you ' re smart it comes back paying . i just made $ <number> , <number> in hong kong gold . it ' s been wired to you -- play with it . you done good , but you got ta keep doing good . i showed you how the game works , now school ' s out .
mr . <person> , i ' m there for you <number> % .
i ' ve got to have something to tell people when i get home besides i protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place .
the longer the air force hits the iraqis , the safer it ' ii be for us when we have to engage .
what do you mean ?
i mean they didn ' t tell us what it ' s supposed to be about . they said do whatever you want .
tell me more about what that boy did , <person> .
well , first he ' d always swim over to the side of the pool and hold himself there -- make sure he righted himself . then . before he knew it . he ' d be standing .
<person> . yes . yes . <number> . <number> at <number> . <number> for <number> . at <number> . <number> at <number> . i ' m amazed the windows don ' t blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed , ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards .
i just want her to be happy .
but something went wrong . something about a real memory . and then those men . tried to kill me .
what men ? <person> , you ' re crazy . <continued_utterance> you ' re here now . they didn ' t kill you .
maybe we should split it up now .
we started this together , and we ' re staying together , so there ' s no point in splitting things up now .
oh , no -- i just keep picking it up and putting it back in again .
ohhh --
you promised me answers . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> b .
what you seek -- it ' s a bridge .
we ' ve got our problems , but let ' s try and isolate this particular situation .
isolate . isolate . i like this kind of talk . what the hell nonsense is that ?
unfortunately we ' ve already re-let the room . we ' d rather the guests didn ' t know about the incident .
<person> ' t worry . i ' ll be discreet .
<person> down . . turn that thing on . <continued_utterance> now hold him .
i ' m a real light sleeper , childs .
i don ' t know -- i ' m a med student . i ' m just babysitting . i only met her a couple hours ago .
oh , i see . <continued_utterance> <person> , on second thought , i don ' t think i ' ll wait for her . just give her this when she gets back , okay ? and this is for the baby .
it does indeed , <person> .
and what do you do when you wake up to that ?
when a superior officer tells you to leave the room , you leave the fucking room .
i made a file on the bledsoe broad .

no , i mean how would you do it ? do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what ?

<person> . did you get him out of the lake ?
no . he ' s a city fish .
her stool ? did you look at it for parasites ?
i don ' t like looking at my own .
still trying to make the world safe for our kind . still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively .
you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me , <person> .
you ' re perceptive too . i forgot to add that to the list of surprises . i ' m with the national security agency . and unlikely as it may sound , i need your help .
i ' m not interested . i ' ve already got a job .
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin ' the other day .

-- a life most suckers can ' t dream of '' !
look ! right there ! <person> . and <person> !
look at these balls . <person> new titleists . <person> ' em , every one a brand new titleist . sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance . we swipe enough free shit we might even pay for this fiasco .
<person> <person> . fbi . i like the way ya sneaked up on me . must be indian .
what are you --
no . what does that mean ?
it means you shouldn ' t be taking care of another kid . especially a convict .
oh , god .
are you all right ?
schroeder .
yes , sir .
<person> , do you think we should change cars , get another car ?
sure . you know how to hotwire a car ?
yes . now i talked to <person> and there ' s a guy , this pakistani guy down in <person> .
<person> ?
<person> , he ' s not looking inside . he ' s just striking out at the world .
he has a lot of hurt inside him .
fuck they are . this is a government convoy to calunda .
this is the abou-deian revolutionary front .
if they launch it , i know how to bring it back .
<person> ' s do this . <continued_utterance> where ' s he headed ?
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
<person> pages ?
you won ' t believe this . but this is me smiling .
it ' s been a long time . i tried to see you but your people wouldn ' t let me .
all my things have me in them . i don ' t want you to be like me .
but i love you , <person> .
we did a story on this guy . he owns half of arizona .
is he a fraud ?
there is something in their common sense attitude to life . <person> , i speak to you as a friend . more , as a brother . if that machine can do what you say it can . destroy it . destroy it , <person> , before it destroys you .
you must have plans for new year ' s eve . <person> ' t let me keep you .
are you out of your mind ! ? ! <continued_utterance> now you just listen to me . i may not be the greatest mother in the world , but i ' m doing the best i know how . and he doesn ' t need you to rub his face in shit because you think it ' s good for him . he ' s going to find out the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough , and without any help from you . believe me ! <continued_utterance> i think you should get your own place . i thought , if you want , you could -- i ' ll be glad to help you out financially --
what do you mean , <person> my own place ?
what ' ve i got to lose ? you okay , <person> ?
yeah . they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
yes , the chief . <person> stuff . any survivors ?
two . there ' s a guy in county hospital , but he ' s in a coma . the d . a . has the other guy - a cripple - from new york i think . <person> , the chief said -
i put in both your sweaters . you wear them now , the nights are so chilly up there .
<person> . i will .
four . you ' re great with these kids .
thank you .
are you writing another book ?
i ' m in the home stretch . i ' ll be done in approximately six more years .
who ' s this `<person> ' clown anyway ?
not important .
i really don ' t know what to say .
well , you ' re here . and we ' re here . together . we ' ll think of something .
tell mr . <person> i ' ve got important financial news ! it concerns his future . <continued_utterance> what the hell .
<person> . buy it .
<person> ?
sweated up like a stuck pig . and be careful . he was fucking around with his front door before he left . i don ' t know what he was doing .
where ever you want . she could come here or we could go see her at leo ' s house . she moving in this morning .
i ' ll go see her at leo ' s before practice . but i want to go alone .
i don ' t see the sheep .
the lord will provide the sheep .
nobody would believe us . we ' d still get in trouble . we ' d still have our lives ruined . and you know what else ?
what ?
i knew i ' d like you .
why ' d you point at me that day ?
mr . <person> made a few calls , yes . you were not to be released until i came to see you . it seems mr . <person> ' s attorney , ms . <person> , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . holding the rest of you became a moot point .
what about <person> ?
i just want to know why you told me not to move , and you ran .
because i honestly thought he ' d go for me . i thought i was doing you a favor . apparently not appreciated .
the job looks okay to us . but look at it from his point of view . the man ' s surrounded by wealth and privilege . but for him . it ' s just a reminder of what should have been his . <continued_utterance> your old man graduates from <person> , you ' re not supposed to wind up there . <person> of <person> maybe , but not in the lousy guidance office . now . <person> number two . i ' ve run a financial on <person> . <person> was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like <person> .
so what about the girls ? <person> ' s poor , but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother ? surely her father . <continued_utterance> this one ' s got you working overtime , hasn ' t it ?
your honor !
yes , mr . <person> ?
so much .
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away .
<person> . what if they ' re not saudi . <continued_utterance> if it ' s a checkpoint , it could be iraqi . <person> considers this .
we ' ve got no cboice . <person> way , we ' ve got no choice .
i ' m in church .
what does that got to do with it ?
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . we thought there ' d been another fatality , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
have you examined them ?
you ' re saying the bombing was a cover-up . of what ?
i don ' t know . but i have a hunch what you ' re going to find here isn ' t anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .
well , he wasn ' t very likable .
why do you say that ?
<person> hook ! <person> , what a stupid idea hiding the shit with this kid . it ' s ridiculous !
oh , thank god , you ' re still here ! there ' s been a terrible mistake . that wasn ' t the package you were s ' posed to take . it was another one . i have it right here .
there ' s a reason for that .

the new york literary world was shocked this week when <person> , the most famously reclusive author since j . d . <person> , announced that he was coming out of hiding because of his loyalty to a small children ' s bookstore on the west side of manhattan . discussing this tonight is a man i happen to think of as one of this city ' s most underappreciated assets , <person> .
thank you .
you think the girls are in trouble ?
they will likely notify their parents . perhaps even expel them .
and i know damn well you did .
well , you ' re wrong .
it ' s gorgeous .
yup . there are a couple more falls in the park , but none quite so . inviting as this one . now don ' t take my word for it , you can see for yourself . how long ' s your stay ?

he ' s cracked up .
he is not cracking up .
mainly i work out of boston .
boston , huh ? did you get your degree up there ?
yes . a man with ink in his veins , and blood on his hands .
we print <number> newspapers here ; another two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite plants around the world .
. <person> ' t get all .
. like it never even happened .
what do you mean ?
<person> or <person> ?
it means that they want you in the back room . they need more insect boards for the pod assembly bays .

<person> .
do you need some money ?
i was being sincere !
you ' re incapable of sincerity .
could be . <continued_utterance> my mother ' s buried near here .
my father ' s alive but it ' s like he ' s dead . <continued_utterance> what is that ?
. and he ' s making a billion dollars every minute working for <person> , <person> , and he bought a dog , and everything is rosy . then mr . <person> , he tried to fix a case .
the big boy did . ?
in my office , after <person> day .
<person> ?
i like it . and think of the toppings -- cheese , mushrooms , mint jelly
not to mention ketchup and hot peppers .
this informant , paid by the police , using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit , was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm . a working farm . a farm where honest americans make their living . <continued_utterance> the government , in its haste , has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is , at best , questionable -- judge <person> interrupts --
mr . <person> . it ' s too bad your client didn ' t show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney . <continued_utterance> lately the only variation i ' m hearing in your argument is the name of the client . and you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of illinois v . <person> , but you aren ' t going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants . furthermore , there is no sacred protection of property rights in the united sates . when you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm , whether it ' s one joint or an acre of plants , your property can be seized and your property can be sold .
sure . fifteen years ago , but he was a good thief <person> , the cops wouldn ' t let him go legit .
<person> was a piece of shit .

what do i want with grecian candlesticks !
just do it ! this is no time for small talk .
some limey . he ' s a middle-man for somebody . he doesn ' t say and i don ' t ask .
we want to meet him .
i should have told him .
<person> ' t blame yourself . in your shoes , i don ' t think i would have told <person> , either . so do you think <person> has become the dominant personality ?
you ' re my son .
what more than that ? <continued_utterance> the casket wasn ' t the only thing you took from jotunheim that day , was it ?
yep .
that ' s two people in one day who wanted to actually kill you .
what else have you been giving him ?
i crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea .
<person> ! this is <person> ! get out of your basement ! ! take your radio ! you and <person> get up on your roof ! then we ' ll talk , okay ? !
<person> ? what the hell you doing back already ?
. and this . <continued_utterance> no no , not necessary . he belongs to you . that is , of course , what my little girl would have wanted . and she was the boss .
what was her name ?
are you looking for mr . <person> ?
yeah .
ms . <person> . i ' m asking you now , under oath , did <person> rape you ?
this wasn ' t my idea .
we ' re in town to play the dolphins .
i called him . i told him to pick up <person> and get over here . everyone turns their attention to ted . ted <person> , i found out that your buddy <person> there lied to you about <person> . <person> lowers his head . ted <person> never said anything bad about <person> . he loves <person> . and from what he just told me on the phone , he loves you , too . he ' s the guy you should be with .
that ' s a lie .
let us settle this tomorrow .
<person> , we need to get you out of this parking lot . my trucks have to come through here . please . <continued_utterance> i got it russ . take the walker . finish closing up the ticket booth .
in my day , they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow . <person> kid didn ' t even know what the spec was .
i have found something here which makes waking up in the morning remotely bearable and the two of you stand there .
<person> , i need for you to be practical and realistic .
no . nothing like this .
for first-timers , i recommend either <person> or <person> .
consciously you didn ' t mean it like that -- but how about unconsciously , you ' re the expert , did you mean it unconsciously ?
unconsciously , <person> , i don ' t have a clue what i ' m talking about .
planning on going to war all by your lonesome ?
just . want to be ready when we do .
and they want to blame us ?
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and <person> hadn ' t taken the initiative to search the adjacent building , you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
i don ' t know what you mean .
i mean , did you ask her ? what kind of drugs has she tried ?
that is your dream , not mine . my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine .
<person> your tone , mister .
what ? what is it ?
it ' s very hard for me to come and tell you this . <continued_utterance> it ' s <person> . he ' s going to do something stupid . i ' m worried that he ' ll get himself killed . <continued_utterance> he ' s saying he ' s going to talk to the americans . become an informer .
shut your pie-hole . you look fine .
i look like an idiot .
are you kidding ? she had her flashlight trained on your hindi boner !
no need to be jealous , <person> .
nothing you wouldn ' t have done it my place !
i always knew you ' d end up in a crow ' s cage .
i ' d just like to say thank you to mr . <person> for giving me the chance to play the role of a star designer . i guess the game picked up on my ambitions to be like you .
well , let me first say that i ' m kinda glad i lost this game . i don ' t usually play such nasty characters . <continued_utterance> and , <person> , you were so good in that role that i suspect it won ' t be long before pilgrimage is after you to sign a designing contract . and maybe you should take your friend <person> , here , mr . <person> , with you . he ' s obviously good in a crisis , and when you design games , there are plenty of them .
<person> ' ll know about <person> .
<person> ?
that ' s bullshit ! <person> out that door , i ' m changing the locks .
you may not believe this <person> but i really do care for you . i think we could ' ve made a good team . but that ' s how it goes .
i want a full-scale investigation .
you know what that will mean for <person> .
we ' ve got to get you some help now . you won ' t make it to morning . i ' m going to try and hike back to the gas station-
how far do you think you ' d get out there before running into mr .
i suppose that ' s a possibility . that ' s what i tell my statistics class anyway ; life is a game of chance . endless possibilities and permutations . you just have to calculate the odds .
you haven ' t answered the question .
he interrupted a duel i was fighting .
also punishable by death .
no more women for me , <person> .
<person> ? must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays .
what a lovely notion , darling . you go ahead downstairs and get things started .
what are you doing ?
you ' re not like my other students , <person> . so what was the movie you two saw ?
huh ? oh . <person> or fury . with <person> and <person> .
you know , this is as much your fault as it is mine .
<person> , we don ' t have time for this -
i am worried about the king ' s .
what do you mean ?
yes .
why would i do that ? why don ' t i just leave , period ?
i wan na be a chiropractor like my dad .
tell the class what a chiropractor does , <person> .
<person> ' t jerk me off . we all know what this is . you don ' t work with me if i work with you without knowing who i ' m working for . now let ' s cut the shit . who ' s the man ?
i work for <person> .
<person> that .
we ' re going to get court martialed , you know that .
i know , <person> , but we ' re running for our lives ! <person> ' t you think you could make an exception just this once ? ! i mean , look at the map . the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas !
thelma ! i ' m not gon na talk about this ! now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will ! you understand ?
<person> didn ' t have any relatives living , did he ?
<person> was in the world by himself .
i ' m not hanging . i ' m fixing my car --
you don ' t need a car you can ' t drive for a month . go see <person> .
with my hands ?
do it !
so if there are alternatives that make sense - and i ' m not saying there are - we need ' em . <person> ' em fast .
what about the allies ? congress ? i think we may need to start letting key people know . and they ' re all scattered across the country for the campaign . we ' re going to need to get the u . n . staff in and warmed up . <person> . i don ' t even know if we ' ve got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours .
you really don ' t get it , do you ? i am genetically programmed to desire a big , buff , manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring ! it ' s , like , a caveman thing !
so that ' s a maybe ?
i like them both .
you can ' t have both . there ' s a law .
i think you ' ve had enough tea for today . <person> ' s get you out of here , <person> .
<person> ' t you get it ? ! you see the hat ? i am mrs . <person> ! !

back then i had intricate systems with women you wouldn ' t believe .
we can do this . we can get her out of here .
have you completely lost your mind ? so you get her out of here . so you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you don ' t think at some point somebody might notice that she ' s gone ?
there is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball .
i ' m afraid to ask . what ' s the other theory ?
sure . <continued_utterance> you want an umbrella with that ?
nah . i ' m good . but keep these coming . <person> checks a ticket and prepares two drinks . <continued_utterance> so how you doing , pal ?
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .
where ' s <person> ?
he ' s dead - good and dead .
because i picked the lock on these handcuffs . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t move .
what is it ?
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
they ' re ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it ' s only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy <person> . then we ' re gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
of course not . i ' m taking a vacation . this isn ' t an appointment , i ' m dropping by . i told the guttmans what you said and they found me a cottage nearby .
no .
grip it and rip it .
while i appreciate your poetic sensibility , mr . mcavoy --
land ! are you crazy ? i ' m no amishman and i ' m no farmer ! i ' m a cop . that ' s what i know and that ' s what i do !
what you do is take vengeance ! <person> is a sin against heaven !
what ' s weird is how they disappeared . <person> ' t make sense . <person> ' t . <continued_utterance> scatter !
where is it ? where ' d it go ?
mr . <person> ?
that ' s right .
take what out ? i ' m not taking anything out .
wait a minute , i don ' t get it ! we take the basket and the milk , that ' s all . we ain ' t gon na take the . what ' s inside .
he accused <person> of taking kickbacks . and you know anybody who knows <person> knows that ' s a goddamn lie !
of course , <person> . but as long as there ' s any question , better <person>ny should come back and clear his name .
<person> ? try stalkerish .
not if things worked out between us . i would ' ve told you everything eventually , and then it wouldn ' t be stalkerish . it would just be this sweet funny story we ' d have .
your majesty , france is on the brink of war . we dare not hesitate .
but these men are my personal guards .
because it <continued_utterance> what are you going to do ?
nothing .
you think i ' m naive .
no . i really don ' t . <continued_utterance> i dug her completely . <person> , i had found the last semi-guileless girl in new york city .
what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
got me . but unless the will shows up by friday midnight , it ' s theirs .
no i ' m not . have you really looked at me ? i ' m short ! even for a nelwyn ! <continued_utterance> why can ' t you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .
my prsence can not extend beyond this forest . but i can give you these . <continued_utterance> they will protect you . use them wisely .
hey , that wasn ' t very nice .
<person> , pal , if you ' re still here when i finish this drink , i ' m callin ' the police .
before we start taking calls , the huge surge in ratings over the last few days , how do you hope to sustain that audience now that <person> appears to have reconciled himself , returned to `` normal '' ?
ratings have never been our primary goal . i
you know , i ' d like to , but i did something to my neck -- i must ' ve slept on it funny -- those dungeon pillows are like rocks -- well , they are rocks -- so i should probably take it easy or i ' ll be no damn good for work tomorrow .
i said move !
oh .
that ' s okay , they ' ll be dry in just a second .
<person> , that ' s what i want . i don ' t need these bimbettes you got me chasing . i want what you have . a family . someone to . you know . love .
each day is better than the next . have you ever been , you know . in love with someone ?
what troubles you , <person> ?
i turned my gaze upon you in jotunheim , but could neither see nor hear you . you were shrouded from me , like the frost giants who entered this realm .
keeping the store open doesn ' t keep your mother alive , although sometimes i think we all think it does .
who was it , <person> ? that you had the thunderbolt over ?
why don ' t you show me some gear before you get hurt .
<person> to you . right away , sir , anything you say , sir .
depends what number you write . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
happily .
<person> ?
yeah . and throw it into <person> .
<person> .
<person> stultorum magister .
if <person> ' s the only one who can operate all this . . then he can call all the shots .
we ' ll tell him the computer ' s worked out the operational details so we don ' t really need him . we ' re just doing him a favor .
you sleeping with her ? <continued_utterance> i was cleaning yesterday . i found this . <continued_utterance> scuba dive . touch a moon rock . <person> to read egyptian hieroglyphs . go to college ? she talking to you ' bout this stuff ? <continued_utterance> <person> , some of this is . farfetched . you take after me . people skills and common sense .
i could take after dad , too .
from the beastie boys collection ?
it ' s a stakeout suit . it ' s got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it ' s all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
i guess so .
well , he doesn ' t live very far from here .
<person> , sir .
and how old are you , <person> ?
did you reserve the court ?
easy . i can ' t handle heavy conversation at this ungodly hour .
authority still makes me nervous .
<person> way ?
<person> up .
we created our own world together . <continued_utterance> where ' s brian ?
you ' d die for fun ?
<person> ' t you ? you ' re laughing ! i was sure you never laughed .
yes . yes , i have .
you know how beautiful she was ? her husband left her , and he took her kids . they , they , they ' d let you die in there . they don ' t care . nobody cares . the patriot home , the chronic care . in arlington . ? they ' d take her in . perpetual care . they ' d take her . <person> thousand dollars they want . an endowment .
no . my job is to get your head straight so you can qualify for the open , much less win it . to get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady .
not all my thinking occurs below the belt . i actually stand for a few things beside where my next romantic interlude is coming from .
good cop . bad cop .
that you ' re a <person> ' s boy ?
i left a message . i think it ' s going to be okay .
you sound funny . did you do cocaine ?
so what ' s supposed to happen now ?
just do exactly as we tell you .
that is called a crab apple switch . it ' s for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . now i don ' t know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk ' s stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home . i was up in memphis working on the railroad , like your daddy who had an easy job . he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . anyway i was coming down <person> and i heard this music coming from a saloon . sure enough it was <person> . my daddy taught both of us to play but <person> was natural at it . got in a blues band and what not . he and another boy had killed a boy named <person> sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town . <person> had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face . bad luck i would say . he got to drinking that corn liquor . we went to his girl ' s room and he wouldn ' t stop drinking . he started talking about the old days and he went mad . he pulled his knife and i got to mine first . the lights went out .
<person> ' t pick up the cards if you are not in the game . did he die ?
not anymore , not in the city .
we grow most of our own food . the money i get from social security , my pension and my wife ' s work , keeps us living on the edge . what choice do people like us have .
is it that bad ?
yeah . it is . i don ' t know how much longer i can keep my practice going .
<person> .
do you want a coffee ?
is that right ? where ?
deerfield and choate .
i don ' t want to go to mexico , <person> ! <person> , i really want to be with you . <person> ' t blow this . <person> ' t you think i care about you ?
i think you ' re a lying , back-stabbing psycho bitch , and one day you ' ll kill me . but it ' s nice to know you cared .
cause she ' s dead .
<person> , that ' s sad . <person> ' t that make you sad ?
yes you did . last night . to your friend
i didn ' t mean it that way .
just like you . only you were even easier . <continued_utterance> i told him he had to hurt me , he had to make it look real . when he refused i told him i would do it myself .
so you killed your father .
where ' s the fire sweetheart ? <person> ' t know how they work things in nevada , but we got speed limits in this state .
<person> ? i am going <number> miles an hour ! i am looking town . i not even moving .
hey ! <person> !
what ? what is it ?
my god .
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us . about our place in their colonization .
this is great , this is just great .
have you been out in the street ?
what is it ?
dr . <person> .
if you even have the smallest problem , call me personally and i ' ll just shoot you straight into the service department .
and i get a loaner if the car ' s got to stay ?
just , just a little coffee ?
maybe tomorrow .
he ' s awful cute .
so was the one in kansas city , and the one in <person> , ohio , and the one in waco , texas .
why didn ' t you tell me ?
the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible . i didn ' t want anyone being -- weird around me .
what do you know about spirits ? you ain ' t no in ' dn .
<person> knew something heavy and was trying to tell <person> . but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered . do you realize what <person> could have told <person> ? ! do you ? !
some old broad heard an `argument ' and buzzed <person> .
where ' s the family ?
correct . i don ' t .
or why we ordered it .
a rope !
no . the truth ! she thought i was dead -- those blades were meant for you . what do you know that she would kill you for ?
<person> . ! um , where ya going ?
i don ' t know . nowhere . what are you doin ' ?
<person> is a beautiful girl , with an extraordinary power . one that even
forty-eight hours , old man . but if you cross me , i wonandiacute ; t feel any guilt about what i do to you .
depends . those <person> ' s ?
everything ' s <person> ' s .
just go to the window and check her out .
you ' re pathetic .
now that ' s too bad . i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit ' cause you ' re gon na have to work this one off . <person> proffers his movado watch .
<person> , i got a movado . it ' s worth at least seven , eight hundred . you could sell it for that . darrell who the hell to ? shit , can ' t see no numbers . <continued_utterance> you don ' t need numbers . that ' s why it ' s expensive . <person> at the gold .
i can ' t think of anyone i ' d rather lie here with . <continued_utterance> <person> maybe <person> . if <person> were here , what do you suppose he would do to me ?
make love to you i would think .
it ' s a picture of joey . well , i never !
and there ' s a letter .
i got your message . but you went right to <person> , didn't you ? . i cant trust you , bitch - not for one minute . <person> girl . <person> and <person> are headed west , and guess what ? theres no turning back .
no .
. so am i . whaddaya want , a beer ? hey <person> , bring another for the kid , he looks good , doesn ' t he ? <continued_utterance> . looks like you grown another inch . but you don ' t look so hot , getting bags under your eyes , starting to look old like me .
ah , i had a tough day . some jerk d . k ' d me and i got ta cover his loss .
go for it .
it ' s like a to-do list , but for my life . <continued_utterance> if you can ' t imagine the future , you won ' t have one .
look at you , quarter to three and home already . what happened ? you and the fellas run out of things to talk about ?
please ! i ' m out there working myself to the bone , trying to make a living .
oh ! oh , come on , come on !
look -- you can see it here . it ' s wonderful !
well , then , you ' ll have to walk . the munchkins will see you safely to the border of munchkinland . and remember , never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment , or you will be at the mercy of the wicked witch of the west .
but , how do i start for <person> ?
<person> ! there are a lot of things in the world you don ' t understand , aren ' t there ?
of course ! quite a number .
yeah . grace is it far from here ? <continued_utterance> oh yeah . it ' s far , it ' s another world .

i ' d sooner wait outside .
<person> . it ' s letting up .
<person> , we can ' t make the poor fellow sit here all night . <person> ' s let him stay over .
. so it ' s in both our interests to put a safe distance between you and us . . this gives you limited power of attorney for mr . <person> ' s account . every trade you make is at your discretion . every ticket you buy must be marked `` power of attorney . `` that means you call the shots and mr . <person> has no official knowledge of what stocks you ' re buying . sign here and here .
. just the beginning , sport , just the beginning .
according to the newspaper , fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus . are you familiar with the hanta virus , <person> ?
it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u . s . several years ago .
what-
-- when did he start whoring out his own daughter to sweeten business deals ?
there ' s a body in the road , <person> .
be careful .
me too . i feel awake .
<person> .
here she is now .
dr . <person> ?
i hope you don ' t have any doubts about that .
if i did , i ' d have kept my mouth shut . it fits , <person> . fifty-five gallons of <person> <number> <person> confiscated four years ago . guess who was in on the collar ? mac . he salts it away somewhere . he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists haven ' t figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .
what do you mean ?
you ' re not gon na make some deal with that guy , are you ? i mean , i just wan na know .
we ' ll make it .
<person> ' t do this . send her a card - something .
a man doesn ' t always mean the things he says .
you meant it .
i am about this . <continued_utterance> what ?
he never would have believed a woman like you existed .
i think the ground ' s getting closer . i think we do it . we ' re gon na save our asses here !
<person> ! how are you going to know they ' re all following it ?
certainly not . we are here only briefly , in fact , until this evening , when we fly to austin , texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the cia .
he wants to take mr . <person> and me bass fishing .
that i want you to take me home .
now ? we just --
you ?
take a look at the second row . insert close up on the screen .
<person> .
you get mugged ?
yeah , that ' s right . you wan na come in and shake it for me ?
if you ' re gon na cheat , you might as well copy off somebody who ' s gon na get the answer right .
oh yeah ? and how do you think he should behave ?
i think he shouldn ' t have to run and tell his mommy every time he does something she might not like , for one thing .
what the hell is it ?
it looks like a cow .
help you ?
i ' m going to see dr . <person> .
i ' m looking . and i sure don ' t like what i see .
<person> enough . but it ' s not that simple , <person> . when i was down and had nothing , it was <person> who helped me . he got me all my clients -- you among them . and he can take it away like that . you may find out one day -- that when you ' ve had money and lost it , it ' s worse than never having had it at all .
a man is better measured by his life than by his death . your father was bold , and brave .
but you never knew him .
i have the same problem .
the kinds of urges other girls act on impulsively , i analyze until either the urge goes away or --
no , please !
ho there .
is she for real ? <person> , maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation .
my goodness , a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
did the plumber come ?
yes , the fucking plumber came .
who are you ?
i think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit , yeah ? this is the bear creek indian reservation .
-bag it until bradley orders us otherwise .
how do you solve a case when the evidence is in bags ?
you know -- let ' s really do it .
rape men in the park ?
`` the flying mountain . `` <person> and fandral groan .
not `` the flying mountain ! '' it threw out my back for a year last time !
it ' s her decision and she ' s decided not to tell people -- at least for now .
how -- how long does she have ?
oh my god .
but something went wrong . something about a real memory . and then those men . tried to kill me .
<person> ? can i ask you something ?
sure .
i ' d like to know something -- it probably doesn ' t matter in the great final scheme of things . but i ' m interested . did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me ?
no !
<person> shit .
tell me about it . i got ta be honest , <person> , it ' s not a good time for me . my business is off and my step son wants to get <person> .

i ' ve talked to your father .
congratulations . welcome to the club .

i ' ve been in prison , remember ?
the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho .
oh god ! what does that mean ?
im sure i wouldnt know , maam .
i don ' t know . i . maybe this is . last year i sort of thought you were possibly interested in that . idea . but i was the one who , you know , wasn ' t `` ready '' at that point -- so that ' s why i thought things kind of slowed down with us .
<person> ' t make me feel bad for you .
. please . please . please .
what are you doing ? she screams , spins around .
all right . this morning --
i ' m pregnant . <continued_utterance> i ' m sure .

i was just playing . we were playing just playing around .

mr . president ! mr . president !
<person> ' t play babe in the woods with me . i know that guy from the gym came to see you .

what ' s that ?
what did you say ?
why , <person> , whatever do you mean ?
come on , boys , take it easy .
you ' re okay ?
i ' m fine -- what ' re you doing here ? these guys are goons .
i ' m . mrs . <person> ? i ' m <person> . why didn ' t you go in ?

how do you know ? you take a first aid course or something ?
ski camp , seventh grade . <person> ' t make fun . what else do you have going on when you ' re thirteen ?
<person> , i know you don ' t like flattery but if anybody i know is going to win a nobel prize , it ' s you . you got ta be thinking about your next book so i know you ' ll find this case particularly interesting .
what sort of case is it , <person> ?
i told <person> .
does he still love you ?
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world ' s most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
i bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on <person> .
i ' m e . i . o . but i was your best friend . <person> - we arranged this .
i can ' t remember - only bits .
it tells me what every face tells me . everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want .
the same thing you do .
an old woman and her grandson .
can you tell me what their names were ?
come on , stop arguing , you two ! <person> , you ' re going to have to ask to do the new york-washington shu .
no ! never .
i ' m getting one for me , too . <person> ' t believe in doing anything halfway . if you ' re serious about the scouts . . then i want you to do it right . we ' ll do it right together . <continued_utterance> i got you a subscription to this . i ' ll take the price out of your paper route money .
<person> ' s <person> ?

you ' re on the verge , <person> -- please don ' t do this to me --
what the hell are you doin ' ?
i needed a place to hide . i ' m in trouble , <person> .
where did it go ? time traveller go ? nowhere in the usual sense . it ' s still here . but it ' s no longer in the present . it ' s traveling through time - to the future , to be precise . <continued_utterance> do you seriously expect us to believe that ?
certainly .
no . we neutralized enemies of the <person>ed states . anti-american radicals who have killed federal officers out here ! <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> . you think i don ' t like the indians ? not true . these were noble people but their day is gone . they ' re a conquered nation . they want all of america back but they can ' t even keep the garbage out of their own front yards . it ' s sad , <person> . but it ' s just the way it is . we have to function as a colonial police force out here .
you gentlemen ready -- hi , <person> .
how do they wear their hair ?
who ?
you want to stick around here , <person> ?
not in houston . wed be better off in some place more out of the way .

remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you ?
you ' re way ahead of me again ?
do you have a mirror ? it ' s the best way to see if someone ' s breathing .
he ' s dead , <person> . believe me , i know a dead dog when i see one . <person> looks miserably at poe .
youre just jealous of <person> cause hes sweet on me .

how long have you known him ? two weeks ?
you broke her heart ! you broke your mama ' s heart . you stole me ! that ' s right . fuck it away . but it ain ' t ever goin ' away , cause your mama -- she ' s like a hungry ghost baby , she won ' t go away , she won ' t leave ya alone .
no ! no ! please ! he hits her . <person> .

i ' m sorry . filby will you answer me one question honestly ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll try .
why this preoccupation with <person> ? time traveller why not ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t go simple on me , <person> ! time traveller if you want to know the truth , i don ' t much care for the time i was born into . - it seems people aren ' t dying fast enough these days . they call upon science to invent new , more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth . <continued_utterance> i quite agree with you . but here we are and we have to make the best of it .

have you ever thought that <person> doesn ' t want you to have a child ? that ' s why he fucking kills them before they ' re born . because you ' re fucking insane monsters that don ' t deserve a child .
<person> , we put a lot of love in our business .
we wanted you and <person> to have it someday . something real and honest .
regarding what ?

trust me , after a while you don ' t even miss them .
i take it things didn ' t much work out the way you planned .
i ' m still here , aren ' t i ? see this ? <continued_utterance> all this nothing ? it doesn ' t get to <person> like it gets to me . he says he don ' t mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond . more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
boys , time to get -- ahh ! <person> !

i hope i didn ' t disturb you .
i hope so , too , mr . <person> . can i get you something to drink ?

he didn ' t fix his test scores ; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class . it made him very popular . <continued_utterance> what started as school pranks eventually became something much more serious . after a year in the training program at goldman sachs , he decided that gambling suited him better than working for a living . that , in turn , involved him with some rather unsavory people and ultimately led him to put his financial genius to work in his true calling : money laundering . quinn is the swiss interpol liaison . he speaks with the crisp accent of a man who is fluent in several languages .
you ' ve assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer , mr . <person> .
so why is <person> shipping everyone out ?
<person> ' t you see ? ! from being a pile of red dirt with minerals , <person> is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate .
they organized this , not me . i have nothing to do with it .
well it ' s bad timing .
who are they ?
the leadership of our district . the diener . <person> is the one with no hair on top . they decided to come and see you for themselves . except <person> , of course . he came the first day . i think he saved your life .
hes so ugly . guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type .
<person> how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss , dont know how you can criticize .
i ' ve got the woman ' s name , sheriff . <person> . rachel <person> . that should simplify your work .
how about an address ?
so , where you off to now ?
<person> ' t you forgetting something ? your coupon . we got ta have it .

a jockey ? you mean , like --
horses , right . <person> something . <person> stops on his pad , looks up .
perhaps i ' m chocked full of inner demons ?

i ' ve got loads of time . <person> ' s not an issue . the parking lot thing kinda got me suspended . i need to keep working the smokers .
well we can definitely call the police . that ' s an easy call . if we call the police . what happens ? they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom . they ask us . what happened ? we say , ah . our friend , <person> . your brother . got a little out of control . they were making love . and he got a little excited . and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose .

stop .
<person> , use your head .
i am usin ' it , <person> . <person> ' how the hell we got in this tangle . you know they hit <person> ' s house , too ? shot up his wife . his wife . who ever heard of that ? men sneakin ' around in the dark , back-shootin ' , scarin ' women ? they ' re bugs , <person> . you know all your smart talk about <person> and let live ? ain ' t no live and let live with bugs .
<person> , if this is a dysfunctional --
no no , nothing like that . he keeps his appointments . pays on time . see him once . if he ' s not the most complex and -- persistent -- case you ' ve ever seen , drop him . his name ' s <person> . he needs someone brilliant .
i am not your brother . i never was .
<person> , this is madness .
yeah .
and his apartment -- there was some type of disturbance ? a fire ?
i haven ' t got it yet .
nice night .
<person> for instants .
you don ' t like <person> ? since when ?
i never said i wasn ' t upset . of course i ' m upset . i miss her terribly . but i know what i saw and what i heard . and it wasn ' t some `` symptom '' of something .
i never said .
periodistas ! take this picture ! i ' m going to blow his head off .
<person> ? he is a tyrant too , of course . a butcher . but finally that is not the point , you see . if we wish to survive -- we have a choice of tyrants , and for all the right reasons , your poets choose the wrong side .
they just said that to put us off guard . they saw the condition this apartment ' s in . <continued_utterance> they know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn ' t find it . so that means we ' ve still got it .
but he said the investigation was closed .
me ? what did i do ?
you know damn well , <person> . you ' ve been spreading rumors about <person> .
<person> advice for a shopkeeper . let alone a king .
your eminence , i ' m sorry that i was sharp with you . it ' s just that the musketeers . well , they ' re not just my guards . they ' re my friends too .
what now pork chop ?
look !
what ?
<person> is not dead . i just saw him .
you did ?
of course . but , d ' <person> , if this spy was to find out you are here , your life could be in grave danger .
they point , i shoot .
do you have a pen ? i just got promoted and don ' t have my new cards yet .
i ' ll look in the basket , if you don ' t mind .
be my guest .
extremely .
intelligent .
yeah .
i ' m not surprised you made the tournament , brendan . you got some stones .
that ' s a sad story . do you think you could ask <person> something for me ?
proceed .
and me .
. and <person> and <person> and <person> .
morning , beauty . <continued_utterance> let ' s go . or we ' ll never leave on time . from out of the pillow comes <person> ' s voice .
i ' m totally ready .
if you can ' t do the time , don ' t do the crime ?
oh . i almost forgot . there is one last thing : before <person> retired , he asked that i give you one other protective device .
<person> <person> will be on in a half minute . i like him . i never miss him .
ow ! ow ! ow !
why ? was i an arsonist in a previous life ?
no . but <person> was .
i want you to kill _for_me_ .
no . never . you ' ll have to kill me .
<person> , my daddy ' s still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that .
<person> , okay , just tell me what ' s the trouble .
oh , yeah .
all right .
and then you weren ' t there .
right . i ' m sorry .
got any plans ?
figure well go have supper someplace . maybe get some barbecue out by <person> . <person> always liked that <person> .
what do you mean ?
<person> , we are young , yes ? is the world not our oyster ? beaucoup des filles . do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl ?
it ' s <person> , <person> .
<person> ?
tell me one ?
she ' d aspirated vomitus into her mask .
well , i see you got all the wallboard up .
that was easy . you two did the hard part . sure sorry you ' re leaving .
i ' ve got some rights , too . you don ' t get those girls until after they ' ve done their number !
well , how long is it going to take ?
we ' re not cowboys . we can ' t , just wing it .
because i can ' t think straight most of the time .
god , the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones .
<person> , now , how far ' s your truck ?
that ' s right on my way .
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
he ' s a farmer ; i ' m a herdsman .
you ' re a suck , is what you are .
<person> , i swear i wasn ' t trying to trick you .
then what the fuck did you do it for ?
i don ' t want no dirty money . i run an honest business .
<person> , like <person> on tax day . get the keys ? darrell well , there ' s a $ <number> overnight storage charge we got to talk about . <continued_utterance> all i got ' s a hundred , <person> . you got change ?
not really . we had some friends in common , i guess . i didn ' t like him very much .
why not ?
just a place .
really , <person> , this aint right !
you said you wanted a dog .
a collie , though . not this one .
whats that ?
when he was about seventeen , he startin losin his hair .
vouching in evidence at wilshire station .
keep him on that . he had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and i trust him more than you . <person> . <person> everything on that effort and i want him apprehended <person> , not killed .
so what ? ! you want me to forgive you now ? is that it , <person> ? !
no . i just want you to give me another chance . that ' s all i ' m asking .
and i love you , too . but don ' t wear my stuff .
why do you do it , <person> ?
i told you before , <person> liked to be obvious .
<person> <number> . <number> isn ' t <person> .
andlt ; andlt ; it is longer than that . and not so dark . andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; are you sure ? andgt ; andgt ;
oh , alright . you know , i liked <person> desmond . he had his own m . o . <continued_utterance> i cracked the whiteman case with this .
<person> , i heard all about it .
it ' s the desert . that ' s what it is . the desert makes everybody crazy . <person> ' t that right , <person> ? people go crazy out here .
come on , <person> . i ' ve got to make tracks . that yogurt ' s got to make <person> before it spoils .
yes .
<person> ! its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head . right toward the bridge of the nose . lots and lots of irreparable damage .
what ' s fun about it ? ants get into the food . there ' s bees . i don ' t get it . we have to drive , it takes maybe an hour to get there , then you sit in grass and eat . why is that fun ?
i just thought it might be nice to do something together , that ' s all . thought it might be fun .
<person> .
i ' d love it . <continued_utterance> but i can ' t . i really want to but i can ' t . it ' s bird intestine and beef brain .
i know . pirates from sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships .
sometimes kill the crew ; other times - torture them .
' bout ten times .
hey , <person> , i think i know where your baseball is .
i wasn ' t the one drinking .
your blood alcohol level . maybe you were legally in the clear , but i make the rules here .
you got to relax , boss --
<person> ' to the u . s . open with the shanks . <person> na be chili dipping my way around the course on worldwide television . sure , relax .
so that ' s what this little drama is all about .
yeah . i think <person> plays the part of the sound mind , your wife the sound body .
<person> ! ! you shoulda seen me ! like i ' d been doin ' it all my life ! nobody would ever believe it .
you think you ' ve found your calling ?
yeah , right .
why not ?
<person> ' t you put this on me . <person> ' t do it , don ' t do it , don ' t do it , don ' t .
stop it . i ' m sorry .
i just wanted a little sip . <continued_utterance> probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night .
<person> . <person> , <person> , you appear to possess-like many an aspiring writer before you , by the way-a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made . however , i ' think it ' s best if , for the moment at least . we abstain .
the gold ; give it to me . <continued_utterance> give it to me !
if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
you must think i ' m blind and stupid . i ' ve already gotten the birds and bees from <person>by . the president doesn ' t have to double-barrel me .
<person> to me , goddamn it . we ' re talking about a possible nuclear war . you dropped the ball on bay of pigs --
did you study under <person> ?
among others .
i could never be with anyone who has a boat .
oh .
i never heard of it .
it ' s a hellhole . three motels and a mannequin factory . my dad worked there for thirty-five years .
tell me now .
call me back .
oh , yeah , i know where that is . all right . if the guy calls again , try to keep him on the line for at least a minute so we can trace the call .
but he never stays on that long ! sometimes he hangs up after just a couple of seconds .
we ' re on our way home . i just . we ' re running a little late .
how late ?
i tried to teach him right from wrong just like i did his <person> .
everyone has to follow his own plough . a man doesn ' t have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . city people don ' t give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . you don ' t plant old ways . . but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you . it ' s when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don ' t want it . you sell it to a stranger . you worked your whole life , for what ? i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm . all what we ' ve experienced has no meaning .
gordo the <person> , way to go .
<person> little company . i remember when we got the money for bluestar to build those first planes , back in the fifties .
is that really it ?
that ' s really it .
they ' re in a hurry to grow up . they don ' t know about consequences or responsibility . that ' s being sixteen too . i promise you one thing .
what ' s that ?
it ' s driving me crazy ! this thing keeps going around and around in my head .
and you know what , it ' s not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it . but let ' s face it , nobody comes out of our rib .
and <person> ' s going to own it all !
right ! he can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from earth . beach condos , ski resorts , you name it .
the precursor of science fact .
in some cases .
you still hanging in there with <person> ?
i ' m hanging in there like an interim post-war government waiting for the palace to be overrun . by younger men .
<person> told me that some judge made him move into that place . is that true or is he just making that up ?
no . that ' s true , pal .
<person> .
the agents who have worked out here say its like going into nam . <person> terrain , foreign language , foreign customs . and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds . they hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here .
there ' s an explanation for all this , <person> .
who the fuck are you ?
i can ' t , no , no , i can ' t .
tell me . please .
i ' m not leaving you .
<person> ' s walkie-talkie . it ' s probably upstairs . find it . call the ranger base . my gun . see if you can find our stuff . my gun ' s in my backpack , side pocket .
why is he worried ?
because , i don ' t know , because sometimes . sometimes i forget things . and ever since <person> left , ever since my daughter left for school , there ' ve been . i fainted and . why is this so hard ?
or really ? but that ' s very creative . <continued_utterance> but on second thought , i see what you mean . it makes me nervous . you think it must have come from one of our game players ?
it sure didn ' t come from me . the tone of it in the game was very , very passionate , fanatical . and the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming . the whole thing felt unstable , dangerous , volatile . but worse than that , there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot . <person> game-systems , jumping ship from one game company to another . that kind of thing .
and some really fast cars .
<person> ' t be such a pansy . all of this is yours .
<person> , <person> , it ' s sort of this adventure story , and <person> ' s father is this secret agent or something , working for the government . and it just made me feel weird . you know ? because i never really say much to him about <person> sr . , because i don ' t know what to say . and i don ' t know whether i should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine , or whether i should sit him down sometime and tell him , you know , that his father is not such a nice person . you know ?
well . i don ' t know , <person> . what have you told him already ?
why are you talking like that ?
listen to me carefully . first of all , <person> isn ' t here . dea ' s got him and they ' ll hang on to him until arraignment , which will probably be tomorrow . so here you ' re wasting your time . are you with me ? <continued_utterance> good . from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded , that the movement of your lips is being read .
<person> thinking maybe ?
someone send you to tell me all this ?
mind if we take a look inside ?
not until somebody gets a search warrant signed . it ' s sunday . i don ' t think they ' ve even found a judge , yet . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na have to call this in .
yes , i was .
<person> , were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew .
when he finds out .
what ?
ssshhh ! we say op . <person> operation . and this one got a little rough .
worse than <person> ?
no . he just keeps calling me . sometimes he doesn ' t say anything .
there ' s really nothing we can do about it down here . is the phone listed in your name ?
you lie .
no way , man . here , i got the page marked .
<person> , you heard him .
what if i ' m right , gloria ? what if i ' m right and <person> ' s wrong ? what do you do if you see a bad thing coming ? <continued_utterance> stick with me on this gloria . i need you .
sure .
he didn ' t give his name .
you know what we should do ? you and me should kill the biggest boar ever -- just huge ! -- and take it back to the village . just to show them . and we won ' t let anyone else eat it . they ' ll have to watch us eat it .
if it ' s that huge how would we carry it back ?
. and then , with a mighty bellow , i flew at the great metal beast and laid it low .
is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a --
as assistant secretary of the navy during the great war did you condone the use of .
i forgot one more thing you will need to write down . <person> circulation is a chronic problem for people in my condition .
you son of a bitch ! i ' ll have my lawyers shut you down .
you ain ' t got no credit card but you got a lawyer . <person> talk me all you want . <person> ' t you read the sign ? it says .
i mean ask for it . nicely .
i meant no disrespect .
it ' s a nightclub , not a drive-in , <person> . i don ' t follow the customers to the parking lot .
<person> , <person> . go on home . we might have to call you in for some more questioning .
what ?
do you love me ?
he ' s probably on drugs .
i know .
what about the chairs ?
okay .
the lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart , the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me . it all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast . <continued_utterance> did you mean it , <person>ie ?
how would you like it if i read your journal ?
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship .
<person> , why don ' t you get to the point where you get to the point .
you ' ve seen one naked breast , you ' ve seem them all .
<person> explains the continued success of `` heaven '' for how many decades ?
you ' re as battered and bloodied as he is .
and where ' s <person> ?
i , well , no , it ' s not that -- i just want you to be well-behaved . your rich daddy ' <person> ' doesn ' t care anything about you , and so somebody ' s got to train you , and one of the things you ' ve got ta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody ' s candy like a --
oh . <continued_utterance> oh .
crabtree .
ye-es ?
yes_
-- wow , she ' s really staring at you .
i didn ' t mean it that way .
you know you don ' t have to sneak . you could stay with me . i know things , <person> . sweet things . i could make you so happy .
but if .
but me no buts , honey . i told you : i ' ve hit a wall . and besides , it ' s not so bad here , if you just try to --
you still don ' t know shit .
i know what i wanted to know about <person> .
me and <person> had a meeting of the minds .
how ' s that ?
you ' re homesick .
lonely . is that the same thing ?
in a hurry , are we ?
i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit . it wouldn ' t really make a statement if i tiptoed out the door . what are you selling ?
<person> . i ' m sorry if things didn ' t work out so well for you tonight . with <person> .
forget it . i should ' ve known better . your friend is just , i don ' t know , into collecting weird tricks . <person> ? <person> angles the rearview mirror toward himself .
i know . all done .
not bad , nightingale . not bad at all .
that is very thoughtful of you . i haven ' t had time to tend to my garden like i should .
you know <person> and i are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother .
no -
the queen invited you to dinner -
that should give you some interesting ideas for your next book . you might even wake up feeling happy .
i doubt it . <person> , do you remember a classmate named <person> ?
<person> . <person> ? oh , mr . <person> . sure .
<person> ' t he tell you ? that ' s so like <person> . <person> dressed , we ' re going out .
so now you want to return the favor ? is that it ? !
i want that commission ! that should be mine !
<person> , <person> , i ' ve got places to be .
<person> --
of course you can . <continued_utterance> chief .
what are you doing here ?
including rape , pillage , murder .
sure , if that ' s what you want . why not ? it ' s all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
just give me the playpen .
need some help ?
we know , but our man says no way on the dope . this hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for turkey the next ' day . they had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
what was the money for ?
not no more .
what are you talking about ?
get out of our way , mr . secretary . the navy has been running blockades since the days of <person> .
i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission .
hi , <person> .
why don ' t you come in , have a drink ?
i was asking to do the new york- washington shuttle for a few months .
oh , and he said ' no , ' huh ?
hundred to one bb don ' t dance . a hundred to one against . <continued_utterance> i ' m getting out of the business , bb . i ' ve got nothing for all this .
lot of good times , <person> .
oh . <continued_utterance> this is , without a doubt , the stupidest , silliest , most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented .
yes , ma ' am , that ' s why i love it . and if you hit one good shot -- if that tuning fork rings in your loin -- you can ' t wait to get back . she cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night . it felt great and she knows it .
why don ' t you try a taste of this ?
<person> never tasted nuthin ' like that ?
i ' m not your boy . i don ' t like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . <person> ' s just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
<person> ' t say that . i had a marriage of convenience with <person> , and look where that ' s lead . well , looks like we got ourselves a contract . bobby do we shake hands ? <continued_utterance> if you can ' t trust the man you ' ve hired to kill your wife . ? the thing is it ' s got to look like an accident ; that ' s the thing . if it doesn ' t , then it ' s no good . i won ' t get a dime , and it ' s my neck that ' ll be on the chopping block while you ' re living it up somewhere .
later .
people can see .
mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt .
of course she did . i just wasn ' t listening . but you need to listen now ! i promised her , i made her a solemn promise , that you would be safe with me . with me , <person> ! ! <continued_utterance> they ' ll never make a head count . there are too many of us . you can stay here - slip underneath the bed - until they move out .
one more time . what is it you want ?
why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world . you chose protection ?
one time , <person> caught dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus ?
hell , peanut .
what ' s it at now ? still moving . <person> !
the man of the day . pour some water on him to cool him off . one of these days i want to know how you got <person> ' s account .

-what department ?
on a battlefield , defending his king . fighting bravely for france . and now . i will find the man who murdered my father and kill him where he stands .
a man is better measured by his life than by his death . your father was bold , and brave .
you think i fear death ? i welcome it . i get on my knees and pray for it . you , on the other hand , you have something to live for , no ? she ' s beautiful isn ' t she ? you should have seen her before . <person> , and still so innocent , not such a whore in bed .
you will never touch her . you will never get near her .
he wrote obscene words on the wall .
did you do it ? he didn ' t do it .
give me your arm lest you fall .
i could swear i heard my son call me .
it ' s a good thing you pay me well .
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --
there ' s no apology necessary .
how do i look ?
it ' s not bad .
<person> , <person> , about this afternoon . in
what do you want ?
come on . <person> ' s get a drink .
we can ' t just sit here waiting to die .
you come up with a better plan , let me know .
for you maybe .
<person> , i want you to know i blame myself for everything that happened .
no .
it ' s really safe .
have you ever even looked at `` heaven ? ''
what kind of sick question is that ? i ' ll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .
no .
what ' s wrong ? is it me ?
i ' m sorry mr . <person> --
<person> .
why ? what ' s his problem ?
he ' s a great chef .

we need this one big time , <person> , whattya think ?
looks straight to me .
<person> .
. is accusing me of rape . <person> told me . apparently i ' m the last to know .
but what if they find out . god , they ' d put you in the gas chamber .
so if they ' re tapping your phone , we ' re dead . stay in the guest house . skip the graduation parties . you ' ll never see <person> . <person> ? i love you .
you didn ' t have one .
but i did . he was a great man , a leader of the church . and his example inspired me to dedicate my life to <person> ' s service .
you heard me : anybody or any thing .
it ' s got no bullets , for <person> ' s sake .
what do you say we go get a suite at the carlyle ? <person> ? champagne ? celebrate , just like the old times <person> .
those days are over , <person> . they were over a long time ago .
well . her store was very close to our store , and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost --

minus specifics , it ' s hard to help .

`` . the battle for the airfield at abou deia is just another chapter in this endless story . from ndjamena , <person> , this is <person> . `` no -- you didn ' t hear any music -- must be the connection . <person> ? so long . <continued_utterance> <person> , don ' t play that <person> damn thing when i ' m filing . we ' re late .
it ' s my party -- we ' ll be late . you called it a `` strange war '' and an `` endless story . `` if you filed that story for me , i ' d say you were editorialishing .
is that a fact ?
sure as gravity . i ' ve had a feeling about you from the start , <person> . it ' s nausea .
<person> , why don ' t you have a gun with you ?
what ?
that ' s because i ' m really an arms dealer .
i ' ve never known an arms dealer .
we ' re going to tell them what we ' ve found . what we ' ve learned . <person> over a body infected with the gestating organism .
in hope of what ? learning that it ' s true ? ! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? !
okay . answers ! now !
they kidnapped me . said they ' d kill you if i didn ' t cooperate . i told them i didn ' t care , but then when i realized they meant it .
i hear nothing . not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart . i think that ' s the way it goes .
did you and <person> get engaged ?
<person> ? !
everything ' s ok . just some more preparations .
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school .
what else can you do ?
you know the transcript alone is enough to hang you .
<person> , well , we ' ll see what happens .
nice stroke .
is there some reason why you ' re here ?
all right . but let ' s keep the price down . i ' ve called <person> . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we ' re going to trial .

looking for something -- someone .
do you believe you ' ll see your mother again ?
be quick . <continued_utterance> oh , no .
<person> ! that a fuse ?
have you thought about what i said ?
<person> , can we not get into this now please ?
the line i get on this guy , is that he ' s done half the women in blue bay .
that doesn ' t make him a child rapist . there ' s something else . this girl ' s had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom ' s cars . <person> away .
where you headed ?
i don ' t know .
i know someone was there when i called . you had that tone . oh , no man , i ' ve got a cold . i ' m hanging in tonight .

<person> ' t anyone work ?
but that ' s not gon na happen with the attitude , it ' s not gon na happen with the lateness , it ' s not gon na happen by fighting me every step of the way -- ok , well not you , you ' re not late , but too much of that stuff goes on around here --
i am not late and i do not have an attitude -- well then don ' t tell me i ' m late if i ' m not late !

no , you ' re right , you ' re right --
what are you talking about ?
yeah , well , actually . i had a horrible dream .
you dreamed you ' d never see me again .
i ' ve heard that one before .
i ' m serious .
<person> somehow they knew i was getting close . <person> , it ' s narcotics . they make dope out of chemicals . they sell it on the street for millions of dollars . they ' ll do anything . and they can get away with it because they ' re cops .
i ' m afraid . i ' m afraid for <person> . i want to go home .
you mean she bit you ?
no , her dog !
do i know you ? i think i know you . <continued_utterance> long time , brother .
liking the place , frank .
whaddo we do ?
oh , i don ' t know , thelma . i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays . maybe we could have children with the prison guards .
-- to picket --
-- the big bad --
shanks are like a virus -- they just show up . nobody can figure ' em out .
<person> ! something ' s terribly wrong . what ' s your guess ? !

you gave him electric shock ?
yeah , we zapped him a few times . it ' s fairly standard .
what ' d he say about you having a job in d . c . ?
oh , <person> found me something in a real estate office , but .

it was his dream to go . i could hardly stand in the way of that , could i ?
<person> !
what ' d you bit me for ! !
i don ' t think so . the veins are cauterized - as if they were sealed by heat . but there are no burn marks on the flesh . it doesn ' t make sense . who found the body ?
dato . <person> fisherman . says it came in with the tide early this morning .
that ' s the first good thing i ' ve heard about him .
his address . no , no , no . he would never do anything that prosaic . on <person> , looking a little wounded . kathleen the only thing i really care about besides the married thing . and the jail thing . is the boat thing .

she likes old movies like i do , that ' s ail . besides , she doesn ' t really know me . she thinks she does , but she doesn ' t . maybe it ' s because she ' s <person> and i ' m catholic .
maybe it ' s because she ' s beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up , it ' s inevitable that it will in some way . <person> looks away from the window , at grady .
and she ' thinks ' she loves you .
it ' s past the thinking stage .
<person> up . <person> up . you ' re gon na have to step back and just calm down --

maybe you ' re not aware of this , <person> , but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods , psycholingusitics , dna fingerprinting ; i don ' t have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers . <person> was killed right here .
go back to the m . e . , take a look inside <person> ' s exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there . trust me , there ain ' t chickens in the badlands . his mother ' s place is --

it ' s not that i don ' t like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and . i just keep myself opening up . growning . and i want you keeping up with me here .
what does <person> have to do with your growing ?

they were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases . they also found this . i think we ignore the old ways at our peril , don ' t you ?
kelly , for christ ' s sake . <continued_utterance> the only way we ' re gon na blow this now , is if we do it ourselves .

i don ' t get it .
you wan na see my politics ? <continued_utterance> screw the world . if i ' m gon na die for something , it better be bitches and money .
that ' s what i ' m talking about , man ! that ' s why <person> <number> was born . <continued_utterance> to us it means no walls , no speed limits , no jails . it ' s everybody does what he wants . people think democracy is freedom but they don ' t have a clue . there ' s an old punk song . it says : `` america stands for freedom , but if you think you ' re free . ``
<person> , that thing . <person> ' t you .
rules are rules , mr . <person> .
you guessed right .
that ' s one girl who can ' t take a hint .
you ' re really twisted , <person> . you ' re incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there ' s a poverty that every last dollar in the world won ' t fill .
ooh ooh , tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package . does this mean you ' re ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own ? because , <person> , if you ' re through with me , you ' re through with everything i ' m a part of .
used to .

it ' s not true . right , <person> ?
well , funny story there . you see , uh , it started out as a uh . yeah . it ' s true . = <person> stands up .
it ' s not personal --
it ' s business .
if you don ' t tie up all the lose ends it ' ll never be over .
no .

<person> , i swear i wasn ' t trying to trick you .
you have changed since second grade .
i mean , what do you think ?
it has nothing to do with us . it ' s big , impersonal , overstocked and full of ignorant salespeople .
but they discount .

he ' s trying to put it behind him , <person> . you should too . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got a beautiful life . and even with this , it ' s always been clear that he loves you . i ' ve come to think that ' s all that really matters .
i don ' t know .
really .
<person> is it ?
<person> !
what ?
we just have to get him through <person> . <person> tight . <person> ' t let the bed bugs bite .
bed bugs !
well . money ' s tight and .

my son <person> . it ' s a gift for him .
how old is <person> ?
you haven ' t even looked at them once .
they look nice .
i got it . wow . did somebody bite you ?
what do you mean ?
was he carrying anything ? <continued_utterance> search him . <continued_utterance> do i have to do everything around here ?
i hope so . <continued_utterance> i hope you ' ll be gentle .
he just leeches off your parents . he is a master at wearing out welcome .
<person> is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock .
it ' s you they ' re after , madmarti- gan . what did you do this time ?
they ' re not after me . they want the baby .
i knew it . i knew you were a musketeer the moment i saw you .
you did ?
wrong .
you ' d lie to protect him .
then can ' t we just talk ?
i don ' t see patients on vacation , <person> . ever . how many ways can i make that clear ?
but i ' m really not here to try to get you to do anything , or to believe anything . and i ' ll tell you the same thing i told her , which is that as far as i ' m concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you , by the way she lives her life . <continued_utterance> and that doesn ' t mean she ' s supposed to be a saint , either , if that ' s what you ' re smiling about .
i didn ' t realize i was smiling .
hey , <person> . pass up the bubbly and my gloves , will you ? <continued_utterance> not until you see it !

come on , <person> . <person> ' t screw up . you have some real talent .
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn ' t mean you ' re even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago .
<person> .
it ' s a fortune box .
oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we ' ll oil him up .
-- a hot water bottle would be good if we had one .
all that changed .
why ?
you mean care what you say ? i ' m worrying about other things .

i think she has to find out for herself , on her own . we have to allow her space --
i ' m not worried ?

<person> , fred , you can ' t give away all those .
they want an update .
tell them he ' s eating eggs .
that ' s fine for you . but do i go back and say i interviewed <person> ? do i go back and say i missed the biggest story of the war ? or do i say <person> was stone cold dead -- that ' s the information , isn ' t it ? or do i say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol ' revolutionary campfire ? can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was . sympathetic ? journalists don ' t fall in love . which story do you want me to tell ?
do what you want to do .
everything ' s being done but it ' s not enough . i have to find something -- more .
<person> , honey . there ' s nothing more .
i don ' t think so .
why is this kid staring at me ?
i don ' t want to stay here .
they are english . they don ' t understand .
it ' s not okay . it ' s extortion .
what did you tell him ?
oh , come on , <person> . that ' s a little dramatic .
think so ? you know what chickens do if one chicken ' s born with a little difference ? with a few black feathers on its head , say ? they peck at the black spot ' til the chicken ' s dead -- they can ' t stand the fact that it ' s different . now we ' re both different . your difference is something other than . . my difference . but we ' re both aliens here .
nice , eh ?
she dead ?
um . yes .
i ' ve seen you . from the window .
<person> , mrs . <person> .
for instance , if a child is having trouble getting to sleep , what would you do ?
are you sure ? . about me , i mean ?
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you ' re what i want . the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about <person> . but i ' ve had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we ' ve got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish .
i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy .
were you with <person> ? or are you two still fighting ?
no , and yes . i don ' t know what i ' m going to do about <person> . i know he is seeing someone else and that ' s okay with me , and he thinks i ' m seeing someone else and that ' s not okay with him .
then leave him here . where he is .
ok . i will . if that ' s what you want . but i have to be honest , i ' m not sure that ' s what <person> wants .
you win .
i ' m <continued_utterance> you really think it could ' ve dropped off an airliner ?
you go first .
all right . this morning --
we do appreciate your honesty , <person> . and believe me , we understand your extreme situation , but . <person> ' s going to have to be handed down .
<person> , it ' s <person> at base , come back .
<person> . !
what ?
no ! the gods demand a sacrifice ! and you ruined it !
why don ' t we just sacrifice something small -- a rabbit maybe . or a duck . that ' d be good , don ' t you think ?
you got some kind of business with him ?
i ' m looking for him .
one second , <person> .
you ' re not getting any penetration , even with the elephant gun .
they cut off your testicles .
what ? ! what ' s up with all the genital mutilation ?
it doesn ' t sound like defense to me .
i wanted to humiliate the guy . here i am , out busting my ass all day making a decent living , i come home , and some schmuck is trying to steal from me .
is that what you think ? you have friends ? is that what they told you ?
i don ' t mean who you ' re thinking . i have other friends .
yes , i love you . i ' ve told you , but it doesn ' t really matter .
why ? it does .
no , no . in fact , you would be useless to us without them . we realists are forbidden to have them , and so we have to use people like you on occasion .
i don ' t understand . are you wanting us to jack a game into our bioports ?
no , no . the arms shipment has been delayed in new orleans because <person> is getting nervous .
the state department ' s gon na pull the plug on <person> ? ! <person> my french -- but whose fucking side are you on ?
<person> ' t go that far .
<person> . <continued_utterance> what ' s gotten into you ? <continued_utterance> ow !
well , little fella , let me put it this way . the operative word here would be `` federal '' . with or without the semantics of all this , i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning <person> , both while living and deceased .
a basic kill . <person> was a drifter and nobody knew her . my boys have been all over this . it ' s a dead end .
okay now , what ' s the big deal ?
stand still . i want you to remember this in the morning .
i ' m sorry . i was afraid something like this could happen .
<person> about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people .
who ' s in charge here ?
i am . what do you want ?
interesting .
what ' s the best way to qualify a mark ?
yeah .
this kid is good . so just . you know . be ready out there .
that ' s great , <person> . and i ' m learning how to listen to the tuning fork , throw caution to the wind , and take crazy risks i never thought were possible .
c ' mon , <person> , when did you ever take a crazy risk ?
you and the carter boy . want to catch me up on recent developments ?
you ' re asking if we ' re involved ?
absolutely !
and give her a bath everyday , and don ' t let her get cold . and keep her diaper changed .
yes . i am .
then why don ' t you run off with him ? what are you waiting for ?
still partial to camels , huh ?
first pack of tailor-mades i had in a while . <continued_utterance> you must be my son .
let ' s see , it closed at uh , <number> <continued_utterance> rising profits . strong balance sheets , good earnings per share .
so you ' re hot on this stock ?
not yet . by now , he ' s stashed <person> , so he ' s travelling solo .
who ' s this `<person> ' clown anyway ?
we ' ve got to keep moving while there ' s still light .
you know what i ' m going to do ? i ' m just going to take a second . i want to look at the gold .
who is that horrible friend of yours ?
madmartigan .
you don ' t think i can knock it on from there ?
it seemed like a low-percentage shot .
i know i made things worse . i know that and i ' m sorry , but <person> i need something from you . something only you can help me with .
<person> --
and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight .
you wont of missed much .
hey , brendan . it ' s me , <person> .
what ' re you doing here ?
we ' re supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats , now they ' re telling me that there was a mistake and we can ' t have padded .
what kind of seats can we have ?
of course . of course ! where ? can ' t i bring it to you ? for god ' s sake , baby , please , just tell me what ' s happened , what could possibly be so bad ?
<person> ? <continued_utterance> do you love me ?
come in , <person> , <person> .
<person> ? that you , <person> ?
she ' s really a fox , isn ' t she ?
did you pork her <person> ?
i don ' t care . cancel it .
no way . <continued_utterance> i ' m not calling and cancelling on daly . you call and cancel on daly .
did he say where he was going ?
i think he said he was going to <person> ' s room .
what ' s not to like ?
i ' d have been bored here on my own . there ' s more than enough room for two .
just us .
<person> , what are you going to need to clean it up
smart , too -- he can talk .
sure -- i just about believe you .
oh , mom .
you ' re the only thing i care about . always will be .
hey , wes , what kind of treasure you figure these people buried ?
if ! if there ' s a treasure .
i don ' t know ! this is crazy ! i can ' t be having this conversation .
you ' re having it .
we . we could go home with something else .
what ?
you did it again . <continued_utterance> i put you out of business . you ' re entitled to hate me .
i don ' t hate you --
but with you , she gets to be hot , right ?
red hot . her thighs steam .
in my back yard . i lied before . it ' s hardly started . but when it ' s done , it will have twice the power of this one --
<person> , back up . you lied ?
that wasn ' t him . i heard him tell the cops .
no -- <person> -- that was him . but that was him . i wish it wasn ' t , but it was .
but you ' re crazy about him --
yes . i am .
i already am .
promise you ' ll look in my eyes the whole time .
better go with ' em , honey . here ' s where i leave you .
no , stay . please stay with me .
right . <continued_utterance> we , better skedaddle . close that closet -- <person> ? you ail right ?
i ' m sorry . professor tripp . maybe it ' s seeing that jacket that belonged to her . it just looks . really lonely . hanging there . in a closet . maybe i ' m just a little sad .
<person> . you keep calling me <person> . you did it just now . you did before , just after i woke up . you called me <person> . nobody calls me <person> .
i ' m sure you ' re mistaken . you musta told me before .
i told you , darling . <person> harbors you no ill will . i will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter .
<person> well , but i don ' t see how i am to live with him . my mother values my indentured servitude .
you know what i ' ve got at stake with this paper . you know that . i can ' t help but think that you ' re doing this now to hurt me , or to sabotage me somehow .
<person> ?
<person> ' s hope so .
looks like we ' re in for a long , uncomfortable trip .
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anesthetic . the type you gave her . would have been negligent . ?
negligent . yes . it would have been criminal . but that was not the case .
they ' re glass . the buttons .
like the lady herself .
yeah .
ah --
not really . least not so i recall now .
so howd he finally nail you ? right there in the kitchen ?
your cable said you wouldn ' t be putting out until mid-october .
as you can see , there ' s a lot to do .
how the hell are we gon na get outta here ?
we ' ll think of something .
we are a stunning couple . mr . president , you own one fifth of all the land in nicaragua , you own the shipping port , the national airlines , the mercedes dealership .
i am on a salt free diet .
i was hoping that was just one crazy guy .
did you hear the way he screamed at me ? he wasn ' t alone .
she ' s a tough kid that one . she tell you bad things about me ?
yeah . but i never believe her anyway .
with what ?
you know damn well , dead-man .
you know what i think ? you ' re either a very good actress or you really do sort of like me .
i am an actress .
who knows ? why does anyone get married ?
love .
yeah , they ' re bad for your health . i ' m tryin ' to look out for you .
that ' s cop bullshit .
and give me a vodka tonic with a twist --
molly , really , this isn ' t .
<person> . <continued_utterance> i was hoping you came to the door instead of him . it gets cold at night .
this doesn ' t make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air .
i . nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . <person> like hell .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . <person> ' ll think maybe me and <person> went away . buy us some time . i know a back road we can take .
well , now he saw me . now you saw me . ok ? now would you mind ?
man , you are really --
excuse me , but who is that ?
oh . that ' s my dad . <continued_utterance> he can ' t talk . had a major stroke a few years back . but he ' s doing well . <person> ' t ya <person> ?
any minute now .
it ' s show time . <person> ' t look at the flash . do not look at the flash .
<person> , <person> <number> . you ready for this ? leo wasn ' t killed in the badlands . i . i found the location .
<person>isy <person> place ?
if we see a thief or a pickpocket , we just slap him around -- maybe cut off a finger or an ear , or the tip of his nose , lower lip -- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion -- then we take our share of the loot and let him go . mostly what we worry about are activist types , rabble rousers , getting people all riled up against the king or the temple priests .
pretty harsh , isn ' t it ?
. then it wouldn ' t be stalkerish .
i know !
it ' s a waste . an awful waste .
what ' s the acreage here ?
<person> to explain . very hard .
well , try .
then dump it . give her poplar . it sucks but you ' ve got your practice to worry about , right ?
yeah , i do .
thanks .
sure .
and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive .
stop .
i am , the night ' s still young ! . it ' s gon na be a lively one . i ' m gon na make us a little snack .
so , who is it anyway -- <person> or <person> ?
well , i figure if you take a state policeman , shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk , it ' s best to just get on out of the state if you can .
just asking .
that ' s none of your goddamn business ! so keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut ! <person> , they like <person> .
oh sure , <person> .
he does know how to delegate doesn ' t he . and also i ' m sure that poor negro ' s nosedive has put you squarely in his debt .
something like that .
then you can ' t have that commission .
we ' ll see about that .
because , i don ' t know , because sometimes . sometimes i forget things . and ever since <person> left , ever since my daughter left for school , there ' ve been . i fainted and . why is this so hard ?
fireball ?
i ' m <person> . the handsome , devoted best friend . we ' re so close , we feel each other ' s pain . <continued_utterance> see what you do to me , baby .
oh my , he would have been so proud . you ' re the spitting image of him .
why ?
i stole a car .
i ' m getting in that room , <person> .
i can ' t let you in there .
how was your house after the party ?
what party ? a party ?
it wasn ' t the gold . it was the claymore mine . the gold ' s in my pack .
when did you make the switch ?
i think they forgot about you . <continued_utterance> what happened to you , anyway ?
somebody tried to kill me .
i outrank you <person> ! are you out of your mind ?
you fingered <person> for his father ' s disappearance and pressed me to do the same to cover your ass !
<person> sends his regrets but he had to take a trip .
what kind of trip ? i thought you were working with him .
count de winter .
we found you .
<person> , listen to me . i know you ' re under some strain . but there ' s no such thing as ghosts . they don ' t exist . our neighbor did not kill his wife , and i . wait , why aren ' t you dressed ?
dressed ?
<person> ' t there something called group hysteria ?
you think you influenced her ?
the hell i did !
the hell you didn ' t !
. and everyone lived happily ever after .
sort of .
<person> , sweetheart . <person> in love with you like i am brings out that ugly jealous side .
well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gon na get that <person> back here and away from that murderer .
. as usual , i see the situation is in <number> ' s very capable hands .
<person> is not fair .
<person> , i ' ve told you about twenty times , yes , i could identify ' em , but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this .
well , you ' re not exactly an expert witness , but what makes you so sure ?
what ?
i doctored my grades so i ' d make the cut . i ' m a moron , okay ? you satisfied ? !
what was ?
the stuff we got last night .
i am not here , ol ' buddy . the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship , the missing gold , where it was going , or when it left hong kong .
that ' s reassuring .
childs , where ' s that magneto from chopper one ?
ain ' t it there ?
i knew youd want it again .
thats not why i called .
<person> --
ok . <person> . could you just take a look at my radiator hose . it ' s busted . <continued_utterance> so ?
oh-oh- cu - <person> crying - speaks -
it ' s only a man without a head who could do a thing like that . <person> little bee . cu - dorothy reacts - reaches o . s . -
what are we going to do about it ? you got a flash ?
a glimmer .
hub kittle . i ' m with <person> and <person> -- new york . we have a client down here .
who ?
what ' s it like ? imagine you ' re being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta , except the beggars are wearing $ <number> suits and they don ' t say `` please '' or `` thank you . ``
what about legalizing everything ?
lance and i are walking down to the movie theater . there ' s tv dinners in the freezer . oh , and <person> - your father got a job in ukiah .
<person> ? do you think it might be a good idea if i moved in with him ?
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they can ' t see . i can ' t see nuthin ' , so it ' s all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it ' s all the same to me .
so , we ' re all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
i will , <person> . <person> .
<person> , what ' s a daikini ?
whattaya mean family ?
well . i mean like <person> bein in a family way .
did you come to offer me consolation ?
no .
<person> ' s mother ' s called three times this morning . said she hasn ' t heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn ' t show up for work yesterday or today .
she sure this was the park they were coming to ?
well , listen , mrs . <person> , umm .
<person> , mrs . <person> .
you know , <person> , we hardly ever do things together .
like what ?
i don ' t understand what you ' re saying . i saw <person> get shot , i swear to you .
then why didn ' t you help him ?
we got ta do something !
<person> , what ' re you gon na do with that gun ?
well , you and your husband are special . ya , <person> tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor . <continued_utterance> how many people do you all feed ?
last saturday we handed out over two hundred meals .
are you about to compliment , my phone voice ?
it ' s pretty good , you know -
i called him a sissy .
well , he sure ' s hell can ' t sue you for slander . that boy fights for the pink team . did you make him cry ?
i appreciate your time -
maybe you should talk to <person> . owns a marine salvage company . nobody knows more about the strait .
they need it to be simple . they need a reason .
who ?
no .
<person> , why did you do this ? please just tell us . <person> needs to be in a home .
spy is such an odd word , mr . price . nobody is a . ' spy ' . anymore .
russell prefers pictures to words .
i mean really ! that business with your tongue . what is that ? that ' s disgusting !
and , oh my god , that other thing , that pointing to your lap ? what ' s that supposed to mean exactly ? does that mean pull over , i want to show you what a big fat slob i am or .
everywhere i go , it ' s always the same . there ' s always some kid who thinks he ' s hot with a sword . some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great porthos .
the great who ?
war horse .
yeah . war horse . and there he is . what a strange beast you ' ve become .
i ' ve got no stomach for murder .
it ' s a combat action .
you know , considering you ' ve only been out of prison for seven hours , you ' re readapting quite well . <person> , i didn ' t mean that the way it sounded . i meant .
<person> ' t worry about it , all right ?
i promise you , i won ' t walk out of the door . <continued_utterance> <person> ! please don ' t think me un- friendly ! - come over to dinner - next friday . <person> ' t you ?
very well .
what ' s he saying ?
his bag . you know that ratty green thing he ' s always carrying around . he must ' ve left it inside .
he told you it was about eggs ? the guy tried to break into my house . he tried to steal things from me .
he was trying to find me . we had an argument .
congratulations on your survival . your life is worthless now , i hope you know that .
and yours ?
oh , but it ' s not . if i hadn ' t been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , i never would have took off for new york . i never would have met <person> , see . that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything .
can we just get back to <person> ?
that ' s not entirely true .
oh , right . you ' re probably not a virgin anymore . but as far as being a hack , that much is status quo .
no , i mean the suitcases . we can ' t bury them in suitcases .
why ?
uh . we ' re between congregations at the moment .
well . i should get back to work . <person> ' ll be down soon and that path ain ' t gettin ' clear on its own .
well , just to ask her advice .

i don ' t know .
i did what you told me , <person> . i threw my backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide . i even left a note .
<person> , <person> , i ' m kinda impressed . faking your suicide is pretty ballsy .

i don ' t know . he just fired me .
i think i have to meet this <person> .
that right ?
<person> ' t play babe in the woods with me . i know that guy from the gym came to see you .
if nourish isn ' t our real contact , who is he ?
nourish is a double agent for cortical systematics . he was working with <person> to subvert the realist cause , and doing it rather well . <continued_utterance> after all , he got you to assassinate your own contact . but now you ' re going to put a stop to him .
to get my life back . to have some time for myself . some time for us .
you did a great job . she ' s a good kid .
<person> . baby . <person> , calm down now , honey . please don ' t get so mad . i can explain .
<person> on . <person> on a minute , damnit .
<person> . what .
<person> . <person> ' t get all melancholy over the thirty seconds you were single a long time ago .
i see the good doctor gave you glowing testimonials . ' exceptional stamina ' .
he ' s always been good at oral exams .
<number> years .
my god . have you had to . have sex with other women in the line of duty ?
i can , <person> . i debated whether or not to even tell you in person , because i knew --
we ' re close to something here -- we ' re on the verge --
oh shit ! <continued_utterance> you <person> ?
nope . <person> .
how ' s it goin ' , <person> ?
not bad . i just won the state lottery .
why are you telling me this ?
i thought it only fair you should know , given how hard you ' ve worked .
i don ' t know ! i just want to get married .
say it again .
he says it ' s a box .
<person> , you ' re funny .
you all right ?
things could be better .
no , she ' ll be back in a couple of hours -- around midnight , she said .
oh .
great heavens , man , don ' t you know we ' ve been at war with germany since nineteen fourteen ? i thought perhaps you had seen action in france . or maybe . perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better . <person> ' t you come in ?
no . no , thank you .
i mean i took him to play pool ! it was a little clandestine thing we did for fun ! it wasn ' t like a big secret , i mean who cares ? i was actually trying to be nice to him . but he ' s so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin ' squeal on me and i have to listen to your fuckin ' shit all day when i didn ' t even fuckin ' do anything !
first of all , he didn ' t tell me anything : <person> did . ok ? second of all , i don ' t really give a shit if you took him to play pool : i was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain . but no , i don ' t want you telling him not to squeal , because i don ' t want him put in that position !
well , sure . but he was super-gentle , you know ? i mean , he raped me and all , but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes . i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started , it didn't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick , and after <person> just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich .
and you never told nobody about it ?
<person> ' t worry <person> . <person> and i had a little talk . we came to an understanding . i want you to go back to him . soothe him . help keep his head straight . <person> ?
i can ' t . and i won ' t .
<person> , awright .
i got the golden tassel to sponsor you at the open .
<person> ?
ever since the accident i ' ve been worried that you ' d been unhappy , or .
i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up .
<person> , well , like my <person> used to say . you can ' t change your christmas past , but you sure can exchange your christmas presents .

i gather you ' re a decorator .
get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
of course . i ' ll do what i can . i have to go , before they notice .

that ' s okay , <person> - <continued_utterance> what is he doing here ?
well . to be honest . i ' m really crazy about you and it ' s making me nervous and when i get nervous i ' m not myself and i ' m afraid i ' m going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure .
that ' s really sweet , ted , but you should save it for one of your books .
what ?
the west end . we buy it off the streets . i can stop , you know , and she can ' t . two people , really similar , we can talk about anything , but for me it ' s like a weekend thing , then i get my shit together , and for her it ' s different --

i ' m ready to charge forth in pursuit of my mythic destiny and i can ' t get time off work to do it .
i ' m no expert , but it seems to me that the `pursuit of a person ' s mythic destiny ' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do .

ya , but you can ' t do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i ' m not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .

if the sock fits , wear it .
it started out for <person> .
<person> , i can imagine .

you actually got around to killing someone . i ' m impressed . i guess you ' re only half a bitch .
wes , we thought you were dead , and we thought we were next . hanging around to get killed wouldn ' t have done anyone any good .
<person> ' t you like him ?
oh , c ' mon -- i love him ! only , i ' d like to see you alone for once , that ' s all .
they are following you <person> . <continued_utterance> they think you ' ll lead them to me . but if you follow my instructions closely , there is a way for us to get away . <person> scans the rest of the letter .
<person> ! je vous en prie --
<person> ? you want to be in `` heaven ? ''
i turned eighteen over spring break . i ' m eligible .
because you ' re an alien . you don ' t belong in concrete any more than i do . this place would like to kill us because we ' re different .
oh , come on , <person> . that ' s a little dramatic .
he ' s not slowing .
he ' s going to slow down .
what did you think of <person> ' s column this morning ?
i think it ' s a bad idea .
<person> ' t worry , <person> , i ' ll figure something out .
i ' m not worried . you ' re not worried , are you . professor tripp ?
everything okay ?
yes , thank you very much .
he phoned it in .
i see .
i ' m aware of that .
so what ' s it doing in tijuana ? <continued_utterance> let me ask you a hypothetical question : if <person> worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel , and he went out of power , would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ?
i feel exactly the same way about you .
oh , <person> , don ' t say that , please , that just makes it worse .
i ' m sorry to do this early . i got ta be done by <number> .
you ' re not going to make the <number> : <number> , are you ?
look , tomorrow morning is very important and i ' d like to call it a night . i don ' t want to be rude but i think it ' s time for <person> to sing his way home .
<person> , you don ' t expect <person> to walk back in this do you ?
attack of the atomic vampires .
we can ' t all be <person> .
full on . seventy miles an hour . <continued_utterance> one hundred and six miles from the terminal .
it ' ll reach the other end in seventy- eight minutes . any more of these rigs ?
it ' s them , <person> . now , <person> , listen to me and listen to me carefully . <person> to me as you never listened before .
are they going to kill you ?
does he have a gun ?
no .
it ' s all i ' m good for -- but you can count on me for that , at least .
how far off the back foot ?
what is wrong with us ? . we have everything .
everything , but everything .
be a sport . how bad could spring break in los angeles be ?
i guess we could go to disneyland or something .
then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home , you get rid of the gun . <continued_utterance> please . <continued_utterance> was that all of them ?
yes .
what are you doing ?
just watch . <continued_utterance> inhale the smoke and hold it .
i said put it all on <person> . got it ?
we can ' t let you --
oh , come on , <person> . psycho killers , bears . snakes ! i just don ' t know how to use it . so will you take care of it ? <continued_utterance> whose place is this again ?
it ' s <person> ' s , the day manager ' s . he ' s gettin ' a divorce , so his wife ' s gettin ' this place , so he ' s just lettin ' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys .
he ' s got a lot to be proud of .
<person> and <person> don ' t get along .
i just thought it might be nice to do something together , that ' s all . thought it might be fun .
it doesn ' t sound like fun to me . you take the stuff you ' ve got here in the house , you take it someplace to eat it . it ' s just as much fun eating in front of the tv , and we do that together , don ' t we ? no ants and no bees . much more comfortable .
no . we got in a fight because he ' s an asshole .
really ?
in exchange for what ?
my driving range back .
where exactly ?
you sure you ' re not trying to keep me here ? <continued_utterance> why wouldn ' t i ?
for what ?
well , i counseled you , you did exactly what i said , and i just . poured cold water over your effort . i didn ' t get it . i ' m a terrible shrink , probably . i should ' ve never got out of real estate -- actually i should never have left <person> for that cowboy in armarillo -- have you ever been to amarillo ?
no ! he was crazy . i didn ' t-he looked -- <number> thought --
<person> , okay . take it easy . <person> ' t freak out on me .
newcomers , eh ? names <person> , i ' m <person> . <person> town ?
just this minute . i ' m <person> , these ' re my brothers-
i ' ve already contacted our station in <person> . they ' re lining up a local contact . i want you to find that gold , and secure it .
. <person> ' t <person> just move his headquarters to <person> ?
what ' s her name ?
<person> .
me neither . i ' m terrified to look under the plates . <continued_utterance> this `` support for the fanatics '' thing doesn ' t sound too good .
we can ' t stop . i ' ve been noticing some new . glitches . i ' m not sure what they mean . i ' m not sure the game is ok .
it sure does .
how much ?
i don ' t want to wait for you again . we ' ve been circling each other since the montreal olympics .
you ' re a genius of bad timing . i ' m going back to the party . <continued_utterance> this is a great shot .
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
what if it never happens ? what if
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
laundromats for the washing of money . unfortunately , <person> had only one successful business .

<person> ' t you want to know . ? i bet it ' s burning a hole in your brain just now ?
what kind of dancer ? .
whatever kind they wanted her to be . <continued_utterance> i ' m telling you what i was told by my uncle . and he should know . he ran half a dozen men ' s clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt .
hey , belinda . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> .
from citizen high to citizen low .
what are you talkin ' about ?
go .
i just want to let you know mr . <person> i read all about you at nyu business , and i think you ' re an incredible genius and i ' ve always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you .
so what firm you with , pal ?
i hope you don ' t mind my asking , but are you <person> ?
yes .
why ?
why what ?
you and i are the same , <person> . we ' re smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love . a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
you ' re really twisted , <person> . you ' re incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there ' s a poverty that every last dollar in the world won ' t fill .
<person> , i got to get some sleep .
<person> told me about that thing at cao ben ?
is that what youandiacute ; re looking for ?
a piece . only a piece .
that looks scrumptious . <continued_utterance> did i do something ?
no , <person> . it ' s fine . eat up . <person> . <person> looks at <person> and shakes her head `` no '' .
how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! i didn ' t have to sleep with you to find that out .

but then you ' ve been so much better .
oh , god . i hope i ' m not too late .
it ' s just the first wave . you can be part of the second wave . ok , <person> . put your arms up . i have to scan you . metal and heavy synthetics can ' t come in .
you ' re leaving it out . finish your swing . you ' re going to like this one -- she ' s half asian , half american .

sure . but your fee . considering you ' re way over budget , should be negotiable .
yes . and the old guys we chased-
no .
i ' ll stay .
we ' ll leave him a note . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m not defending <person> ' s recent behavior in any way , so please don ' t take this personally . however irrational the reasons , <person> is so upset with you that i think it would be best if you weren ' t around when he comes back .
it looks like you ' re not doing anything .

'' they all hollered back , `` sinning . `` the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said , `` please to meet you . `` he asked , `` i thought you ' ll was supposed to be burning in fire . `` <person> said , `` man , ain ' t no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins . `` the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth .

the `` real '' stuff ? . you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies ?
no , c ' mon !
oh yeah ? i left the country because of him . . and i came back because of him . and now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse ' s ass on a midnight tour of managua . what are we doing here ?
<person> is dead . <person> . <person> isn ' t quite sure he understood .
think you can do it ?
not from in here .
how ' s your cold ?
still there . how ' s yours ?
hey , watch your mouth -- she ' s a great gal . i ' m the dumbshit for lying to her .
why didn ' t you just tell her the truth ?
i could -
say no more , i ' m right behind you . <continued_utterance> and you understand what ' s happening , do you not , <person> ? that you must lay so very nice and still . there ' s a lad , you ' re a remarkable horse , you are , helping us help you . there ' s a lad . there ' s a remarkable lad . <continued_utterance> so how ' s things in yonder trench ?
would you like a drink ?
i ' d like an apartment .
<person> . i ' m marked for death and they send me on the road with a pr nerd .
<person> ! <person> for death !
<person> would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn ' t have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .
what do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
i ' m very impressed with you keeping it up .
i don ' t like it .
he is my sponsor . the general is the head of the secret police of <person> .
mr . <person> is one of his operatives .
oh , i don ' t know . i ' m just nervous . i got ta figure out what to do .
well , when you figure it out , wake me up .
a friend . of <person> .
yes .
brian , i think you ' re going crazy .
i know i am . can you meet me ?
you agree with a lot of what he says , don ' t you .
i know where he ' s coming from . the only thing i really don ' t get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
me ?
`` local boy inherits more money than god . `` call me crazy , but i smell human interest .
<person> , whoa , whoa .
- how did you get all this stuff , this apartment , this life - <continued_utterance> i see .
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case ?
i ' m not a stalker ! she ' s a friend of mine .
tell me . bring it on .
it ' s sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection . it ' s a facial prosthetic . it was two weeks in the making .
magnificent , isn ' t it ?
yes . hi , i ' m <person> . i thought i knew most of <person> ' s friends but i don ' t believe i know you .
you must influence her to send you away . i feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part .
what do you want me to do ?
then we both know . i ' ll point . you drive . <person> .
we ' re following fire trucks ?
<person> , give me your money .
<person> . <person> .
do you know what this is worth ? <continued_utterance> what i was thinking as i was trailing him was that eventually i would have the courage to say hello to him , you know , not in a horrible , intrusive or slavering fan-slash-acolyte kind of way , but more like , `` hi . `` `` how ya doing ? '' `` have you ever thought about trading up in the sock area ? '' `` who knows , maybe he ' s read my work -- and then we ' d become friends , and eventually i ' d introduce him to you -- you know how much he loves children ' s books , there ' s a whole long section in relativity ' s <person> about the wizard of oz -- and then maybe he ' d come out of hiding so he could help save the store .
what are you talking about ?
all she knows is she likes the three dog ' cause his name is pride of odessa ' cause she ' s from odessa .
<person> ready for oddessa-lation , boys .
is he a fraud ?
how would you ever know ?
how come bioports don ' t get infected ? i mean , they open right into your body .
<person> to what you ' re saying , <person> . <person> ' t be ludicrous .
what ' s this , an interview ? i ain ' t that dumb .
off the record .
<person> . <person> secret .
sure . set me up and then don ' t tell me .
you what ?
you heard me , goddamnit . i . i love her . healy slowly lets go . tucker i ' m a phony -- just like you , man .
silence !
ohhh -- jiminy crickets ! els -- throne --
well , don ' t say i didn ' t warn you when things go your way .
you got a lotta philosophy in you , old timer but you don ' t fool me for one second with all this blind man crap . one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam , next it ' s the joint . now it ' s a woman ? i ' m hep to you .
i was her doctor .
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy .
you think you influenced her ?
maybe . i don ' t know . i just know that when all this was happening , i felt , some part of me felt . alive . <person> somebody needed me . and the more i reached out to , it , the fuller it became .
how ' s your book coming ?
there ' s a children ' s book editor i know , from the store , and she ' s excited to read it . when i finish it . who would ever have thought i ' d write ? i mean , if i didn ' t have all this free time , i would never have discovered -- she stops , realizing what she ' s saying . kathleen the truth is , he was the one who made me start thinking about writing --
because this is the chance of a lifetime for our company , and there happens to be a deadline . there are millions of dollars at stake here . and our main competition had their project in three days ago !
yeah , but word around town is their project ' s a piece of shit !
he says he carried you on his back .
i didn ' t have much craft back then -- just a little native ability . <person> ' s a great ball- striker .
he ' s in love with a girl who ' s dead . it _is_ dangerous for you to have it . i ' m sorry .
i ' m so sorry , <person> .
how can we know ? !
we ' re going to tell them what we ' ve found . what we ' ve learned . <person> over a body infected with the gestating organism .
you see , sir ? he ' s not random at all .
we will attend to your horse . <person> him up best we can . treat him like the soldier he is .
did you see the paper ?
what section ?
<person>y , it ' s one fuckin ' beer for christ sakes . <person> , the big bad beer ' s gon na get ya . <person>y stares at the beer , weakening . healy i ' m worried about you , man . you better learn to have a pop once in a while or you ' re gon na fall off the wagon . you ' re being a fanatic and that ain ' t healthy .
am i ?
no police . not yet . we shadow him .
he ' s trying to outrun the traffic .
<person> away , colonel .
he is an impostor . there ' s no <person> at miratom .
we really do have so much in common . but i refuse to be upstaged .
you don ' t wan na fuck with me , man .
some numbers suit you better than others . what are you doing here ?
business , business . meeting a fellow here .
a twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning .
did you confess ? <continued_utterance> your fingerprints were all over the bedroom .
<person> ' s play it safe . <person> ' s assume that he will .
reacting to this possibility .
i hope this is not an indication of advancing age , getting kissed out of gratitude .
you didn ' t expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to ?
really , what a coincidence . am i disturbing you ?
only in a good way . <person> down . <continued_utterance> it must be nice having an analyst in the family .
no . there ' s no way . i mean , don ' t you think there ' s no way ?
well , no , i don ' t see any way .
i wasn ' t disbarred , they dropped the pro .
and it seems to me , a fella ' s trying to come back , he ' d take this settlement , and get a record for himself . i myself would take it and run like a thief .
set one up .
so who you out sleuthin for now ? .
have it your way . but you want it .
<person> gone off with <person> .
but i want a baby . a family ! i want to burp him and change him and . love him ! why couldn ' t it have been with me ?
<person> , honey , we ' ve been over this . you as a father ? think about it . <continued_utterance> you know i actually have considered naming him `` <person> '' .
then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .
and some really fast cars .
we have to keep him . we ' ve no choice .
right . well . you ' ve got one month to break him in or i ' m taking him back myself . how did you get to thirty - what other fool bid you up that high ?
maybe i ' m missing the point here , but if he paid twenty-four hundred , which is the cost of the job , i can ' t see anything wrong with that . i don ' t know the guy , but i don ' t quite get the problem .
what we ' re getting at here . what we ' re trying to stress , is that the job was sold under false terms . the man didn ' t win any award . he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price . a clear case of deception was involved here .
yes . <continued_utterance> i ' m looking for a young gentleman by the name of botts . <person> ?
<person> ' t know anything about that .
yes i did . i sure did . the bad side of it is i did some drivin for a man named <person> .
oh shit .
have you seen the latest bi-annual at the whitney ? incredible ! have you seen it , <person> ?
no , i haven ' t had the time lately .
<person> ?
i wanta go back to texas .
<person> is not the most rational man in this world . i tried to talk to him . he wouldn ' t listen . so , what are my options ? you know what i ' m saying ? what are my options ?
i can ' t believe you had to shoot pool ! <person> ' t you understand that . don ' t you understand how crazy that is ? you ' re sitting there . you ' re eating your eggs as if it ' s normal business in life here ! like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books .
what would a law firm want from the new drug <person> ?
depends on the state .
where i ' m at is maybe <number> .
<person> again ?
<person> ? can ' t imagine why . <continued_utterance> where ' s the nearest telephone ?
telephone ? the gunthers across the valley . they ' re mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even .
i showed up with someone from the labor board and we refused to leave until they let us in .
what are you suggesting ?
i care !

you know , i hear the new cadillac ' s gon na be out in a couple of months .

not as scary as a hoover man with a computer .
hey , hey , hey . j . <person> would ' ve loved you . he ' d love anybody who joined the bureau to , what was it ? `` to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests '' ?
creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts .
but rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones . <continued_utterance> it ' s a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others . the question is , which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control ?
these are fossilized bone fragments i ' ve been able to study , gathered from the bomb site in dallas .
you ' ve been back to dallas ?
i have to admit , i always felt .

we had a run-in , he and i . he knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me . <person> stands . she begins to tremble .
what did he say ?
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster . he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster . <continued_utterance> he says there ' s something wrong with <person> -- he ' s crazy , he says you stopped the inipi ceremony last night . ? <continued_utterance> but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you .
<person> . if someone wants you dead , it is <person> . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .
but you would have something to gain by killing <person> . and stopping his pipeline .
did you make me a tape ?
i already made you two tapes .
you ' re a little touchy about it .
i ' m not touchy , i just , it ' s a silly question , that ' s all . am i <person> ? are you happy ?
i don ' t care what you say about him . the boy has got it bad .
he ' s always got it bad as long as i ' m running in the other direction . <person> ' t be fooled , he ' s no different than any other guy . he knows how to chase and that ' s it . once he ' s caught you , he don ' t know what to do . so he runs away .
uh oh , it ' s <person> . she wants another load of firewood .
forget it , man . it ' s not worth it .
stop it !
there ' s more .
i can run . i got no problem with that .
they don ' t seem to have a problem with it either . mcmanus nobody runs .
what ?
they ' re screaming for starbursts .
i ' m thinking .
no thinking . the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
we ' ll see you the first week in january then ?
yes you will . unless i run off and become an outlaw or something . <continued_utterance> i have to go .
get off him .
he snuck in here thinking we were asleep , only i wasn ' t sleeping . would have slit our throats if i hadn ' t stopped him .

<person> , i want you to see a doctor . now <person> and <person> have a good man . he helped <person> through his breakdown .
and that ' s why you ' re doing all this ? for fifteen hundred dollars a month ?
isn ' t that why you did it ?

another reason ? ? ? did i miss something ? ? ?
if you don ' t hand over that dog , i ' ll bring a damage suit that ' ll take your whole farm ! there ' s a law protecting folks against dogs that bite !
how would it be if she keeps him tied up ? he ' s really gentle -- with gentle people , that is .

<person> died .
i know . i was there . i saw the whole thing . if i was your therapist , i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation .
so did <person> . she ' s in it too .
sounds like a good one .
everything these days is made overseas .
you and <person> hit it off so well .
why did he go to see <person> ?
she ' s the only nurse who isn ' t testifying for the doctors .
but i really don ' t think that i want action . me , i mean . the bearer of the excited bioport . what i want is . not now . not here . i feel too . too exposed .
my baby here has now taken three major hits , one in the church , one in the gas station , and one on the operating table . the only way i can tell if everything ' s ok - the game ' s not been contaminated , the pod ' s not fucked - is to play existenz with somebody friendly . are you friendly , or are you not ?
where am i supposed to go ?
up to you . from now on you ' re completely on your own .
<person> , <person> , this heres the man himself . <person>by , this is <person> and <person> , the most recent strandees , economic variety .
<person>by <person> , just like the country .

<person> ' s just not get worried about anything just now .
after all this mess then .
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front .
if you start in on the war metaphors i ' m going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole .

who says im smart ? you up to somethin with <person> peru , <person> ?
what could i be up to , <person> ?
uh huh . <person> .
it ' s not okay . it ' s extortion .
yes ! my job is to find a story , then tell a story -- whatever it is -- because i believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow , through information alone , we all have a better chance to survive . i believe in information . that ' s a very romantic streak i have running through me -- maybe it ' s a weakness . information is good -- lack of information is bad . <person> , eh ?
not so simple .
thank-you , <person> . you had me going for quite a while there , sport .
what are you talking about ?
filby ! i expected more of an enthusiastic greeting from . filby i ' m afraid you have me confused with my father , sir . there was a remarkable resemblance . - i ' m <person> . <continued_utterance> was ?
were you a friend of father ' s ?
they say f . d . r . stands for `` featherduster . `` that you ' re a lightweight . a dilettante with no substance ; no point of view .
is that what you think ?
really . how amazingly ironic . sybil the astrologer .
<person> moon turned out to be in somebody else ' s house , as i recall .
there ' s always a slip-up or two during a change in command . the men get a little loose . but i know i ' m leaving them in good hands .
thank you . <person> , take me to headquarters immediately ! we ' ll have those men turned out on the double !
not a whole helluva lot . his final transmission was mangled . about something or someone called `` ahab '' . whatever it is , it cost him his life .
he was the best there was . that makes three agents lost .
nobody cares about me at home . they wouldn ' t even miss me .
aw , come , come , come --
so . you think it could be a cure ?
i don ' t know .
all we can do now is hope our plan works .
you think the cops have our phone bugged ?
captain , i want you to maintain contact with those ships . do nothing until i order otherwise . is that clear ?
yes , mr . president . contact only .
mr . <person> ?
<person> : brian .
it ' s a whatzis ?
whozat ?
maybe we shouldn ' t .
then we ' ll never make it .
who put my client in the hospital for life .
i didn ' t do it , <person> .
sure . <person> growing up with a dad who sees every stage of growing up as a freudian passage . did you ever have crayons ?
sure .
i think something happened , something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him -- <person> walks in .
what happened ?
tie up <person> , too .
he ' s dead .
<person> .
remember our friend <person> ? well , i didn ' t know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother ' s apartment . turns out there is no diabetic mom . <person> said she ' s been dead for ten years .
because if you ' re such a baby you got ta tell your mommy about us playin ' pool when i totally asked you not to , and i got ta listen to her shit all day , then you ' re goin ' to the baby-sitter ' s so you can stay at the baby house .
but i didn ' t tell her !
what do you mean ?
you know it and i know it .
i need you to pick up the cake tomorrow .
<person> ' t we already have someone to do that for us ?
i wish i was leaving with you tonight .
your day will come . i never thought mine would , but it did . was all that stuff about <person> and <person> made up ?
why ?
oh , <person> . call the police .
i know this is difficult for you , but there ' s been no mistake . the house and all their assets , including your father ' s practise , are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage .
but i ' m telling you , my father put away every penny he ever earned . they owned that house outright . why would he have a mortgage ?
your parents would be crushed to think you weren ' t happy with it .
they ' re not my parents , <person> . my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much .
i ' m glad you let me talk to you . you used to not let me talk to you .

nine-one-one ? oh , sure .
four hundred dollars . i ' m giving you commission on two house referrals before i put a panel on the side of your house . that ' s how confident i feel .
you think that many people are going to .
so , what ' s the scoop ?
we got ' em !
give me the good news first .
your gluteus maximus is better than i hoped . it will serve you well .
<person> , i am your friend .
i know you are and you don ' t have to do anything crazy to prove it .
almost . i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat .
got anyplace special in mind ?
okay . i want you to hear this too . we ' ve got to be cool . all of us . people think i ' m rich , for <person> ' s sake . i ' m doing what rich guys do . i ' m spending my money . it ' s more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing . now don ' t let this cop fuck with your minds .
but i .
are they going to kill you ?
<person> to me , <person> ! i want you to go across the new corn to <person> ' . run as fast as you can . and stay there !

all the professionals keep them in the trunk .
not <person> .
with what ? i said , go right on ahead with what ?
whatever , dude .
what happened ?
he never came .
it ' s called good music . you should try to familiarize yourself with it , instead of listening to the crap you do .
i listen to crap ?
you think that ' ll help ?
can ' t hurt . and i think it ' s important you find out what she wants .
and he can hear a cricket passing gas in niffelheim .
<person> not ! he heareth all !
<person> .
you say its straight ahead a mile ?
we are gon na die . i ' m outta here ! <continued_utterance> locked ! there ' s got ta be another way out of here .

i don ' t need you spying on me .
spying ? !

of what ? what were you so afraid of ?
i was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee .
i don ' t drink coffee . <person> want ?
whatever you told them in there , you don ' t have to protect me .
all i told them was the truth .
actually , i used to be one of those animals . <continued_utterance> i fought for a living . <continued_utterance> guess i forgot to put that down on my application .
<person> , i guess you did .
he ' s a good horse , sir . but if you move him up to the heavy gun , he will be no use at all . prince is already losing condition . his leg , sir .
you have given them names ?
you ' ve been around .
i guess i ' ve got wander in my blood .
it ' s not what you think , <person> .
no , but it don ' t matter anyway when you ' re lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i ' m telling <person> about this drifter , didn ' t have enough money to fix his car . and <person> happened to find his gun , and through maybe this drifter heard old <person> got some money stashed away , and figgered he might try to break in and steal it !
. got a <number> on me , you .
not in here dad . please . later .
get it through your head , little girl ; i ' m not going for you . if this <person> likes you , then if i were you i ' d marry him . you ' re not going to get much better in this town .
that ' s what i thought until you came riding in . i saw your car over at the gas station . it ' s a cool car . want to take me for a ride ? <person> ' s kind of lonely this time of day .
hey , <person> . what ?
what does <person> ' s father look like ?
i said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something , they can ' t just turn around and take it back .
oh , honey , <person> . <person> ' t start with that again .
is it future ? or is it past ? . do you know who i am ? . i am the arm . and i sound like this .
where is the ring ?
no .
then i will shoot .
yeah . i ' m thinking about <person> ' s <person> fixation . you know how <person> was always harping `` immaculate reception ? '' i ' ve seen that play . a lot of times . and i have to say this . <person> was lucky . flat out , right place , right time . that ' s it . he was where the ball bounced . you get me ?
i guess .
your grades for fall semester .
you came here to give me my report card ?
what can i do for you , lad ?
i was hoping we could talk .
he implied it .
well you ' re a writer , and a lot of writers are gay . <person> at truman capote .
and if i were you i ' d be a little nervous about firing an employee i just had an affair with . ok ?
that ' s -- <person> ' t threaten me , <person> : i ' m not threatening you . i -- it ' s just an area i think we should explore .
how long we going to keep this up .
until we ' re out of the mine field is how long .
you won ' t get away with this !
good-day , <person> . i advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .

you said you couldn ' t kill anybody .
we don ' t have to kill him . just knock him out and tie him up ' till we get away . it was your idea , remember ? i ' m doing this for you . i ' m doing this so you can fly . fly like a bird . <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> ?
he tried to kill us . if not just now , then in the helicopter . that ' s all the authority i need .
we don ' t need to do this . we got the gold , all right ? <person> ' s just get out of here .
yes , thank you very much .
<person> said you ' re <person> .
next round ' s on me .
<person> , mister , i ' ve got my own money . so , if you don ' t mind .
<person> .
because no matter how much you claim to `` love '' me , you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of <person> !
i never lied about it --
`` <person> . just call me <person> . `` as if you were one of those stupid <number> -year-old girls with no last name . `` hi , i ' m <person> . `` `` hi , i ' m janice . `` what ' s wrong with them ? <person> ' t they know you ' re supposed to have last names ? it ' s like they ' re a whole generation of cocktail waitresses .

<person> , six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student .
<person> .

you ' re kidding ! that son-of-a- bitch !
<person> ' t worry , i told him everything he had to know , and i made her four bott .
excuse me , sir , what ' s going on here ?
commander , if you are fired upon , the president will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you . he doesn ' t want to have to do that . it ' s very important that he doesn ' t , or things could go very badly out of control .
what the hell is that ?

my father was a weakling .
he was a great king . not like your step-father , not like your mother . he ruled <person> with kindness , and a generous heart .
we lost everything , boss ! we owe <person> twelve thousand bucks !
i think i been dating too many big-haired blondes .
you know , i never had friends like this .
me either .
wow . so who cleans it ?
it needs no cleaning .
she was no longer with us . she was with him . <continued_utterance> she explains it now as the confusion of her new life outside the academy . that i misread her capacity for this kind of work .
then why are you still using her ?
and now ! for our final amazing bit of magic , i will make an entire pig completely disappear !
<person> ! <person> ! <person> !
i don ' t believe we ' ve met .
<person> . <person> sloviak --

it ' s what i ' ve been working for .
i just wish you could have heard her .
no one knows much about them . but i knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation . shield showed up , and he was never heard from again .
i ' m not going to let them do this .
thank you , <person> . a big score ?
maybe our biggest . i ' ll see you two doors down from your place at <number> : <number> .
oh , <person> , you ' re funny .

oh . i . where ' s <person> ?

good . i ' m good .

yes .
i haven ' t been able to recall a single moment of that day . until now .
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind .
this is a working ship . promptness is not a luxury , it ' s a necessity , as is the work to maintain her . had we been ready , i can assure you we would have sailed .
oh shit . oh shit !
what ?
<person> ? what the hell ' s the matter with you ?
i . nothing . i just stubbed my toe on a rock . <person> like hell .
i haven ' t even heard of half these bands .
it ' s called good music . you should try to familiarize yourself with it , instead of listening to the crap you do .
<person> wouldn ' t kill two innocent guards .
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?
-- or was she too prejudiced and mr . <person> too proud ? i can never remember . it wasn ' t personal --
-- it was business . what is that supposed to mean ? i am so sick of that . all it means is it ' s not personal to you , but it ' s personal to me , it ' s personal to a lot of people . what ' s wrong with personal anyway ?
now , <person> , dear , stop imagining things . you always get yourself into a fret over nothing .
no --
i don ' t have a wife . well , i do - but not a real wife . <person> . look . someone else sent that note . someone who --

one thing that has been troubling me . that lamp at the diner . do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring ?
well , if you move at a decent clip , you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow . should still give you time to take it all in and make it down .
any particular path ?

i don ' t think they ' re too good for you , not a lot of ' em anyway .
it was the least we could do .

<person> . i was wonder --
<person> ' s all right but he ' s no match for the melancholy dane . <person> , dear friend , the supreme role of any actor worth his salt .

i am really sorry about this .
my god .
he said he was the brain trust . said he was smarter than all of us . he started reading `` <person> , '' staring at himself in the mirror .
<person> , but now i have to go .

turn the car around .
<person> , i beg of you . the american army is there . i am iraqi . they will kill me .
how long have you had this kid ?
a few months .
that ' s a reasonable question for a reporter to ask , isn ' t it ? ! i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this is the way it ' s going to be . i ' ll make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there . i ' m gon na show up to work at rockefeller center every morning and they ' re gon na hand me the news with my coffee and toast . i shoulda never come down here , eh ? this war down here belongs to you guys , okay ? i ' m on tomorrow ' s plane .
<person> .
come on , that wouldn ' t make me gay .
i ' m going to fix you up with my new assistant .
i guess your father ' s not a union representative on that company .
what ? how do you know about my father ?
i ' m on the way with a team to relieve you . what ' s the latest ?
they retrofitted <person> with some kind of rocket launcher . they were loading canisters of liquid into it , light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate . something tells me this it that `` classified '' stuff you didn ' t want me to know about . does the song `` <person> '' mean anything to you ?
i want to check the set-ups for tomorrow ' s insurance convention . <continued_utterance> give me a shot from his wedding band .
he took it off .
<person> ' s say for example -
this i had to see myself .
<person> ' s so uncool . so boring .
you liked him well enough last night . ' oh , <person> , i just love my rifle so much ! it ' s the bestest present ever ! '
hey <person> , you think i could practice with you guys tomorrow ?
<person> , if you want . sure . and by the way , what i did in there today , yelling like that . i don ' t usually do that .
do you think i didn ' t know about you all along ? my contacts in the kgb told me you were coming . you show up undercover and , i must admit , you play your part to the hilt . when it ' s time to be cruel , you are cruel . when it ' s time to be passionate , you are very very passionate indeed . <continued_utterance> i could have killed you , but i thought this would be so much more fun . to twist you and use you how i see fit . and to be honest , you went much farther than i ever expected you would for your country . <continued_utterance> and you . why do you have such a problem staying away , my friend ? did you miss us that much ?
i wanted to get the hell out of prague before <person> falls .
you know , there ' s nothing wrong with neatness . people joke but it ' s actually a sign of a creative intelligence . <person> , <person> ?
in isolated cases , sure .
do you like my music ?
it ' s vivid .
you ' re walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .
why do you need to wreck this company ?
yes , we are working on processes . but it . you ' re specifically not at the stage where we can experiment --
experiment . use me .
she ' s the worst combination : stunning looks and a brilliant mind .
if she ' s so smart , how did she get caught up with <person> ?
what ?
i ' m thinking about taking a trip .
you don ' t know what you want --
you don ' t either . take a look at yourself . maybe you ' re scared that someone might actually like you --
i got him on loan from disney .
<person> ' t you the lucky one .
where are you going ?
on a cruise around the world .
the jupiters are obsolete . they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
-- <person> , <person> and <person> . i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article ! but you wouldn ' t listen to me . what if there hasn ' t been a coup at all ? what if it ' s you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade ? <continued_utterance> and if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole , you ' re so wrong . it ' s a deuce . <continued_utterance> and it ' s not just me who thinks that . everyone on this so-called excom is telling you exactly the same thing : make the trade , and they ' re going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won ' t trade like <person> , and we do end up in a war . not to mention , that long before that happens , this government will be politically dead .
we thought it was just .
you thought it was just .
she ' s there . but you can ' t go there . the island is cursed .
<person> ? who cursed it ?
i ' m finished at three . no . <person> with <person> .
after that .
your father is a murderer and a thief . he stole what was ours , and left our world in ruins . we have the right to reclaim the casket .
not when you ' d use it to make war against other realms .
we open two weeks before thanksgiving .
i guess we should announce ourselves soon . tell people we ' re coming .
if she ' s not now , <person> will make sure she is by the end of the evening .
has he asked to see the book yet ?
you interested or not ?
maybe , <person> , baby . maybe . i have friend who has what you want . his stuff is the best .
we don ' t have to wait for the swelling to go down .
you ' re going to port into me ?
thirty seconds . that ' s the most brilliant part of the plan , mr . <person> : to save the economy , i ' ll let the new british government - my british government - announce that the gold was irradiated in <person> - where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years . and just by coincidence : <continued_utterance> . gold mine opens in vietnam . <person> ' s go . put them in the airlock .
you ' ll never get away with it , <person> . too many people know .
andlt ; andlt ; he says that is fine . andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; no , no , no . i need a guarantee from the ridiculous man . i am going to be killed . i have seen the devil and looked him in the eye . andgt ; andgt ;
<person> ? whaddaya want ?
have you got the will ?
well , after i worked on him -- thought i ' d let him rest . left the room for a bit . when i came back , he was gone .
well , where was he ? where did he go ?
that storm ' s going to start ripping any minute -- so we don ' t have much time . <continued_utterance> we ' ve got to find <person> . when we find him -- we kill him .
why ?
okay , so who are these guys ? why they mad at you ?
i have absolutely no idea .
<person> ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable . a smear on the drafting board .
<person> , everybody thought so . but me and <person> got a kick out of <person>s . all <person>s . we couldn ' t see the bad in ' em . and when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the first national bank of <person>town , we took his case . but when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . we went to his house to take him in . but he was wise .
at the photographer ' s studio getting a gold frame with floral monograms of your birthday and our wedding vows .
<person> birthday , <person> .
<person> ' s .

this is so typical . i can ' t believe you . i ' ve barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this ? are you out of your mind ?
<person> , what are you doing ?
i don ' t know . i find this disgusting but i can ' t help myself .

. i have to stand up for her .
that ' s it . ? come on , guys . life is too short . you tell me if you ' re playing ' chicken , ' or you mean it . <person> : i don ' t think i ' m talking out of school , but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand . and that ' s a lot of money . and if i may say , you haven ' t got the best of records .
. things change .
must be so tough raising a kid on your own . although i ' m beginning to get the idea my wife wouldn ' t mind a crack at it .
oh . it ' s just the hormones .
where we going hiking ?

<person> , you ' re right . the kid has man strength , dude .

after i got out of the army i sat down and figured it out ! who never got in trouble in the army ? the m . p . ' s ! they were the ones who arrested you ! so i came back here and ran for sheriff !

ain ' t our way . we go all on one , one on all . fight one of us , you fight us all . that ' s the cowboy way .
and how come you call yourselves cowboys ? cowhands ride for the brand .
confusing . but not really . because it ' s nothing .
where did you meet him ?
a little shaky . sore wrists . bruised heel . <person> says she ' ll be fine . did you catch the bull ?
she ' s in the menagerie .
-- we need this one , dean . the quarantine ' s legal if we get a mandate , otherwise it ' s an act of war in the eyes of the world . get me that vote . make it unanimous .
mr . president , the organization of american states hasn ' t had a unanimous vote since -- the president moves for the cabinet room .
i can ' t remember all these things .
the art of transformation !
well . it sounds like your dad never learned to leave his work at the office .
lot of good it does me !
ah , i had a tough day . some jerk d . k ' d me and i got ta cover his loss .
<person> will ya .

ive got about five hundred dollars in my wallet and i cant find it . my mothers going to kill me . its got all my cards in it . it was in my pocket . now my pockets gone .
what ?
you -- <person> : you said to me , ' if not now , when . '
sure . set me up and then don ' t tell me .
<person> , just ask yourself . what do women really want ? you take these bored housewives , married to the same guy for years . <person> in a rut . they need some release . the promise of adventure . a hint of danger . i create that for them .
how do i look ?
like the most beautiful woman on earth .
i never saw anybody turn so many shades of red .
i can ' t wait to see the pictures .
so why are you wearing his watch ?
you ' re smarter than you look , frank . <continued_utterance> and you ' re right . here , take it .
since when ?
since the beginning .
sure , if that ' s what you want . why not ? it ' s all human nature . so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it .
and here i thought `` anarchy '' was just something cool to put on a tshirt .
i ' d like to ask you a few questions about <person>
sheriff cable ' s already asked me a few questions about <person> . she worked nights for a month . that ' s it .
why didn ' t you tell me ?
i didn ' t know who i could trust .
or else her hair . does she have lots of hair ?
my grandson , y ' know , he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it ! and i know some kids who are totally bald at a year- and-a-half . so , y ' know , how much hair they have . doesn ' t mean a thing .
oh , well , that makes sense .
but everything in this game is so realistic . i don ' t think i really could .
eio rule one , man . <person> . now you can do your terriforming stuff right when those space shuttles are gone .
but what about the martian people ? out cause ? i thought you believed in it .
you ' re son just burned down half of <person> ! come and get the little brat !
wait a minute , estelle , aren ' t you going to punish him ? i ' d say he deserves a good hiding .
see , i ' ve got a little problem .
it doesn ' t . sound life-threatening .
just looking for work , sir .
can you fly ? set yourself on fire ?
what do you mean , walked ?
your aliens , <person> , your little green men , first landed here millions of years ago . those that didn ' t leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age . in the form of an evolved pathogen . waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet . using us as hosts . <person> this we have no defense . nothing but a weak vaccine . do you see why it was kept secret ? why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known ? <continued_utterance> <person> , we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism . that mass infection would make us a slave race .
yes .
but you can ' t tell us what she wanted to talk about .
this is a soviet mirv-six , from an ss- <number> n launch vehicle . the warhead contains <number> . <number> kilos of enriched uranium , with a plutonium trigger . the nominal yield is <number> kilotons . release her and i ' ll cooperate . <continued_utterance> what can i say ? i ' m a spy .
you bastard ! ! you lying son of a bitch ! !
<person> .
rescind the order . can all the chiefs . <person> , <person> and the undersecretaries in charge .
yet we taught `em opposite . running into the fray .
war horse .
do things together that are enjoyable .
what would we do together for it to be enjoyable ?
so whered you say you was ?
went with <person> . <person> sits on the bed and starts undressing .
where do you picture me , <person> ?
<number> pennsylvania avenue .
that ' d better not be who i think it is . <continued_utterance> hello . what ? . that ' s okay . thanks for calling , bessie . <continued_utterance> that was my service . that patient -- the one who called earlier -- committed suicide .
oh leo , how horrible .
frisk them . see if they have the will .
get your hands off me , you little rodent !
that ' s none of your business , i ' m sure . shall you do my front too ?
i ' m up for it .
well , not anymore , thelma , except for bustin ' parole , i haven ' t done one wrong thing .
what did ya do ?
<person> , now is probably not the best time for this .
no , this is the perfect time . this is real time . <person> . your brother and i , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you . . are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy butt-fucker .
what did i do ?
you don ' t know what you ' re talking about ! there was nothing else i could do ! i can ' t explain it better than that , but you can ' t go on like this because you don ' t know anything about it and you don ' t know what you ' re doing !
psst . <person> .
i was wondering what happened to you . did you get to blow your wad ?
i mean i --
you mean in scottsville ?
a blue rose .
<person> good , but i can ' t tell you about that .
<person> , mr . <person> . may i come in ? i won ' t be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you ' re holding trained on me .
all right . come in .
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we ' re talking spring break !
cut it out , before you break something !
oh yes . <person> to you and <person> . who ' s <person> ?
<person> is our dog . this is a disaster . what the hell does she mean trent wants to mend the relationship ?

commander <person> . <person> reporting as ordered !
<person> , i want to know just one thing . those bastards shoot so much as a bb gun at you ?
you and my mother would have a special connection .

then i wouldn ' t see you .
you are my son .
am i ?
uh .
fuck you . i got a call today from <person> .
she threw up in her mask , yes . but she hadn ' t eaten one hour prior to admission .
if she had eaten , say one hour prior to admission , the inducement of a general anesthetic . the type you gave her . would have been negligent . ?
it ' s better than real . it ' s synthetic flesh . <person> blood . <person> organs . it ' s a physiological machine .
this is supposed to be years away .
well . i should get back to work . <person> ' ll be down soon and that path ain ' t gettin ' clear on its own .
excuse me . <person> ?
hey ! take it easy . want to get us killed ?
you don ' t know what it feels like to be free of that place .

just like that --
the supreme sovereign of sexuality .
<person> . but . that ' s the thing . i ' ve never even actually .
why does he need money ?
he has debts . he has gambling debts . he owes a lot of money .
<person> <person> . <continued_utterance> call me irish , but i don ' t believe in cooler heads prevailing .
<person> ' s scenario is unacceptable . and he has more experience than anyone .
update .
<person> ' s gone . <person> that may or may not be his leads out to the garage . two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle .
oh , you can ' t rest now -- we ' re nearly there ! mcu - lion yawns and speaks -
what did she -- do that for ?
you made me a composite of <number> of the most vicious people who ever lived . what do you think i ' m doing ?
i ' m begging you . please don ' t kill me ! please !
no . i don ' t .
why ? it ' s so obvious she ' s just wants him for the money .
um . i ' d rather not say . just yet .
<person> .
i thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why didn ' t you buy a nice big power boat ?
come on , man . i ' ll make a sailor out of you yet .

i don ' t want to wait for you again . we ' ve been circling each other since the montreal olympics .
eh ? nothing ? <person> , you bring this man to our house . with his gun of the hand . you bring fear to this house . fear of english with guns coming after . you bring blood and whispers of more blood . now english music . and you are dancing to english music ! and you call this nothing ?
i have committed no sin .
who else could it have been ? it was probably around <number> --
i mean , it ' s not like he was something normal , like a socialist or an anarchist or something --
yeah . now , i want you to look at these photos and then i ' m going to destroy them . <person> ' s testimony is also in here . it won ' t exist . she ' s not going to press charges .
press charges against . me ?
red dress , strappy shoes ?
that ' s right ! <continued_utterance> i think she ' s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
will you shut up and help me out ?
<person> , <person> . what should we do ?
left an hour ago . emptied my safe .
<person> . he ' s wise .
that ' s if the war is even still going on . way things were shaping up it ' s probably long over .

about the time <person> left .
is that the best shot we can get ?
but you ' re forgetting one thing .
what ?
hell , i can ' t remember . <person> ' bly see him again though . tell you what . you leave the money with me , i ' ll see he gets it . as a favor to you .
i have to talk to him .

i can help you with the mental aspects of the game . you ' ve got <person> to be your swing doctor , i can be your head doctor .

i ' m over at southeast plaza . what was it we need to get for pilates ?
big day . you ' re a star .

i guess it ' s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
i ' ve got a lot of work to do . i don ' t want you coming over !
you know what your problem is , <person> , is you ' re so straight . i really mean that . you go to a private school , you wear a bra . no one can have a good time with you ! you know , <person> asked me to go out with him this weekend , and i was really really tempted because i like <person> . a lot . as much as you do . but i told him i couldn ' t , that i didn ' t think it was right because you were my friend --
`for profit -- mostly . '
i ' m not much good .
<person> . but i do know one thing : you ' re exactly like him . my father was born wanting only one thing : to be president .
and what ' s wrong with that ?
i know youre thinkin that i got moren some of my mama in me ? well , i couldnt help it . <person> , i really couldnt . im sorry for that guy , but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies !

get your head back in the game . there are lives at stake here .
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . <person> almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn ' t have to slaughter your sow .
the lesson being ?
he won ' t ! you can ' t kill an entire race !
what is this newfound love for the frost giants ? you , who would have killed them all with your bare hands .
that ' s funny . <person> ' t he pointing the other way ?
. go both ways !
if i had some soup i would have thrown soup at him . is there any law you can ' t throw eggs ?
mr . <person> claims he didn ' t break into your house .
probably the same things your friends were looking for last night ! <person> ' t mrs . <person> bring you a package last sunday ?
you mean the chocolate easter bunnies ? we ate them already . <continued_utterance> anyway , you have no idea how many packages we ' ve been getting lately .
i got a little carried away , i guess . i shoulda just laid up , made my par , and moved on .
<person> , i want to propose something -- as long as you understand this is professional -- we ' re not going out together --
that ' s ridiculous ! spooks -- that ' s . mcu -- lion and <person> -- tin man o . s .

you ' re not capable of it .
i pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
i don ' t know how to behave around an eight-year-old ?
that ' s right --
you ' re here for two years , three maximum . what ' d they promise you ? court appointment ? what ? district ? appeals ? not <person> . <person> ?
i ' ve come in to do a tough job and that ' s what i ' m going to focus on .

you and i have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent .
<person> .

<person> used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall .
<person> . that ' s right . so it is settled ? <continued_utterance> good girl .
<person> in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
we ' re gon na have to step in , <person> . <person> boys couldn ' t find a clown in a field of cactus . let me take care of it .
is it working yet ?
ask me a question i would normally lie to .
right . full of shit .
then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle . works like a charm : her ass will be white as snow in three hours .
<person> happens .
what now ?
chart us a course for the windward side .
that low passed through last night .
she ' s in the menagerie .
<person> .
it was dad . i swear .
well , the next time he shows up . bring him over . until then , i ' m not saying a word about this to <person> and neither are you .
no , this day . she said you both made offerings .
that might ' ve been <person> -- -
no grace , my hand ' s bothering me .
you think now that <person> ' s dead , there ' s all that money there and i don ' t need you anymore , and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and . pop ! <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you think i would ' ve done it if i wanted to ? what can i do to make you relax , baby ?
a little test .
what kind of test ?

some guy in california . his name is <person> .
<person> heard of him .
we did it ? whattaya mean ? didn't he force you ?
well , sure . but he was super-gentle , you know ? i mean , he raped me and all , but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes . i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started , it didn't seem all that terrible . it was over pretty quick , and after <person> just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there . i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off . then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich .
why don ' t you take a long walk off a short pier ?
excuse me , but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot ?
nothing .
you ' re going to let her just wait there ?
<person> no , baby . i wouldnta done that without tellin you .
that bastard <person> .
me ? oh , i ' m with your own management training program . i want to end up in marketing and public relations . the only thing i know about security is how to switch this thing on .
well , for example , we ' ve spent a fortune developing existenz , but we all know it ' s a risky project . she might have to make changes . it ' s the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem .
of course not ! <person> ' s like a daughter to me . her father and i taught at university together . a good man , but he never listened .
neither did i .
hey , <person> . how ' s it hangin ' ?
you ' ll never believe who called me , <person> . <person> !
at least that way things would have been clearer to begin with , y ' see . they wouldn ' t have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib , y ' know ? ' <person> nothing ever comes out of our rib , y ' know ? <person>r . only out of our prick , and even then . <person>rything still has to be done after that .
that ' s for sure .
how much you think ?
i don ' t know . they ' re pretty quick . fifteen seconds ? <continued_utterance> what the hell is that , anyway ?
then i ' m sure you can do it again .
and i ' m sure i can sue you for violating my constitutional rights !
whether in here or our there , i guarantee you the food will taste the same . terrible .
<person> ' t we pray first ?
and what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow ?
he only met you a few hours before me . he would do the same .

fish eyes ?
even if it offended someone , i wouldn ' t eat a fish eye .
they just stole my entire life ' s work . i really don ' t have anything left to lose .
but you ' re clever . far more clever than anyone else in this realm .
i mean , we ' re fine .
you ' re more than fine , you ' re absolutely fine .
what if you ' re wrong ? you just said she ' s the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ?
i did try calling her . a few years ago . she wasn ' t listed .
on my driver ' s license and credit cards , it says <person> . if you stole my wallet from the campsite . that ' s how you ' d have known .
you ' re accusing me of stealing your wallet ? i saved your life . twice . why would i steal your wallet ? now , just drink your primrose .
so you ' re in business for yourself now .

you may begin .
i had my whole life planned . i knew exactly where it was taking me . and then , with the opening of a door , it all vanished .
the last month maybe .
how long have you been smoking marijuana ?
oh ! oh , <person> ! help ! help me , <person> !
are you all right , <person> ?
dana , don ' t forget to feed <person> ! <continued_utterance> i ' m late .
me too . <continued_utterance> how ' d it go at the trade show ? you make all the other salesmen jealous ?
i ' m talking about the kind of people you hang out with . about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .
i asked you to marry me . i ' m ready for marriage . that ' s responsibility . that ' s growth .
what ' s this about ?
your good friend <person> .
i , what are you talking about ? i talked to her this morning , and she said .
she told me .
it wasn ' t nuclear . the bomb was a dud . the trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline .
and <person> ?
barbarism .
men call it justice .
yes , mr . president . these are nuclear missiles .
how long until they ' re operational ?
why ?
i don ' t know . i guess i needed something .
that is correct .
this is from the highest authority ?
where is it ?
on a bench , across the street . <continued_utterance> you calling me a liar ?
my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and <person> out of trouble was to send us to big daddy ' s farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama ' s hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . <person> will never have to bust his knuckles like we did .
i want <person> to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
bye `` honey ! '' i ' ll call you later .
when ? when ?
well , i did a little time , i guess , in florida . for , uh , just for bullshit .
what ? !
yeah . <person> honey , i ' ll be right in . i just . we ' re just taking care of some groomsmen last minute business .
everything okay ?
-that report is only useful to <person> now .
no . it ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that stemmons file . which i know you won ' t do until you figure out how it will best benefit you .
take a couple bottles of bleach , pour it over the trunk .
what do you got in there ?
i ' d say so .
how ' s that ?
you ' re gon na love <person> . trust me . it ' s crazy . this morning , i almost got a handie behind that pita stand .
well , i kind of have a girlfriend -- not a girlfriend , yet , but a girl i like , so i shouldn ' t --
what happened to your hand ?
i cut it on an old rusty knife .
i played the cards i was dealt , <person> . your problem is you ' re always trying to play someone <person> ' s . allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free : there is no happiness , <person> there is no normal life . there ' s only life , that ' s all . just life .
then what do i do ?
thanks , <person> .
i ' ll be blunt . i know you can take it .
<person> ?
three point five cc ' s .
you ' re not a team player .
<person> ' t point at me .
i need to talk to you .
that ' s funny . i need to talk to you , too . perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room , <person> .
i mean it ' s really kind of insulting .
can i say something here ? <person> asked me to come and talk to you , because it ' s her opinion that you ' re not gon na find what you ' re looking for the way you ' re looking for it --
yeah .
i want you to call <person> .
i love <person> . <person> ' s amazing . <person> makes coffee nervous . are we still on schedule ?

i don ' t want to meet your fancy friends . i knew ' em all back when i was fancy too .
four is what ?
it ' s trouble , that ' s what . not that i give a damn , but you ' re playing with dynamite with those two and you ' re gon na blow all of us up . <person> is the meanest sonofabitch i ' ve ever met .
i admit he has his moments of insanity but he ' s really a very generous , charming guy .
<person> , he just ate . <person> just stares at his friend . sully nineteen months i been sober .
what are you talking about ? you were never an alky , you were a cokehead .
thanks for straightening out <person> .
maybe we are crazy for doing this . but if we do it , we do it right . i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldn ' t have to do it again .
the cashier said it would be in a familiar place . is there such a thing here ?
my assembly bay .
<person> . <continued_utterance> <person> just took off . she asked me to do the run today . should i do it ?
what ' s with that <person> ? yeah , sure , take a look around . there ' s no one here anyway .
i don ' t wan na go mersh , you know that . but hey , if this is about money . <continued_utterance> i got an advance on the next bootleg . <person> ' s get out of here , just you and me . we ' ll chill out in bora bora for a couple months .
<person> ? this wouldn ' t last us a week in a cheap hotel . do you know how expensive it is down there ?
if i talk , you ' ll just think i ' m crazy .
with all the respect i can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories , <person> , trust me - you ' ve crossed that bridge .
uh oh , <person> ' s going for ride !
that one shook the entire building !
i ' m happy for him . although -- could i make a little suggestion ? i think you should meet him . no . i take it back .
i hardly think i need advice from someone who --
i mean , it ' s not like he was something normal , like a socialist or an anarchist or something --
it happened in spain . people do really stupid things in foreign countries .

<person> . i see . how much do you want ? <continued_utterance> you want more than this ? <continued_utterance> you want something else ?

<person> . thank you .
there are no vets . we ' ve scarcely any horses left .
he ' s cut all over , but this leg here ' s got the worst of it .
<person> is very sweet and very gorgeous .
i wonder if <person> could ever write a poem ? both of them drift off . donna do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster ?

what kind of time frame are we talking about here ?
mama . i been thinkin about her .
<person> likely .
. then buy yourself a decent bowling jacket so when you take <person> out you don ' t look like the roto rooter man . come on , for godsakes , that ' s what money ' s for . enjoy yourself .
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you ' re never happy ' cause somebody ' s always trying to take it away from you . <person> ' s one giant pain in the ass y ' ask me . thanks .
. i made a reservation at .
. apartment . no , no . <person> . you don ' t know who we ' re dealing with , i , please believe me , they .
you should come to our temple .
i ' m not really religious .
. see the villain ' s eyes . they ' re larger than the other characters ' . they insinuate a slightly skewed perspective of how they see the world . just off normal .
he doesn ' t look very threatening .
<person> .
and then we would never have been at war .
but he did . i ' m not saying i was right , but <person> can do a lot of things no one thought he could do . <continued_utterance> look , i said i was wrong now i ' d like to forget it . i ' d like you all to accept my apology .

<person> na untie your mouth , now . have a little `` man to man '' talk .
please . it ' s not too late . let us go . we won ' t tell anyone .
you are very sweet , but <person> has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him . he has a policy .
if you become a widow , you will need someone around to fix the whatnots . we like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge . i know <person> ain ' t gone yet , but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line . i just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal , to be first in line so to speak .
you lie in the middle of the road , look like you ' re hurt . when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head .
why do i have to lie in the road ?
right , which is probably why <person> was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation . let me ask you something , <person> , did you notice anything about the dress ?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her . i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in . it wasn ' t her dress or she must have lost some weight .
fuck .
what is it ?
i don ' t care for ultimatums disguised as debate .

what do you mean ?
her left arm . it was numb . she said she couldn ' t use it . said it had no feeling . probably from the drugs she was taking . i just thought i ought to tell you .
he ' s right there !
so if you ' re not treating him while he ' s here , then he ' s not a patient while he ' s here , is he ? and i have the right to see him !
i was looking through my trunk and i can ' t find my toby .
what ' s that ?
i don ' t know why they call it a `` home '' . you don ' t know anybody there . they fill you so full of drugs , you don ' t care . five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died . they take turns visiting me on weekends . they forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up . <continued_utterance> i had a life , ya know . a big life . it isn ' t right .
so , how did the benzini brothers stampede start ? the story is two guys got thrown off the train and --

i went to get myself a salad and i started to see all these vegetables , you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it ' s time to get to the main course you won ' t eat too much . that scam to get you filled up so you don ' t eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff .
<person> , yeah . i get the point .

i did not ! i did not kill anyone . <person> . <person> , listen to me . i walked in and she was lying there dead . i swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if i hadn ' t stopped by here before school , the painters would have --
i don ' t believe you .
pull over .
where ? why ?
yes . - i am sorry because i could tell so much to the people of my own time . i could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them . they could learn from it . or would they ?
you don ' t want to stay , do you ?
no . it ' s what it looks like . a big i . e . d . - ten gallons of astrolite . <person> , get everybody out of here and clear the building .
somebody ' s got to stay with you --

what ?
would you go upstairs and , and check on the children for me ?
this is weird , <person> .
<person> weird .
my friends would be more interested in this . <person> ' s preliminary : white paint chips found embedded in sanderline <person> ' s scalp . a matching dent on the white window sill . i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time <person> flew out of it . it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd .
<person> . where ' s this going ? gun ? <person> ? what ?
you know good and damn well what i ' m talkin ' about .
i mean really ! that business with your tongue . what is that ? that ' s disgusting !
i ' ll take that under advisement . maybe i can be like you and lose a leg for the old stars and <person> . i bet the flag ' s a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs .
one twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus . believe me , mr . x , i ' ve put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and i don ' t feel the urge to stop just yet . so think carefully before you tell me : is `` kiss my ass , hop- along '' your final answer ?
i am trying , <person> . <person> , i can get you <number> days to get even --
<number> days is not enough . my wife and i have three jobs between us and that doesn ' t cut it . so , what do you suggest ?
you can ' t be serious ?
why not miracle waters ? i ' ve drunk the oil of monkey glands , been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses . after all that , this sounds downright peaceful .
are you all right ?
i ' m okay .
we should play some time . i mean , if you can afford to lose some money .
what are you ?
i looked the other way when you did a lot of foul things but i <person> ' t lettin ' you torment a dyin ' man . not as long as he ' s under my roof . i draw the line there .
all right , hooker . i ' ll be back in about an hour . we ' ll see how <person> you are then .
so my wife is lying ?
<person> , think about it , if i was trying to rip you off , i would have left town after <person> was killed . i wouldn ' t sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .
like i said , open container , <person> . i . , misdemeanor possession . <person> to make it disappear . for you , poof , it ' s gone . <continued_utterance> one thing bothers me . that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him . serious amounts . he ' s lucky he lived . so i got ta ask : what ' s your daughter on ?

' cos if my crew can work on saturday next , that ' ll free my guys up on monday . <person> , that ' ll really help me out on another job . <person> , if we can do that , i think i ' ll be able to knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job . you see , i ' ve got an overlapping situation on monday . i don ' t want to go into it . what do ya think ?

can you even dye my eyes to match my gown ?
uh-huh .
cardiac arrest . during delivery her heart stopped . when the heart stops the brain ' s deprived of oxygen . you get brain damage . that is why she ' s in the state she ' s in today .
now , dr . <person> ' s testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . in your opinion is his estimate correct ?

look , i have no illusions about winning a popularity contest with any of you . i was roasted the other night , and a friend of mine asked -- why are we honoring this man -- have we run out of human beings ? <continued_utterance> it ' s not always the most popular guy who gets the job done . you got losses of <number> to <number> million dollars , dividends cut to zero , you ' re getting squeezed to death by the majors . present management may not be the worst scum of the earth , but they ' re the ones who ' ve put you on a kamikaze course , and pretty soon everybody ' s going to be scrambling for the parachutes . only there aren ' t enough to go around . management has them . you don ' t . if they throw <person> into <person> <number> -- which i think they will -- then they can use bankruptcy laws to break your unions and your contracts and throw you guys off the property .
with all due respect , mr . <person> , what ' s to prevent you from doing the same thing ?
i hate asparagus .

do you know what we do with people come round here ? you know what we do with people come in our business ? <continued_utterance> we cut the achilles tendon . your feet flop around like a marionette . you ain ' t walkin ' nowhere no more . <person> good , tough guy ? or maybe instead you wan na tell me something . <continued_utterance> <person> doing here ?

' least they don ' t scare women .
what happened to your confidence ?
he ' s shanking his love life so he ' s shanking the golf ball .
it ' s your chosen profession , geek . <continued_utterance> there ' s an intimacy involved in playing existenz that is beyond description . it has to be experienced . and frankly , the two-player version is the most exquisitely intense . <person> ' t you like to play with me ?
well , yeah , of course , but . let me , uh , let me call <person> .
i said buttplug . she ' s heinous .
all the same , i still want to call her . i know it sounds crazy -- <person> sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but , i don ' t know , maybe i can help her out . the poor thing ' s had it tough -- she ' s in a wheelchair for <person> .
it ' s a ' <number> <person> convertible .
except his was black and yours is white . and dirty .
shorthand . really ?
we ' re heading into a difficult situation .

because no matter how much you claim to `` love '' me , you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of <person> !
<person> to me ! <continued_utterance> loki !
it so happens i haven ' t been to this restaurant before . i don ' t know how they do their eggs . if they ' re over easy and they ' re gooey , i ' m not happy with it . and i ' m not happy if the soft boiled eggs are left in the shell .
can i have some french toast and a cup of coffee ? bagel , what do you want ?
i ' m single .
' pride goeth before a fall . '

ya , but you can ' t do the shuffle with one leg . you and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . now i ' m not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
all the people working with us are really doing it ' cause they hate to see suffering .
he ' s not so --
he ' s an idiot , and he ' s not nearly as hard as he thinks .
i ' m not sailing his boat .

are you going to let us in on what exactly you ' re trying to prove --
that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen , so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn ' t have to be explained --
i don ' t see patients on vacation , <person> . ever . how many ways can i make that clear ?
but you can ' t just send me away ! i ' ve read your book , i ' ve been doing what you told me , but i ' ve completely relapsed ! a little time would mean so much . <person> .

i do ? i mean , yeah , i do .
sometimes , i like being part machine . <continued_utterance> why didn ' t you tell me you had a daughter ?
i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
my husband can ' t know about this .
no one must know ! especially him . you must appear to live your life normally , conveying nothing . the security of this nation depends on it . can you do that ?
hey . it ' s me .
where are you ?
i know what he said .
you can go with <person> . he ' s taking <person> to school . but you ' ll have to hurry .
what ' s complicated about it ? she doesn ' t give a shit about <person> . they hate each other . you can ' t let her take him .
ok . ok . <person> , just go get ready for practice and i ' ll deal with it .
that ' s not true . it ' s just that <person> drives me crazy . she knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad .
<person> , it was a great party , everyone had a good time .
where ' s your head , <person> ? where do you think the pressure ' s coming from ? <person> - or whatever you want to call him - knows where i am right now . he ' s got the front burner under ' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . <person> was just to deal with you assholes . i got a whole new problem when i post bail .
so why play into his hands ? we can protect you .
so let me ask you something , <person> . how good are you ?
i ' m pretty good .
<person> no !
lost my eyes in vyee-et-nam . lost them fighting the commies . fought the war and lost my eyes fightin ' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me .
i give you the shirt off my back and you bash me !
when a superior officer tells you to leave the room , you leave the fucking room .
did it yesterday . franks and beans .
no . it was eggs . i did eggs .
<person> , <person> . <person> your meeting ?
in the darkest moments , it ' s what i live for . especially since i ' ve heard how much you like to watch . on the hidden camera .
oh , great .
they ' re flying him here right now . he was picked up this morning for parole violation . they also found about six grand on him , so he probably knocked over something while he was out there . they can drop him by here for questioning . i ' m so happy .
a bridge ? like an einstein-rosen bridge ?
more like a rainbow bridge . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> .

you will help me with my other problem .
i don ' t know . i ' m still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband ' s dog .
you ?
no . i haven ' t .
what ' s wrong , <person> ?
i said . i was raped .

<number> a . m . start tomorrow - travelling with the dragoon guards and the royals . <person> detachment - they ' ll need to be at the docks at <number> am . <person> all kit . battle orders : no polishing - buttons , helmet buckles , stirrup irons - let `em all go dull . i want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away .

<person> !
five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle .
competence .
what ' s to tell ?
what the hell am i after ? you ' re telling me dick .
that information is classified . you ' re there to gather information on their operations , period .
are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp .
that ' s what i am to you , isn ' t it ? swamp trash . it ' s what i am to everybody , just like my mom .
again . i think we covered this . i told her i was going to call a cab .
but she ran away .
nope , nope -- dodged a few bullets . god , i can not believe i ' m standing here with <person> .
<person> , it ' s <person> <continued_utterance> nope , haven ' t walked the plank yet . there was this guy back in college who was bothering me . got kind of ugly -- a restraining order , the whole bit . <person> , when i got out of princeton i changed my name as a precaution .
in regiments of horse and men , the advantage is ours .
and we have surprise on our side . but the sooner we move , the better - we have no assurance they ' ll still be there tomorrow morning .
that ' s absurd .
i ' ve seen it on television .
you can ' t take him out this late in the game .
<person> will eat him alive !
complete snowjob . and then we went out and told the country they weren ' t putting missiles into cuba . by the way , you realize we just lost the midterms .
who gives a shit about the midterms now ? the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us .
a couple weeks . that ' s why . that ' s why i had the gun . for protection .
<person> , <person> , you should ' ve told someone .
you know what i think you should do now . why don ' t you pull some files . some files that were completed , others that went unsold , and i ' ll have somebody run it down , talk to the customers and get some statements .
pulling files is another thing .
yeah . those . that always put the fear of god in me . what about you ?
well , to be honest , the idea of getting old with <person> was kinda startin ' to get to me .
hi . i ' m . <person> . <continued_utterance> dr . <person> . <person> wiley . thank you for working me in . <continued_utterance> your family ? <person> , let me guess . i ' m good at this . <person> , <person> , gretchen , <person> . <person> wait , i know i ' m close . <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> . <person> --
my wife , <person> . my son , <person> . my daughter , <person> . my sister , <person> .
nora tilley , please .
what department is she with ?
it ' s not a threat , it ' s a fact . if you don ' t haul those kegs away , you ' re dead where you stand . <continued_utterance> <person> hit the ground first .
<person> was taller .
but why ? you work right in the office -- nobody ' ll ever know .
i ' m surprised you ' d want help from anybody who fights for the pink team .
so , how did the benzini brothers stampede start ? the story is two guys got thrown off the train and --
no point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end .
the lake . i ' d kill to rinse off .
<person> . wait a sec . it ' ll be dark soon .
and don ' t be so goddamn sensitive . who cares what anybody thinks anyway ? you want to . be a good writer ? you want to be-a great writer ? then stop giving a damn what other people think . most of them haven ' t thought in . years . <continued_utterance> let me spell it . out for you , <person> . <person> don ' t mean anything . not to anybody . not anymore .
<person> ' s <person> meant something . <continued_utterance> i mean it . it means something to me . it ' s one of the reasons i came to school here . to be in your class . to be taught by you . it ' s one of the reasons i wanted to become a writer .
no . i mean yes .
let me see it .
why ?
it wasn ' t an accident that you and i ended up on the run together .
. he ' s a good man .
. he ' s a good man . ? he ' s the prince of <person> ' darkness . he ' ll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her tuesday on a surfboard at hyannis . don ' t fuck with this case .
thank-you . her name is <person> .
want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ?
it ' s just -- the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall . so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down .
why don ' t i just call the plumber ?
<person> . i have a speech to make . <continued_utterance> i like you people , but you are sentimental shits . you fall in love with the poets , the poets fall in love with the marxists , the marxists fall in love with themselves . the country is destroyed with rhetoric , and in the end we are stuck with tyrants .
<person> up !
so you admit it ?
guilty as charged . i ' m not gon na play games with you . i could give you a song and dance but what ' s the point ? i did it and we all know it . the hitcher himself told me it ' s illegal the irony .
<person> . i got ta find -- alright .
you got one ? <continued_utterance> `` warning shots '' , <person> . <continued_utterance> come on . next one . <continued_utterance> `` bullets '' by the editors .
nevermind . the point is we must elope .
i don ' t know , <person> . i do love you , but i don ' t want to spend the rest of our lives on the run .
maybe ! maybe he ' s like your black pete or something ! why the hell did you tell me that story anyway ?
you ' re crazy .
who ? bond ? bond is dead . <continued_utterance> somehow , i find that strangely . disappointing .
<person> . what time is it ?
damn it . have her fax some photos up here . <person> patrol .
been a while since we had a couple go missing . twelve months ago the last ?
admiral , i asked you a question .
we ' re going to follow the rules of engagement . the rules of engagement which the president has approved and signed in his order of october <number> rd . <continued_utterance> yes , captain , you may proceed . clear your guns .
my babies .
somebody broke in .
well -- can you tell me without like , denigrating what i believe in ?
because i think it ' s primitive , ok ? i think it ' s a fairy tale .
why ?
because it ' s freezing and i don ' t want his pipes to burst .
for murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
who said that ?
who are you ?
<person> . i was driving the car that --
<person> !
no , don ' t shoot ! <continued_utterance> it ' s just a mongoose .
are you an editor ?
yes .
sure it is .
<person> , antonia --
<person> ' t accuse nothin ' of not bein ' real , <person> . cuz the only thing around here that ain ' t real is you .
<person> care of yourself , <person> .
no .
oh , i thought i saw you .
you are so brilliant .
yep .
nice to be back . i ' m flattered you remember me .
part of my job , sir .
maybe we shouldn ' t make it .
if you ' re worried about anything , let ' s take that blood test of yours .
i might have an idea .
we ' re gon na have to come up with some kind of plan or it ' s just gon na wait us to death .
copped a tin of altoids at the car wash . dom nods , satisfied .
<person> , sounds like you ' re all set . just clean the pipes and it ' s a go .
both ?
uh huh .
and i was wondering .
<person> ?
interesting video tape .
they point , i shoot .
no . i wasn ' t even born yet .
were you ever in the army ?
i get paid the same way you do . what the fuck you doin ' in sebaco -- this place ' s about to blow . ain ' t it ?
you didn ' t have to nail <person> .
it really will do that , yes . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t hurt me , <person> . <person> ' t make me go back in alone . play with me .
<person> , i ' m worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth . i ' m thinking i was right never to have a bioport installed .
like you said , <person> . we ' re <person>s . got ta back your <person> ' s play . <person> did like i figured you would .
<person> to me , both of you . this is no good . this is trouble we <person> ' t need . for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family . do this and you throw it all away . you saw what happened to <person> .
on come on , x . did you really think we were that barbaric ?
no needles , huh ? what about the acid bath ?
i ' ve got immunity now . what can you possibly offer me ?
if there is a <person> he ' ll be looking for you .
you rotten bastard -- do you see me going out on any dates ?
look , it ' s with <person> -- i ' ve been after her for months already .
this better be one great plan !
get ready !
i have an appointment at , er . <person> .
they went bust . <continued_utterance> you got ta leave .
yeah .
why do you think ?
darryl . it ' s me .
thelma ! <person> !
what ?
hughes .
the worst , the worst -- i could never , under any circumstances , love anybody who had a sailboat .
neither could i .
you don ' t believe me ?
no , i don ' t believe you .
oh my god ! --
would you please let me --
it ' ll turn black again soon enough . then i guess i ' ll be losing the whole thing . . think my toes are already gone . <continued_utterance> so you ' re the only one who made it .
not the only one .
i got it .
do you want me to carry your pack for you ? <person> blurts out emphatically .
but i just --
you are a lone reed . <person> looks puzzled . <continued_utterance> you are a lone reed waving in the breeze standing strong and tall in the corrupt sands of commerce .
<person> .
we find the concept brilliant , but new york is difficult for new restaurants . how can we be certain that our money will be returned in the long run ?
<person> , you still got it , <person> . who ' s mr . jocularity ?
that ' s <person> , the gag king .
tell ' em your father gave it to you .
what if they call him ?
welcome to managua .
you have something to do with this ?
<person> , <person> . now ain ' t the time . i tell you , boys , even i ' m worried what ' ll happen once <person> runs this outfit ! god have mercy !
there ' s no god , there ' s no devil , i hate the god damn world ! i want to die !
you fucker , dont you ever touch <person> - you fucker , <person> kill you .
put your shoulders back .
. and you ' re even lovelier than i pictured . i brought a birthday present for mr . <person> .
first of all , mr . <person> , you can ' t just come barging in here . and what makes you think it ' s his birthday ?
there ' s no more time for games . they made you . there ' s a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye . tell me if it ' s true .
it ' s a long story , but yeah , more or less .
<person> ? ! oh , cool !
go wash your hands and i ' ll get molly ready .
well , i don ' t think . i don ' t particularly think anybody ' s life has any particular importance besides whatever -- you know -- whatever we arbitrarily give it . which is fine . i mean we might as well . i think i ' m as important as anybody else . <continued_utterance> i don ' t know : a lot of what you ' re saying has a real appeal to me , <person> . a lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids . but i don ' t want to believe something or not believe it because i might feel bad . i want to believe it because i think it ' s true or not . i ' d like to think that my life is important . or that it ' s connected to something important .
well , isn ' t there any way for you to believe that without calling it god , or religion , or whatever term it is you object to ?
you ' re god damn right it ' s not . you take that picture you ' ll take it for all the right reasons -- i understand .
i ' m not gon na take it .
but your instinct was to lose sail ?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted .
no .
he might like it if he ever went there and tried it .
well . that . is a perfect example of what i ' m talking about .
you are in idiot .
yes , sir . <continued_utterance> i ' d like to take <person> to dinner on new year ' s eve .
that won ' t be possible .
so what are you doing out here ?
it ' s colder in there . -
he ' s right . it was a stupid stunt .
excuse me ?
he ' s my roommate .
oh , i see , i see .
i baby stepped . i owe it to you .
<person> , take a look around you . what does everything you see have in common ?
what ? !
what ? ! what d ' you think ? !
you ' ve got ta get us closer so i can take a magnetic reading .
<person> , right ! good one ! oh god , you ' re serious .
do you think you could have parked any further from the entrance ?
there were still cars when i got here . i thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow ?
<person> . the gopher !
hey , don ' t i have any rights ?
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping <person> , or could be in little pieces on <person> beach . any idea what <person> ' s going to do next ?
until we know what new influences are affecting him , we can ' t be sure .
you ' ll be in miss graham ' s class ?
yeah , is she nice ?
all i have to do is take one small step at a time and i can do anything !
exactly . but don ' t expect everything all at once . even a baby occasionally falls and hits his head .
well , we can ask her . that won ' t hurt . <continued_utterance> <person> , this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride , and i thought since .
it ' s probably not a good idea .
i did ? i didn ' t see anything .
yeah . look in here . <person> at it from this angle . <person> puts his head inside the truck .
he ' s no friend of mine .
what the hell ' s going on here ?
him or him or her ?
well , here we are , eh ?
this guy doesn ' t even know how old his baby is and you don ' t find that strange ?
this guy asked for advice , i ' m giving him advice , <person> ? if you ' re so paranoid , why don ' t you run home and chain your kid to his crib ?
<person> , fine .
we had a class together , you know .
the ranger at base suggested <person> or .
. <person> . i think <person> only knows those two trails . well . between those , i ' d pick <person> . <person> will shoot you to the top , but there ' s not as much to see . <person> weaves through <person> ' s <person> , it ' s a better hike and prettier all around view .
a wormhole . <continued_utterance> <person> , look . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> . <continued_utterance> what do you see here ?
stars .
i have to tell you , i do enjoy you , parker . i really don ' t want to have to kill you .
what c- <number> . was <person> talking about ?
i ' d really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement . ok ?
i ' ll do my best . !
what ' re you doing ? the man told you there ' s no such bus .
he ' s lying . two , four , oh , six was definitely the number . <continued_utterance> i never believed he was dead .
<person> .
we find that your subscription lapsed .
oh , you poor sad multimillionaire . i feel so sorry for you .
i am going to take a wild guess that this isn ' t him , either . who is he , i wonder . not , i gather , the world ' s greatest living expert on <person> and <person> , but someone else entirely . will you be you be mean to him too ? will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly , miraculously , like a bolt from the blue , find that sharp little tongue of yours ?
oh , ted i ' m so sorry to hear that .
no , it was a good thing . i mean , good in that it was very quick .
unfortunately , <person> , i have a plane to catch .
call me , if you ' d like to see some of my other pieces .
no -- of course not .
i didn ' t think so . <continued_utterance> boo ! you see , i can ' t even scare a crow ! they come from miles . mcu -- <person> listening -- scarecrow o . s . <continued_utterance> oh , i ' m a failure , because i haven ' t got a brain . mcu -- <person> reacts , speaks --
. a bouncer ? are you serious ?
maybe he got promoted . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t . touch . anything .
have you lost your mind ? have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? and i need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling .
i ' m busy .
hold up , jefe . got a joke i wan na tell you .
he say he know you killing him .
you ' re pathetic .
see her ?
take care of business .
what does that mean ?
<person> , since you weren ' t able to be on time for this hearing , i ' m going to ask you to step outside so that we can get <person> ' s version of the facts . so that she won ' t have to be paid the same disrespect .
we were told the building was clear .
take the girl . leave the handcuffs .
enjoy the rest of your life .
<person> , it ' s really coming down . so what do you say ? how `bout a little christmas spirit here ?
you know , this is one bad stretch of road . all kinds of trouble going on up here : kids drag racing . niggers hauling booze across the state lines . <person> drivers breaking down , no-one ever hears from them again .
get up . get up .
hi , <person> .
no . no , thank you .
you ' re sure you ' re alright , sir ?
i have another appointment at one .
you ' ll miss it , i ' m afraid .
i don ' t know if they can do anything about it . it seems to be open season on me .
well , you will be safe here , i can assure you of that . i will contact <person> right away and have them send some people to come and collect you .
what does it mean for us ?
well , it could mean either a surprise visit from a former friend or sweetheart -- or that you ' re going on a long sea voyage !
maybe you ' ve got ideas of your own for the gold . maybe you ' ve already got things worked out .
maybe i do .
how ' d you know ?
i got one up on ya .
that will be no easy task . it ' s said the gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away .
and he can hear a cricket passing gas in niffelheim .
what else do you want from me ? huh ? what else ? ! i ' ve got enough problems with the i . r . s . busting my balls and the home improvement commission bullshit to contend with . i don ' t need aggravation from you .
<person> does this to me and lives !
everybody looks good in the tropics .
since i haven ' t been able to find <person> since coming back , you ' re going to have to translate for me -- what the hell does that mean ?
well , people got ta get by somehow . that ' s the curse . the mines done it . all that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! everybody ' s got a mother . you don ' t rip up your mother . you don ' t rip up the <person> and take everything out . it ' s like the cracker jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want . `` .
i got things to do . blind man oh well , go do ' em . you don ' t see me stopping you .
you never did answer my question .
still playing ?
architect , yeah . <continued_utterance> no , it ' s not the money . <person> , yeah , that ' s good , but it ' s the freedom i ' m talking about . <person> , this guy has to have a job he could do anywhere . that way we could just up and leave at the drop of a hat .
and where would you and your beer-bellied architect be leaving to ?
<person> is so unattractive .
second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein .
what does that mean ?
and what does that mean ? are you insane ? ! you think i would hurt <person> ? ! she ' s the mother of those kids ! what is wrong with you ?
be warned . i will honor my sworn oath to protect this realm as its gatekeeper . if your return threatens the safety of asgard , <person> will remain closed to you . you ' ll be left to die in the cold wastes of jotunheim .
i have no plans to die today .
did you say it was <person> ?
yes . he came to discuss our friendship . i told him now was not the time .
i miss those days , when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence .
things change . now i ' m taking off my clothes . all by myself . <continued_utterance> well ?
it ' s true . and you know who would agree with me ?
<person> ?
she ' s wearing a ring .
my guess is there isn ' t enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring , but we should do a blowup of this anyway .
i mean she ' s not hating me .
<person> , she ' s been like this all day . i don ' t know . she must have eaten something . she did her business and it was kind of . watery .
mr . concannon . ? <continued_utterance> mr . concannon .
thank you , your honor . we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana , u . s . <number> point <number> and <number> through <number> of the uniform code : ' the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' and , your honor , having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now : we object to the admission of the xerox form .
oh , baby . what a bad boy you are !
thats just what she said . i had a boner with a capital o . i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway . i found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines . she was a wild chick . she was wearin bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides . you know , them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg ?
in my dreams . of course . this is a dream . this is only a dream .
no , ted . this is an actual emergency . <continued_utterance> i tried to warn you , <person> . she ' s got stiletto heels hidden in those keds .
i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me , revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet .
oh . oh , that ' s good .
this is . incredible ! this is astounding ! ! for the first time since menningers i feel free ! i knew coming up here was the right thing to do !
it feels right because you ' re here and because you ' re leaving .
you have given them names ?
yes , sir .
i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> broke-heart of nightingale for our honored guest . <continued_utterance> it is <person> ! the prophecy has come true .
you mean , you know who this baby belongs to ?
i just wan na --
do you know what you ' re doin ' ? just get outta here !
she ' s going to have a baby .
does <person> know ? what have you done to us ?
they ' ve announced the possibility that <person> will delay the release of your new system indefinitely , until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is . i don ' t approve , myself . i don ' t think we should bend one degree to extremists .
<person> for the fanatics ? what does that mean ?
but <person> said .
i know what he said .
you got less than sixty miles today .
what are you going to do with her ?
we might , we ' re on the same train .
no .
you think so ? really ?
they just said that to put us off guard . they saw the condition this apartment ' s in . <continued_utterance> they know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn ' t find it . so that means we ' ve still got it .
he ' s a regular humanitarian . and all this time i thought he was just a tool .
you both could have been a part of it . you could have ridden with us into a new day , the dawning of a new age of --
it ' s a false memory implant . i never saw you before six weeks ago .
why are you lying like this ?
who ? there ' s no one around .
you remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like <person> . and your teacher , <person> said , `` you ' re too late , <person> . there ' s nothing left to explore . `` and all the other kids laughed .
maybe she ' ll change her mind . women do . she might give you a second chance .
i suppose that ' s a possibility . that ' s what i tell my statistics class anyway ; life is a game of chance . endless possibilities and permutations . you just have to calculate the odds .
ok -- can you please stop cursing at me ?
i mean , i realize i ' m in no position to , uh , basically say anything , ever -- but it ' s not like i ' m down there in some redneck bar in florida having an argument with some stripper ' s boyfriend and i suddenly think , `` hey ! maybe this ' d be a good time to really stick it to <person> and get myself locked up for a few months . ``
what about <person> ?
what about him ? i told him i don ' t train with people i don ' t know .
but i don ' t remember .
<person> , it was over a year ago .
. to save her and to save the baby . is that .
yes !
what ?
i ' d go to australia . lot of land , not many people . i think after this i ' d like to quit people for awhile . and the girls go crazy for brothers down there .
it was the parking lot of a strip club .
wherever it was , you can ' t be doing it , alright ? i mean this is a serious -- shit , he ' s here . <continued_utterance> this is a serious problem . <continued_utterance> guy hasn ' t been inside a school since <number> - <number> .
oh , this isn ' t my car . it ' s down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just didn ' t think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
that ' s all right . i got it .
fresno .
we been seein ' you all along the way .
i ' m told . we will move later when we find where the horses are needed most .
yes , sir . perhaps i can keep my brother here with me , he ' s also very good with horses .
what ?
that wasn ' t him . i heard him tell the cops .
who are you ?
it ' s mrs . it ' s <person> . spencer . from next door . is everything --
yeah . <person> destroyed in the <person> wars . what about this independence movement ?
not worth worrying about . mostly descendants of the original colonists from earth . now they want self-rule so they can sell us all the minerals . i don ' t think we ' ve met . you with our group ? takes me a while to know everyone .
will you knock it off ! <person> , man . you ' re going to annoy the iraqis into submission .
this is stupid . it ' s going on a month now . how long are they going to let the air force piss on those bastards ? they can bomb them all they want , <person> ain ' t going anywhere without a ground assault .
sheeni ?
yes , <person> ?
<person> ?
yeah ?
get back in there .
my son is out there !
<person> . got a private jet over at butler aviation . <person> , you always got ta light up when you see me , it ' s the .
<person> ' t start , alright .
come up to the fire , honey .
i think i ' ll just lie down awhile <continued_utterance> long as i live i ' ll never <person> used to that sound .
pardon me . i hate to break up the staff meeting , but they ' re here !
stay calm , everyone ! ! <continued_utterance> uh , meeting adjourned .
it ' s killer . <person> at me -- i ' m not that much to look at . no really . i can be honest . but i got ' em lining up , and not just skanks , either . some are .
so what ' s your angle ?
<person> . <person> . we ' re in deep trouble . the package .
<person> ? what ?
i come up here sometimes when i can ' t sleep . or when i ' m trying to reconcile particle data . or when <person> ' s driving me crazy . <continued_utterance> i come up here a lot , now that i think about it . <continued_utterance> i ' m glad you ' re safe .
you ' ve been very kind . i ' ve been far less grateful than you deserve .
<person> .
came from redfoot .
my friends , i ' ve never been happier to see anyone . but you should not have come .
we ' re here to take you home .
when did you make the switch ?
it ' s always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i ' d better . take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
i swear to you , i mean her no harm .
<person> . if that ' s the case , then i ' ll buy you one more drink , and you ' ll leave town tonight .
i got ta go .
who was that ?
oh yeah ? oh yeah ? then where did i get this ?
something before take-off ?
are you out of your mind ? ?
relax , will you . <continued_utterance> i diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing !
brilliant enough to dupe my entire staff ? i doubt that . <continued_utterance> i ' m giving you back his admitting forms , <person> , to save you any embarrassment .
embarrassment ? !
game ? no . not a game . a weapon . you go back to the trout farm , and in a familiar place , you find a mouldy old wicker basket with a thread-bare canvas cover .
how will we know what to do ?
makes two of us .
i know what i did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much i want that gold .
sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we ' ll know we ' re heading towards saudi arabia . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
look ! <continued_utterance> what do we do ?
i cut it shaving ; i know , i got ta be more careful .
got any requests ?
the ultimate live television . in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .
is it true what you said . on the show tonight ? about letting him go if he wanted it badly enough . would you really do that ?
why me ?
call it penance .
them big-haired blondes are a lot smarter ' n us . . how we gon na pay her ?
you underestimate me , romes .
you ' re learning some discipline and self-control .
and that there ' s a time in life to play it safe .
you don ' t think there ' s some way you could work with me to try and resolve this , do you ?
how so ?
what ?
<person> ' s texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if i want an antique sewing table that we bought together .
what ?
that guy was hurtin ' me . and if you hadn ' t come out when you did , he ' d a hurt me a lot worse . and probably nothin ' woulda happened to him . ' <person> everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night . and they woulda made out like i asked for it . and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now . at least now i ' m havin ' fun . and i ' m not sorry the son of a bitch is dead . i ' m only sorry that it was you that did it and not me . and if i haven ' t , i wan na take this time to thank you , <person> . thank you for savin ' my ass .
toward the end . you remember ?
ohhh yes . no , no . just a little , you know . we ' re fine .
when are the tests ?

i didn ' t take her . she took me .
you lead an exciting life , mr .
where you going ?
my bike . it ' s back over there . we ' ll hang soon . bring your mask if you want . i ' m getting used to it .
did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the law ?
now that you mention it , they might have been a little bit jumpy .
they send us because they want us to change , or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same .
let me tell you something about <person> ' s father , and your ' s too . how do you think you got here ? you think this is all free , that they owe you something ? you think they enjoy riding subways and commuter trains , driving buses or pulling lobster traps ? work fifty weeks a year to keep you in tennis shoes and private school ? look around at how the rest of the world lives <person> . we ' re the luckiest people alive , every one of us . they gave it up for you and <person> , and me too my friend . <continued_utterance> there are ground rules in families just like on this boat . if you and <person> don ' t like it , i ' m sorry . someday you ' ll understand that , and if you ' re lucky , you ' ll come home and find your best friend has been there all along waiting for you to forgive him for being a father . it ' ll be the way it used to be , when you were ten and your dad was a giant . <continued_utterance> does <person> know how you guys feel ?
all i have is a subway card with four stickers .

-because your a thug with a law degree . because i thought by now you ' d be so indebted to this department for not indicting and/or imprisoning you , that diligent , honest discharge of duty would be assured . and i made a horrible misjudgment .

<person> . the professor wants you to come with me right away .
hey <person> , tell <person> what you were telling me last night .
and his face . it seemed so gentle , and i knew . in that second i knew that i ' d imagined the whole thing . <continued_utterance> what ' s happening to me ?
well , that ' s what we ' re here for . <continued_utterance> whether you imagined it or not , you actually saw and heard things that frightened you . that gave you reason for concern .
musketeers .
they are better off disbanded .
and you say he ' s getting serious already ?
yes , i think . he keeps talking about marriage , keeps saying he wants to meet <person> .
well think about it .
no you mean . ?
isn ' t that what we ' re talking about ?
no , i saw you eat the forbidden fruit .
call the police . <person> , that ' s one option .
that is not an `` option . `` there is no multiple choice here .
<person> , what are you doing with <person> ' s car ?
i was as sorry as anyone to hear about mr . <person> ' s passing . wished he coulda ' lived to see this !
station wagon ?
uh huh . want me to lose them ?
she was out of control . she said she was going to kill herself . or you . i never thought she ' d go through with any of it , but then she was gone . he trails off .
she did it .
they did it to pay for my ivy league education .
<person> ? <person> they need these signed by the end of the business day .
<person> , nora . i . um . i . er . lied to you the other day .
how so ?
those are sterile , are they ?
not to worry . they way they set things up , you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection .
this isn ' t a replacement for the real work we ' re doing to get you on your feet again , understand ? no one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor ' s report .
i know , i know .
lonbardo and <person> killed her here .
two kids could ' ve gotten into a fight , lost a couple of teeth .
me neither .
i caught you .
i need your help .
i ' ll call them from the road .
i know . it ' s nuts . and he quit after his freshman year .
why ?
<person> has a flare for the dramatic . the former pittsburgh steeler running back , beat known for `` the immaculate reception , '' his improbable sixty yard <person> . i say <person> has made a bold move on corporate america . <person> has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the <person> sausage company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting <person> ' s , <person> is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .
easy <person> .
these gentlemen made a similar request .
are you refusing to come peaceably ?
well it should be but it ' s not !
just because you ' re nervous about tomorrow , <person> , doesn ' t give you the right to get snippy . if you can ' t handle the pressure , postpone the interview .
it will all be over . i ' ll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life . this will be a great adventure you can look back on .
when will i see you again ?
mary isn ' t well . we decided to stay home with the baby . but why don ' t you come home with me . you haven ' t seen little jaime for a long time .
i can ' t .
would you kill her ? <continued_utterance> because i ' m sick and tired of her little games . because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again . because i ' ve got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her , and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it .
i ' ve done a few things but i ' m not a murderer , mr . mckenna .
you move me , sailor , you really do . you mark me the deepest .
youre perfect for me , too .
pilar . it ' s <person> .
<person> ! <person> mio ! i can ' t believe it ! how are you ?

<person> , a <person> . it was the guy who killed <person> ' s mother .
<person> ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable . a smear on the drafting board .
you ' re not armed . they told me you were my security but you have no weaponry .
who told you that ? i ' m just a marketing trainee . my clinic master thought i ' d learn something about marketing if i moonlighted as a security guard on one of your test previews .
it ' s simple gentlemen , design versatility . a restaurant that can change with taste without losing the overall aesthetic . our atmosphere won ' t be painted on the walls .
this was the part of the proposal that intrigued us , but i ' m not sure i follow .
it ' s <person> .
may i carry your package , <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> .
your father liked shifting . he said it brought him closer to the engine . `` like a woman , purring with ecstasy . ``
i ' m ted , by the way . i think i forgot to say that .
i tried to find you . <person> i got here in time . my dog brought me this .
you didn ' t get here in time . my game is dead .
what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .
thats disgustin . those kinda sentiments should not be allowed out in public . is this <person> yet ?
it ' s a tough planet , boss .
<person> , right .
<person> or <person> chocolate ?
forget it , just the coffee .
it ' s not like i figured . it ' s cold . and it ' s heavier than i imagined .
i wouldn ' t know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
<person> <person> tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own . resources , at first . when <person> ' s ear was delivered to him in the post , he came to me . i advised against paying the ransom . i knew it was <person> . i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him .
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist ?

<person> ' t snap at them !
but he ' s decided to go to <person> too .

<person> away from my sister !
dr . m , you have a fam ! <continued_utterance> you know , i ' m beginning to think you ' re an ingrate .
i see , well this happens to be a nocturne .
a which ?
yeah , mom . why ?
because i say so , <person> . please don ' t think it ' s the way i want it . it ' s just that <person> ' s not himself .
is he <person> i don ' t know , <person> . it seems to me that <person> is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but i know <person> - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . <person> here and let us protect you .
i ' m not bait . no way . i post today .
whatever you ' ve got on your mind isn ' t worth staying awake for .
i think it is .
i thought you said it was a virus ?
a woman can have the same effect .
on whose orders ?
general mcaddie ' s .
tell you what , estelle . i ' ll make out that <person> reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire . it ' ll be less suspicious . but i could take some serious heat for this .
oh , lance ! you ' re wonderful ! how can i possibly repay you ?
you invited me .
only if you are a good man , a friend . are you a friend ?
i ' m stuck . <person> . my life ' s a plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker with a tight pin position on a green with a stimp meter reading of thirteen . i need help . i need advice . i need counsel . i need a shrink .
you don ' t know no shrinks .
huh ? oh , no . this isn ' t <person> ' s . i just write in it .
i guess there ' s probably a story behind that .
she went crazy , <person> .
so did <person> . she ' s in it too .
right on .
so where you headed anyway ?
that was in vietnam .
hes the kind liked it .
make us an offer . i ' m afraid we won ' t be able to use you . we ' ll pay you the half salary for canceling .
oh , no ! are things that bad ?
i ' ve been tellin ' you that for the last ten years .
do you think <person> ' s having an affair ?
<person> , can you figure it out ? a guy bangs into my car , thinks i did him in , tries to get even with me by stealing my wife , you two people fall in love . can you figure that out ?
what ?
andlt ; andlt ; how am <number> you are as stupid as that one , but at least i can talk to you . andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; you ' ll be alright . he is from the f . b . i . he is here to help you . he wants to know what happened in the harbor . andgt ; andgt ;
you can ' t seriously want to play games now . not here . not while we ' re being hunted down by crazy people . _
my baby here took a huge hit in the church , <person> . you see how she ' s quivering ?
i don ' t know . who was that guy that used to talk about <person> in new york ? mcmanus bricks marlin . <continued_utterance> yeah . he said he did jobs for him . indirect stuff . always five times more money than the job was worth .
come on . the guy is a pipe dream . this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
two , three months . maybe less .
so you ' ve given up .
<person> <person> to see dr . <person> .
where are we ?
i ' m not sure what to believe anymore , young lady . you never used to lie to me . but lately you don ' t seem to know the difference between right and wrong . <continued_utterance> <person> , are you listening to me ?
yeah , dad .
<person> hello , sherm .
you wanted to talk ?
i let him think he was courtin ' me , but i reeled him in like a fish on a line . i wanted him . i wanted what he could give me , and i would ' ve done anything to get him . is that love ?
i ' m guessing no .
as long as we use it sparingly , it should last the night . question is , will we ?
what do you mean ?
which way you headed ?
i ' m just goin ' to see <person> at dawson ' s .
then you will give me my baby . my child , born in wedlock , saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear <person> and give him praise .
that ' s why you married us ? so we could conceive our child in wedlock ? the fucking joke ' s on you . i ' m already pregnant . eight weeks yesterday . <person> and ida stare disbelievingly at sheryl .
<person> , remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the ink andamp ; <person> ?
yeah ?
where ? where are they ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! it ' s something they put into your mind at the memory place . fantasies . that ' s their business . <continued_utterance> you ' re a computer operator . you ' re a bore . you ' re a wimp . you ' re not a killer .
i ' m involved somehow with e . i . o . it ' s true . it ' s no fantasy .
what did you find ?
evidence of a massive infection .
<person> .
yes . ?
she did ?
i just saw her .
i slept like a baby after last night . thank you my darling .
august , please . we ' re in public .
<person> .
what can it hurt to talk to someone ? <continued_utterance> please . <continued_utterance> you promised . <continued_utterance> <person> , she ' s been a huge part of your life for seventeen years . if you weren ' t thrown off balance by this , then something would be wrong .
hi .
why ?
she pulled the same thing on us . we lost all our friends in one night -- on account of one tooth !
and just look at my face ! <person> ' s going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks . and what ' ll happen to me if they don ' t want me anymore ?
your real life . the one you came back for .
just sitting here , it feels completely unreal . i ' m sure you knew that would happen .
all i can tell you <person> , is hang in there . they clear you of this mess , you get reinstated , with back pay .
that ' s great . i ' ll just tell my creditors i ' m not a rapist . no problem . <person> . i can ' t believe the board ' s going to act without even hearing my side of it .
i ' m sure the dope was in the diaper . can i go on tailing them ?
forget it . i have solid information your three suspects never had anything to do with the dealers or the dope .
i got ta go .
you weren ' t there , you don ' t know what happened .
no , wait a minute . the fuse box . <person> double-times down the hall .
. <person> ' t you see . ? if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth . nothing could stop it ! nothing !
i ' m not touchy , i just , it ' s a silly question , that ' s all . am i <person> ? are you happy ?
of course , i ' m always happy . unless i ' m bored . that blonde <person> , is that your wife ?
uh-uh . eight letters .
<person> .
can you give me a slap ?
what ?
sometimes we have to improvise . <continued_utterance> <person> ? my <person> ? what ' s happened ?
nothing , he ' s just been sort of , i don ' t know . . kidnapped .
my handwriting is so bad that now i can ' t even read it . you girls better hurry up and graduate from high school so you can take care of me .
we ' ll take care of you .
you frightened me to death ! that bell hasn ' t been used for three months !
get this area policed up . no telling who might be dropping in .
<person> , how does this play out ?
your first step , sir , will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within <number> to <number> hours . they will refuse . when they do , you will order the strikes , followed by the invasion . they will resist , but will be overrun . they will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world , most likely <person> . we will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there , defeating them per our plans .
yes . yes . i think so . i hope you ' ll be comfortable . i ' m putting you up at my .
. i made a reservation at .
that stalker <person> got to you , right ? you ' re working for him , aren ' t you , you little shit ?
who ?
sure . if you go back home to the city , they ' ll probably be waiting for you .
they ?
my goodness , a word with four syllables . i should get some ice before your brain gets too hot .
sure . just chisel some off your heart .
take some pills , will you ?
i ' ll give you a grand to locate and tail <person> .
perfect timing !
<person> planned it for <person> day just to tick me off .
that don ' t mean nothing . iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we ' re in the clear .
you want to crawl , crawl .
a magician makes magic . any fool can use it .
then you get us out of here .
i feel like i ' m being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
eventually you ' ll let go .
i ' <number> take my chances , thank you . it ' s tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop .
where are you going to go , <person> ? you gon na run ? turn states evidence . you might never see trial . if somebody wants to get you , you know they ' ll get you out there .
what are you going to do ?
i don ' t know .
i don ' t like this forest ! it ' s -- it ' s dark and creepy !
of course , i don ' t know , but i think it ' ll get darker before it gets lighter .
what did you say ?
you ' re not a team player .
-- the nanny --
was she the nanny ? i forgot that . how ironic . then there was the ice skater --
the prom -- you going ?
oh , i don ' t know . i think proms are pretty dumb .
of course i do . your problems don ' t go away just because i go on vacation . they ' ve been with you a long time after all .
ever since i can remember .
we ' re off tomorrow .
i think this place may be a little too large for us .
<person> , i ' m freaked out . it worked . so just tell me right now - where is <person> ?
i am <person> .
ok , i ' m sorry !
i don ' t want you to be sorry , i just want you to stop it !
how long have they been stationed there ?
says here about eight weeks .

<person> .
it ' s not a joke .
you ' re right . it ' s not a joke . <person> , i know a little about the amish . i know this has to be an ordeal for you ; and i ' m really sorry you an <person> got involved . <continued_utterance> what was that ?
so , does `` this guy '' have a tip for an honest lawyer ?
<person> , check out <person> , it ' s still not over .
this will give you plenty to digest while i ' m on vacation .

<person> to bother you in a meeting , but you have to promise me that you ' ll be home at eight . i don ' t want <person> and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year .
<person> love wonderful ? .
whats that ?
hey .
where ' d you get the hat ?
to tell you the truth . i ' m excited .

i ' ve never even met you .
i know . and i ' m sorry . i ' ve been consumed with . my daughter left . for school .
some babies are allergic to milk .
so what ' s the stuff that no babies are allergic to ?
did you send in all of the deposit checks ?
i think so .
<person> maid . <continued_utterance> <person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> , what are you doing ?

bishop to knight four .
<person> little son of a bitch . you ' re starting to lose it , aren ' t you ?
you got it , a great spender of other people ' s money .
well , if you ' re that good , you could probably do wonders at my place .
come off it , <person> . i ' m late for work .
what did you say ? <continued_utterance> shelly , i am not fooling around anymore . the first thing you ' ve got to work on is a good attitude . that ' s the key . <person> will tell you that . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t even _think_ about going anywhere , shelly . i ' m not finished with you . he answers the phone . <continued_utterance> what are you doing calling me here ? . no way , you already owe me money . five thousand , to be exact .
unless it says not to , you can set up where you like . just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire . oh , and this here ' s bear country . they ' re not animals to fool with . you see one , you head the other way , especially if he ' s feeding . if the bear thinks you ' re getting in the way of his food , that ' s all she wrote .
<person> .
fortuitous even .

as i recall , i was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape .
ah , the devil you know .
excuse me ?
i don ' t remember .
my parents don ' t do it anymore .
did he know this guy personally ?
no . he was just passing through , asked if he could stay over , and <person> <person> said ' sure thing . ' it doesn ' t make any sense . he invites a strange colored guy in . invited him in to stay . is that crazy or what ? if a colored guy came to my door and said ' can i stay the night , ' i ' d tell him ' get the fuck out of here ' ! it ' s nothing personal , mind you .
<person> , come on . that man is obviously your father . you look just like him .
there ' s a reason for that .
<person> and <person> come by earlier .
and <person> too , i hear .
<person> , oh man .
<person> , oh man , oh man .
<person> is in one half-hour ! come in and change , children !
up ! up , chicks ! you heard your mother !
i wouldnandiacute ; t really have let you die , you know . i just needed .

i can see just fine . for example : you ' re a young man who thinks he ' s got someplace to be . a police radio crackles , <person> tensing .
maybe i do .
what ' d you pay for him ? <continued_utterance> how much , <person> ?
i won ' t tell you a lie - though i would love to . <person> guineas .

how did you get your hand out ?
<person> .
<person> ? !
he ' s not at <person> ' s .

she must have done something with the child . widen the search !
`` . try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese '' . ' <person> burger ' by the vandals .

i can ' t guarantee that .
<person> i ever saw ? <person> tin man i ever saw ? <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> . those guys had good lines , but they burned themselves out too fast . <person> ? <person> ' s the best . the best there ever was . if he ' s in the door , he ' s got a sale . the best closer ever .
what ' s some of the hustles he used to pull ?
<person> ?
what ?
it ' s just that . it ' s been sixteen years since anyone but <person> did that , i --
relax . there , that ' s better . let yourself slip into the role . <continued_utterance> there you go . that ' s right .
<person> happened to <person> ?
i told you , her family moved to miami .
<person> . <person> .
is that all you have ?
upstairs . resting . i can ' t understand why he ' d attack you like that .
i can ' t either . but one thing i ' ve learned about psychiatrists : they ' re brilliant manipulators . i trust your dad completely . i ' m sure everything he ' s done has been to help me . how come you aren ' t making a move on <person> ?
he hid them but i found them . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
yeah ?
<person> . thank you .
<person> .
i won ' t appear in uniform !
please , <person> .
morning sheriff . got my drapes .
well it ' s about time . looks like you found yourself a helper too . <person> wants to shrink behind the drapes .
the <person> was a symptom .

and i ' m glad you got your sense of humor back . think you ' ll keep it ?
only time will tell . <continued_utterance> pretty good cigar . where ' d you get it ?
do you know what you ' re doin ' ? just get outta here !
you know what , man ? you ' re still a fuckin ' asshole .
i almost forgot , here ' s your newspaper . see ya .
<person> ' t that <person> ? there is another knock on the door . it ' s <person> .
you ' re right .
actually , i saw the greenhouse . so i thought . i thought i ' d come out here and take a look at it . you don ' t see one of those every day . it looks like heaven .
mr . president , the motto i chose for sac is ' <person> is our profession . ' <person> forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange . but if launched , those missiles in cuba would kill a lot of americans . that ' s why i ' m being such a pain in the ass about destroying them . destroying them immediately . <person> , even mac agrees .
general , what will the soviets do when we attack ?
like fire .
what ?
i meant no disrespect .
all right , then no more smashing , deal ?
what song ?
`` you send me . ``
yeah , it ' s time for her bottle -- it ' s all ready in the bag .
i ' ll go heat up some water right away . would you like a cup of coffee ?
i said `` <person> , wrong room '' and walked away .
did you shut the door at least ?
so what does he want ?
what does he want ? he wants revenge .
this whole time , you ' ve kept your head . you didn ' t go money simple like me and <person> . you ' ve just been trying to figure how to get us out of here . and you ' ve been fair too . i mean , even after i . you know .
threatened to blow my brains out ?
i ' m going to show you how to wash this tile and then you ' re going to do it .
come off it , <person> . i ' m late for work .
what does that mean , mr . <person> ?
you know what i do , <person> ? i pick certain houses that are strategically located , we put up the aluminum siding , and for every referral , for every person who sees this quality job that we do . sees how beautiful it is . i give you two hundred dollars .
he said there ' s no precedent for this . you ' ll be back by next semester .
next semester ? <continued_utterance> look , tess . they have these smoker fights all over . there ' s one in lancaster next week . there ' s two in dover the week after . <person> . <person> . <person> . it could keep us afloat .
i already know it , <person> .
how ' d you know that ?
<person> down . i can ' t make heads or tails of what you ' re saying .
he ' s coming . he ' s right behind me .
but the good witch of the north told me not to .
<person> well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him !
what should i do with this ?
throw it on the fire with everything else .
<person> .
you ' re surprised . certainly you ' ve been expecting some response to your indiscretion . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite sure whatever you told <person> , you have your good reason . it ' s a weakness in men our age ; the urge to confess . i forgive you that .
who ' s she ?
<person> .
<person> , what ' re you gon na do with that gun ?
i ' m gon na save them , of course . you go for help . <person> at the terminal bar . she ' ll know what to do .
i can ' t believe it took us so long to finally get together ! what exactly do you do for the government ?
you might say . ' public relations . '
not from forty feet . <continued_utterance> the disposable lighter also contains a small self-detonation charge depending on who - or what - you wish to dispose of . <continued_utterance> stop fidgeting , <number> . <person> - he takes out a pair of shoelaces .
. shoelaces ?
you didn ' t hunt today .
yes , <person> . <person> observant . i was indisposed . got that intestinal thing that ' s been going around .
your majesty , that document is an obvious forgery . i am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three musketeers .
this is a complicated matter , <person> , affecting both france and the crown . <continued_utterance> and so , until such time as i and my advisors -- -- can determine the whole truth of the matter . i invite you to await our decision in the comfort of . the bastille .
it ' s weird , <person> , but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework .
i can see this stunt really has liberated your mind .
and presumed what ?
i could give a shit . i just want to this case to get a quick burial .
a medicine man ?
those are white words , not ours .
that you put a murderer on my trail ?
well yeah , i didn ' t know much about him . i just thought --
what do you mean ?
you killed one of the cardinal ' s guards . an offense punishable by death .
he ' s coming in on foot .
that ' s right , <person> . i guess you ' re saying there ' s an awful lot of trails for us to cover .
<person> that work ?
i don ' t know . there ' s two different opinions on this one .
and you must be <person> . <person> , darling , johnny <person> . the deadliest pistoleer since <person> , they say . what do you think , darling ? should i hate him ?
you don ' t even know him .
<person> ' s the same , <person> . <continued_utterance> i had to go look for this coupon .
the one you bought at school .
what ' s with you people ? why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time ? i came through , man .
get up out of the chair , and walk toward the backdoor , <person> .
i ' m in a mess today , too . i ' m thinking about doing it with <person> .
<person> , you are such a crack up . you don ' t even like <person> . is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight .
<person> , that ' s got to be pretty vexing .
for my sin the ground is cursed . thorns and thistles does it sprout for us , and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives . for as the lord has commanded , by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken . for dust you are , and to dust shall you return .
probably the army jacket . those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .
you thought he was carrying a knife ?
kind of a mean place to be . <person> cold , unfriendly .
excuse me . <continued_utterance> <person> ? . <continued_utterance> . no , i just got in . i don ' t know if i can . <person> , i can ' t talk now . can i call you back ? . <person> . <person> . she hangs up the phone , stands and turns back toward the door . <person> is standing right behind her .
because we ' re in this room on december <number> st , <number> , while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away . this room , or even this house , may no longer exist a hundred years from now . but the time machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey . <continued_utterance> you must remember that the space you ' ve just put your hand through is today ' s space . you can ' t put your hand into the space of tomorrow . dr . hillyer space is space ! it doesn ' t change ! the same space that is here now should be here a hundred or even a thousand years from now . <continued_utterance> no ! time changes space . this flat ground we ' re standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago . and a million years from now it could be the interior of a huge mountain .
suppose what you say is true . exactly what do you suggest we do with such a contraption ?
what ?
at the seven-eleven .
<person> . <person> ' s go rescue him .
<person> idea . <person> . only one problem . i don ' t know where they live .
<person> , <person> . four , nice , deep ones . <continued_utterance> anyone stops us going in , we ' re with the bowen-hamilton textile company . we have rug samples .
rug samples .

<person> .
get up out of the chair , <person> .
what ' s with you people ? why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time ? i came through , man .
youandiacute ; re not the only one with gifts .
what am i doing here ?
the point of what ?
this . this whole god damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of
<person> ' t ever call me stupid .
come on , he didn ' t mean anything .
stop it ! stop it , <person> , or i ' ll leave right now . i ' m not kiddin ' !
<person> , alright . i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> can i just ask you one other thing ?
no .
what if you worked out everyday for six months ? you think you could beat him then ?
i don ' t know . work . <person> .
is it that bad ?
for <person> ' s sake , i ' m even a failure in my own book ! can you believe it ? in chapter <number> , i wrote that a healthy adolescent girl can never have a sublimated father complex and my daughter has one .
it ' s a brief flirtation , honey . <person> ' s perfectly healthy .
i ' ll take a ride .
go for it .
i don ' t care if there ' s a lump of coal in here . i just want to be able to rub <person> ' face in it when i crack this thing . <person> watches <person> work the box for a beat .
<person> ?
i was defending myself . he was stealing from me .
it doesn ' t sound like defense to me .
i ' m impressed . <person> . i need transportation to the . uh . the sphinx .
i ' m sorry , sir . but earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely . no one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles . <continued_utterance> oh . do you want the item you left with us ?
<person> ' s got him caught in an iron vice , squeezing for all it ' s worth and trying to choke the teacher out . <continued_utterance> he just launched <person> ! can you believe this ? <person> just shook off a guillotine ! <continued_utterance> <person> ' s staying after him ! he ' s squeezing him ! the tables have turned , and the boy scout is squeezing the bear !
<person> standing and trading with the russian ! i ' ve never seen this !
say , <person> , is ail that stuff true about <person> ? how he used to put coke on his dick . to make himself , you know , like , last longer ?
christ , <person> . how the hell should i know ?
i ' d been told as much .

hey . you got ta smell in this room of puke . you been pukin in here , little girl ? <person> ? . you sick ? .
you used the toilet , now you can go - what i do around here aint any of your business , thats for sure .
this wasn ' t my idea .
i ' m sorry ?
you were arrested because the guardia are clowns who specialize in excess . you were released because i told them to release you .
these are not the normal duties of a businessman .
what killed them i won ' t even write about . i tell you , they ' d do more than just harass me . they have the future to protect .
i ' ll know soon enough .
i ' ll hold them off for as long as i can . go on without me .
i can ' t leave you here . not like this .

bout fifty thousand times . i got us a room at the cape fear , and guess what ? . i hear powermads at the hurricane .
all in all i guess it ' ll all work out for the best .
i ' m glad you feel that way .
here they come ! get ready .
oh , no .
what ' s your feeling about <person> ?
i don ' t really know him that well .
conlon . <person> ' s conlon . and anything you want to know about <person> , you got ta ask him yourself .
i ' m just looking for some general information here .
oh , well , i didn ' t really have a concrete plan yet . i have to go back to <person> and get my stuff .
oh , are you gon na try to see that girl ?
oh , right . <person> . your daughter ' s . kidney ?
<person> .

she was . how did you know that ?
you mean they ' re all gone ?
yeah , all of ' em , hey , can you make a little room for me to .

what ' re you talking about ? we have that .
<person> ' s phone . her office line and the line at my house .
i like to editorialize . you drunk ?
drunk ? only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of fianga as the first army of liberation marched in and opened fire .
dr . <person> ' s not in .
i had an appointment at his office , i think i must have got it wrong . we had a meeting .
sylvia -- she wanted to know how <person> was doing .
what ? <person> , <person> , why didn ' t you let me talk to her ! ?
twisp residence .
<person> ?
you should have heard her play .

i was like a different person tonight .
you were the new and improved you .
god . the law is some tricky shit , isn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> how do you know ' bout all this stuff anyway ?
besides , what do we say about the robbery ? no excuse for that . no such thing as justifiable robbery .
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you weren ' t saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
some people grow up and change their ways .
i think so .
you ever shoot par with a seven iron ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> now what ' s this big deal you wanted to discuss ? i shouldn ' t even talk to you after canceling out on my show .
<person> , i saw the old man .
<person> . <person> that winch there . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ?
fuck the winch . i wan na drive .
reroute it , like all the others .
right . can i get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble ? sitwell glares at him . <continued_utterance> it ' d be a nice gesture . <continued_utterance> hold a sec . we got something outside the fence , west side .
thank you .
you ' re homesick .
i felt limited . i felt confined . i felt like i was suffocating .
i see . so more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist .
<person> bubble , i have an idea we ' re going to meet up again sometime .
we might , we ' re on the same train .
so go dance .
with you .
just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee . thirty days or thirty feet . whichever comes first . i ' m in the right .
oh , look . the sailors are here .
demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . i don ' t know where .
<person> is smart enough to know you ' d check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he ' s probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
dividend . i figure i owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes .
. don ' t be crazy . put it to your school loans .
but <person> a robber and a manslaughterer and i havent had any parental guidance .
shes forgiven you of all these things . you love her . <person> be afraid , <person> .
oh really ? what ' s <person> ?
how old ' s your baby ?
then what the fuck did you do it for ?
i did it because because i ' d never stopped thinking about you and if i didn ' t find you i knew my life would never be good again .
so , what did you do ? have some kind of religious experience ?
i tell ya . i took my wife for lunch yesterday . we went and had some smorgasbord , and it kind of happened .
just kills me .
i love you dad .
well ?
well , we should identify ourselves .
i don ' t know . i guess maybe he decided just to hit and run .
so where are his tire tracks ?
later .
they ' re screaming like monsters and it ' s giving me a headache . go get some fucking starbursts .
<person> ' t you tell when somebody ' s hittin ' on you ?
so what if he was ? it ' s all your years of waitin ' tables has made you jaded , that ' s all .
hoped for it .
are you trying to seduce me ?
hey , you ' re right !
' course we ' d still have to worry about <person> ' s <person> and <person> and <person> ' s <person> .
well that certainly was a bust . i want my money back . come , darling , let ' s seek our entertainment elsewhere .
what ' s wrong , <person> ?
make it quick , the punks may be trying to call .
so hurry home , <person> , this little doll can ' t wait to see you . ' bye . <continued_utterance> that goddamn mother fuckin ' jerk of an asshole ! i swear when he comes through the door i ' ll kill him ! i ' ll .
what are you complaining about ? here ' s your fifty bucks .
thirty-five years and all i got to show for it is a ticket punch .
that i ' ll just . that one day i ' ll just . disappear . <person> . <person> ' s taken aback by this admission .
tell me . i can help you .
i see .
finally , your new watch : blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks ; press this button , the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter .
and besides , i ' m so fat .
you ' re not fat --
<person> ' t mind me , <person> , i ' m just a wild woman .
i always knew that .
<person> .
keith do not trivialize this .
but you didn ' t listen . you didn ' t learn anything . all that is left is fear . a blind animal fear . ages ago men were taught to hide in the ground when the sirens blew . taught to run from a raining death . but those men are dead ! and so are the men who slaughtered them . <person> ' t you understand ? you are slaves of a dead past . you don ' t even own your souls . you ' re led to slaughter like sheep ! man in white but there is nothing to fear now , it ' s all clear . <continued_utterance> what about those who went below ?
they never come back . nobody can bring them back .
what about me ?
what are you going to do ? she takes a beat , then puts her game face on .
that ' s really nice of you . now let ' s get that in writing .
never heard of anything so ridiculous . your next performance is tomorrow night , after dinner . be here , or i ' ll sue ! he dignifiedly walks in the direction of some departing guests , and proceeds to show them to the door .
he ' s going back where he belongs . <person> and <person> step out of the police vehicle .
you were right , dr . <person> . <person>ting a lunatic like <person> loose in the real world did pose an unacceptably dangerous risk to the public . i should have never tried to solve one problem by allowing the creation of another . chief <person> will give you a ride back to the station . you will provide him with any and all information you have developed thus far . enjoy the rest of your sentence , mr . <person> . she exits . <person> and <person> stand facing each other . <person> wishes there was something he could do . <person> looks completely out of it . <person> extends his hand . after a moment , <person> takes it .
and the child .
she had it , before she drank herself to death . <person> ' t exactly a love child .
well but -- are you gon na come back to say good-bye ?
no -- i ' m just gon na take off . i ' ll see you later .
now that ' s dry-gulching . <person> ' em in the throat , but do it before they ' re expecting it . now you try .
i ' m afraid i ' ll hurt you .
<person> ? seconal ?
i need peace and quiet !
let ' s go you two . we ' re headed for the mountains .
in a minute .
maybe he got promoted . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t . touch . anything .
this is the life , baby . we get ourselves some tail and we ' re talking spring break !
oh no marlena , i won ' t ever tell .
that ' s the name of the song . `` <person> ' t tell him what happened to me '' . <person> . she ' s one of my favorites . <continued_utterance> are you much of a wine drinker ?
what are you doing ?
looking for a phone book . i want to call a cab . unless you wan na give me a ride ?
<person> , well , if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight , hes a liar . <continued_utterance> so , sailors gettin out soon , and youre gon na see him ?
meetin him at the gate . that phone call this afternoon was the signal . my deranged mamas hid the keys to my car . but of course , i know exactly where they are .
all right .
wow . who saw that coming ?

<person> ' t enough time . <person> was out , what . ? thirty minutes . takes the bastards an hour , maybe two to absorb somebody .
why <person> ?
oh , so i ' m lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion ?
i never said that . i ' m saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys . besides , your brother <person> never gave a shit about you . ted gives him a look . dom you know , you ' re a real glass-is-half-empty guy . you got a fucking guardian angel , man .
yeah . i told her i was coming home .

<person> , you still got it , <person> . who ' s mr . jocularity ?
twinkle lights ?
little white christmas lights that twinkle . i use them in my window and on all my displays , as if you didn ' t notice .
what are you doing ?
my job . back off , benedict . <continued_utterance> the only man i called `` dad '' owns a little grocery store in xenia , ohio . he learned a lot of cool stuff from my <person> , who was a peach farmer in his day . <person> knew the right thing to say in every situation , and it usually involved peaches . my dad ' s a lot like him . and he taught me , you have to focus on the peachy side of life , not the pits . <continued_utterance> there was a time when canned peaches were the hottest , greatest thing ever invented . it was like a little taste of summer , anytime you wanted . grocery stores couldn ' t keep them in stock , they were so popular . and even though other canned fruits like pears , plums , and pineapples have come along , people still need to know they can get their canned peaches , on the same shelf , whenever they want them . it ' s comforting , you know ? it fulfills their expectations . <continued_utterance> you ' re probably wondering if there ' s a point to all this and i guess it ' s just that i goofed last month . i not only moved the canned peaches , i restocked the shelves with kiwi , guava , and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup . i challenged people ' s expectations . and you can ' t do that to your customers . so , i ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches . <continued_utterance> thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .
no , sir . i ' m not going to be around long if that ' s what you ' re worried about .
that ' s a nasty cut you got there .
pow .
you got me .
that guy was hurtin ' me . and if you hadn ' t come out when you did , he ' d a hurt me a lot worse . and probably nothin ' woulda happened to him . ' <person> everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night . and they woulda made out like i asked for it . and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now . at least now i ' m havin ' fun . and i ' m not sorry the son of a bitch is dead . i ' m only sorry that it was you that did it and not me . and if i haven ' t , i wan na take this time to thank you , <person> . thank you for savin ' my ass .
i said all that ?
describe to me your duty , as you understood it , regarding <person> and <person> .
take both men into custody before <person> and the feds could , and find out what they were going to tell-
one way .
<number> . <number> . <person> more will get you back .
i wanted to be your friend .
oh .

i ' m cooking you dinner .
you don ' t have to do that .
what ?
it ' s going to cost you two-hundred dollars .
not much . he knows i don ' t have the highest opinion of him . and he knows i don ' t want to see him or know anything about him , ever . but i tried to keep it kind of neutral . <person> . i could go into a lot more detail , believe me .
well . it ' s an interesting problem . but i don ' t really know what to tell you . it ' s a little outside my personal field of expertise .
not so simple .
you ' re god damn right it ' s not . you take that picture you ' ll take it for all the right reasons -- i understand .
an overheated car .

what ?
liking the place , frank .
thank you , brother . you see this beast ? <person> ?
<person> it out !
i steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !
you can ' t do anything about that . you might fall between that chair and this television . if that ' s what <person> has planned for you , that ' s what ' s going to happen . you can ' t hide from it in your room .
they call me mr . <person> at school . cause i break like glass . <person> ' s face is tense . unyielding . <person> .
<person> .
i ' m finished at three . no . <person> with <person> .
he was my father ' s best friend !
he ' s killed closer .
it ' s not real .
what ' s real to you ? wall street ? capital hill ? now they are myths .
i ' ve never been more popular .
<person> , we need help .
yeah , it is .
so why ' d you move him if he wanted to stay here .
you don ' t understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
<person> ' t surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
<person> . it ' s good to see you two doing so well . <person> looks confused .
i ' m sorry ?

you ' ve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers .

you be careful now , <person> .
he ' s the assistant chief of anesthesiology , <person> . he says your doctors , <person> and <person> , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we don ' t know is why . what went on in there ? in the o . r . that ' s what we ' d like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang . someone got distracted . what ?

ah . well , that ' s ail right . <person> and i ' had a little dinner .
well , certainly we ' ll reimburse you .
where is the ring ?
someone else has it now .
of course not . have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? no you ain ' t . you have to take just one and fatten him up . when you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . if you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . you just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste . <continued_utterance> you just take one ; you thaw out the cold and hunger in his bones from sleeping on the bare ground .
i don ' t know if we could take one in with <person> and me at home alone at times .
oh , hurry -- please hurry ! <continued_utterance> . ty ! <continued_utterance> oh -- oh -- oh ! toto -- toto !

yes , he is . you find his daughter ?
no . that lady is gone and doesn ' t want to be found .
the reactor is secured . <continued_utterance> this is the end .

i have . i did . it ' s done .
yeah , i ' m doing fine . i have so much to tell you . i don ' t even know where to begin .

aaaaaahhhh . <person> . here , i made something for the baby .
they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .
i say to myself , look at the map . look what ' s all around you . people who wish bad bad things for you and your people . for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody . it used to be they ' d throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . then the gunpowder revolution . now they ' re shooting fire power back and forth , all day bullets flying , babies getting shot .

because i know you ' re full of shit .
hi . we were just wondering if we could ask mr . nourish a question , away from all the others .
sure . <person> . <continued_utterance> long as you don ' t ask me to fill in your questionnaire .
you couldn ' t sit on your rump under my daddy ' s roof . no sir . if you couldn ' t outwork his mule , you wasn ' t worth the salt you put in greens . you had to wake up looking for something to do . i was raised as a mule and now i ' m a rolling stone . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean for you to pay me for that .
i know you didn ' t but you have been so thoughtful .
it ' s all right , <person> .
you ruined my life , <person> . me and my wife . and i am going to ruin yours . you don ' t have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years . my wife ' s been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .

what ' s wrong with your wife ? she doesn ' t work ?
yeah , but how much is she gon na make working at the social security office ? <continued_utterance> come on , wing , can ' t you do better than this . a man in my position in terms of this firm . i dunno .
i ' m sorry about all that . i just-i don ' t like to talk about my family . they treat me like a freak .
<person> , come on . that man is obviously your father . you look just like him .
then why in hell ' re you doin ' this ? you ought to be in bed .
<person> is my friend .
i don ' t know . i ' m sort of at a critical . . . juncture .
i thought you were tinkering .
were you now ?
what do you say ?
yeah , a headache . my head hurts . you ' re making me uncomfortable .
i ' m making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that doesn ' t bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
is that what the judge said ?
yeah , that ' s what he said .

well --
i think you should .
i thought i had ' em . i was this close .
the amount of time you spent there , i thought you were ready to send for me to close it up .
<person> ' t sweat it . well . ' <person> , <person> .
oh , <person> ? you know , last semester , what i said that time in office hours-i hope there ' s no hard feelings .
why , how could i not worry ? not knowin whats happenin to you or where you are ? are you with that boy ?
if you mean <person> , mama , yes i am .
i have to get you home by one .
it ' s only <number> : <number> .
. you saw her ?
yes . yes , i have .
agent <person> , f . b . i . how many dead ?
fifteen so far . we ' re still pulling some bodies out of the water . <continued_utterance> looking for anyone in particular ?
so she ' s married ?
nope . never been .
no , apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent .
are you kidding ? she had her flashlight trained on your hindi boner !
<person> ? this <person> lull .
. <person> .
hey .
what ?
this is the best scam i ' ve ever thought of in my whole life . he kisses his hands with wild smacking sounds . he ' s ecstatic . <continued_utterance> it ' s in my blood . i ' m brilliant . i ' m fucking brilliant . this is such a brilliant scam . i ' m beside myself .
what are you talking about ?
no . no .
oh , yes . yes .
this <person> ' s ranch ?
that ' s right . and i ' m <person> .
down there . just down there . a helpless toy . it ' s . it ' s trapped , <person> !
then we ' ve no time to lose ! ! <continued_utterance> i don ' t see anything !
how long does it take for the infection to take hold ?
no time at all .
yes ! no , not really .
the number is <number> - <number> . would you like me to connect you ?
this is all bullshit .
he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead . you saw him die , right ? or did you ? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up . you heard the shot , just before the fire but you didn ' t see him die .
i don ' t owe them a goddamn thing .
then why don ' t you testify ?
<person> ? do you have something to tell me ?
<person> . tell <person> that nothing .
<person> shit !
i know , right ? can you believe that ? !
<person> ' t blame yourself . in your shoes , i don ' t think i would have told <person> , either . so do you think <person> has become the dominant personality ?
i ' m not sure . my guess is that ' s what <person> wants us to think .
and you ' re looking for ? <continued_utterance> i can tell you that without even looking at him . conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris . <continued_utterance> this body has already been autopsied , <person> . you can tell from the way it ' s been wrapped and dressed .
does this fit the description you just read me , <person> ?
it means shut up , thelma .
so this is all my fault , is it .
who ' s the beauty ?
the car .
me too .
<person> is the jersey shore .
i know of him .
how is that ?
<person> ' t get funny with me again .
i ' m not . <person> i ' m gon na need some more stuff . i mean it . i ' m out .
. and then it was all over . <continued_utterance> we haven ' t spoken since .
wow . that ' s too bad . he sounds almost perfect .
what do you want me to do ?
this is humiliating . we ' re being ejected from a prom !
take it easy , <person> . we ' ll handle mr .
<person> ? fine . get a hold of <person> , i ' d be more than glad to talk to him .
it stays as it is . we ' re halfway home now . <person> ' s not blow it by people getting ideas .
you ' re the one with all the ideas .
is that who knocked you out ?
<person> knocked me out .
<person> ?
<person> , are you my best friend ?
we don ' t want anyone else to know .
please don ' t mention it . for heaven ' s sake !
<person> , i beg of you . the american army is there . i am iraqi . they will kill me .
<person> ' s going to hurt you . <continued_utterance> you see that ? gold . you take us to the americans , and we ' ll give you another one . now drive .
what is this ? what is going on ?
mr . <person> ?
hi .
hey .
and you ' ve never seen anything like that ?
no . it didn ' t show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
so , why did you take me up there ? <continued_utterance> it ' s warm .
<person> , fall semester , first day of class , it was <number> degrees and you were wearing the coat . <person> just blinks , no ready answer-available . <continued_utterance> that ' s why they all give you such a hard time in workshop .
no . time traveller then where does this come from ? <continued_utterance> it grows . it always grows .
but it must be planted , cultivated , nurtured . unless . unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation .
hi ! <person> ' a little shopping , huh ? how ' s your place -- not too much damage , i hope .
what do you guys want ?
maybe we could wait around a little longer , sir . there is a long pause before skipper answers .
<person> on .
<person> ' s always going to be a losing financial proposition , but it doesn ' t mean you shouldn ' t buy the place .
i am buying it . make no mistake about that .
well , then what are you doing here ?
i . do you want me to leave ?
you mean flat ?
that ' s the same as even .
some kind of mutation . ?
<person> ' t touch , don ' t touch .
it ' s always been like that . when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured i ' d better . take precautions . i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
but .
then shoot them also .
<person> - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field .
so what ' s our plan , our scenario , our modus operandi ?
we can ' t do anything till it ' s dark .
i wan na book a flight to australia .
where exactly ?
too often . <continued_utterance> too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men . <continued_utterance> so that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside . without expression .
his is a mistake .
once .
how was i ?
my mind plays tricks on me . is it okay if i take a bath now ?
everyone is gone . <person> is in the bathroom .
why ?

but , in particular ?
i am !
how ' bout <person> ?
what made you pull out that old thing ?
i was thinking of you .
what ? !
from the moment i first saw you i knew i was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks , and when you started talking i was smitten and i ' m smitten more every day i think about you -- and the fact that you know i ' m full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually i can bullshit people but i can ' t bullshit you and in addition , most women i ' m thinking about how to get into their pants from day one but with you i ' m just thinking about how to get into your heart -- molly was clue-less . she just stares .
i have bad news for you .
no . ! <continued_utterance> great . what are we supposed to do now ?
would you like to stay the night , <person> ? we can reminisce of our departed .

no thank you , mr . <person> .
it makes sense to you ? you ' re not surprised ?
i hear things . it ' s hard to surprise me . <continued_utterance> and what else ?
that ' s <person> .
and just who the hell is <person> ?
you better be a cop , pal !
my badge is in my jacket . <person> pocket .

well be alright , peanut , long as weve got room to move .

hey , vince . congratulations . you know <person> .
how are you ?
this is the one . my glasses are in my room . i ' d like to read it by myself , but i ' m a little anxious . read it , son . slowly .
<person> : why , you dirty , old -
<person> , because nobody else was there . you ' re lucky i was walking by . <continued_utterance> <person> , it ' s possible i dreamed that -- but who practically raised you after your father was dragged off by those raccoons ? not a dignified death .
he was a small man . oh collapses face down in the sand .
<person> . yes . the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records .
what ?
thanks for taking care of him . i will try not to be so long next time .
what time is it ? do you think you can just treat us like your slave ?
love letter ?
that ' s my business .
i was just waiting for the right time .
and you didn ' t feel like you could trust my wife with this news ?
<person> , that ' s not nice . i ' m in church now .
why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone ? i remember when you weren ' t saved . that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road .
i am beautiful , aren ' t i ?
of course you are .
<person> what , i ' m an opium fiend ? no , <person> , i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night .
<person> , <person> , i know you ' re-
i ' ve got nothing to say about anything or anybody .
<person> , lady , i can be back in thirty minutes with a search warrant and a handful of cops , and i can probably have you arrested , whether or not the charges would stick . now do you want to let me in and talk ?
we don ' t want to push her away . these are growing experiences .
how long have you known about this ? <continued_utterance> how long have you known ?
yes , we do , <person> ! we do . it makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation . he ' s just a kid .
i know . i know . you ' re right .
why not ?
because i guarantee she ' s married and has a couple kids . girls like <person> don ' t stay single .
twice .
is that what you were trained to do ?
sucks . so what ' s up ? you some kind of salesman or something ?
nah . i ' m . i ' m nothing .

your roommate won ' t mind ?
you aint takin <person> , though .
course i am , mama .
i ' ve read official estimates but i wouldn ' t bet my house on them . i ' ve heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers . at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who don ' t give a damn if they ' re caught or not .
what do you look for ?
come on , kiddo . i ' ve been there . i ' ve done it . i ' ve seen it . you can trust me . i ' ll understand .

i don ' t know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i ' m in so far , they ' d kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i ' m like you said , a criminal .
welcome to columbia inn . how do you do ?
how do you do ?
i guess i am at that . <person> ?
why not ? <continued_utterance> by the way , <person> , you were right about your wife . she ' s a good lady . i ' m glad you got her back .

what key ?
um , i ' m the only boy that drives in the village . no one else drives but me .

i told you , most nights i sit on the stool and grade papers , but every now and then i need some action .

<person> , mr . <person> . you have a drug problem , all right ? on top of that , you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected . we pumped you with antibiotics so you ' ll be fine , but another day or two and you might have lost the foot . as for your spells . i ' m guessing they ' re a result of the anxiety you ' ve been experiencing lately .
they ' re anxiety attacks ? that ' s a little disappointing .
i don ' t know that anything could have prevented what happened .
then what are you trying to say then ?
<person> , no thanks .
<person> , i know you get approached a lot by dubious men , but i ' m different , i never talk to strangers , all my life i ' ve been waiting for the right person to walk across the room . you ' re that person , you don ' t know it but i do and if you walk away now i ' ll never see you again or you me . you ' ll grow old .

the members of this tribunal have reached a verdict . based on the evidence presented we find the defended guilty as charged of desertion , insurrection , insubordination , and conduct unbecoming . further the tribunal will recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment , and that from this day forward he shall no longer walk as a free man . you should consider yourself quite fortunate , son . there was a time when lesser crimes would have found you before a firing squad . i don ' t know that a person like you has much to say for himself , but it is your right say something .
i ' m sorry , i guess . not for looking for the gold , or leaving my post . you know what it ' s like to have gold raining out of your hands ? that ' ll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig . i ' m just sorry about <person> . he was all right . it was the gold that made him what he became . if i hadn ' t found that map , if i hadn ' t talked them into going searching . <person> just might have made it home after all . i guess i feel responsible for him .

excuse me sir .

you don ' t know what you ' re talking about ! there was nothing else i could do ! i can ' t explain it better than that , but you can ' t go on like this because you don ' t know anything about it and you don ' t know what you ' re doing !

federal bureau of investigation , <person> .
well , little fella , we don ' t need any outside help here . i don ' t like you people sniffin ' around my neck of the woods . in fact , when the state boys called me about a `` j . <person> '' coming up i think i said , `` so what ? ''
it ' s no go .
well , get to somebody . anybody . we ' ve got to report this mess .
of course you are . <continued_utterance> iandiacute ; m sorry to come here , ms . <person> . i was afraid if i went to a hospital , they would .

i ' m sorry , <person> . i know you ' re all upset . it ' s just i ' m so excited to be out of the house , i guess . i wonder if <person> ' s home yet .

i mean since then .
what ' s that got to do with the radiator hose ?
i don ' t know , but `` it ' s the reason i ' m living here and you ' re just passing through . `` now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars .
that thought makes me feel awful .
<person> ' t you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . <person> ' t you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?
i just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .
<person> . i never get into bed with somebody unless i know for sure . just the way i was raised .
excuse me , monsieur . but not until one o ' clock .

i ' ll call you . in two hours .
no . i was sent here cuz i ' m indian . and a good cop .
you ever think that maybe you was sent here cuz the fbi ' s need one good reason to take out the entire warrior movement . and what better reason than one of their men , gettin ' blown away on the res . a low-rent , expendable public servant sent in to take a bullet for his country .
and we can ' t purge the chiefs . our invasion talk will look like a bluff . or even that there ' s been an attempted coup .
mcnamara won ' t be able to handle them . it ' s too much for one man . . with all due respect to our heroic fifth column .
watch it !
ahhh ! <continued_utterance> i hate this .
l-just want to say i ' m sorry .
she ' s in philadelphia seeing <person> . the neurologist .
<person> up .
<person> <number> .

them big-haired blondes are a lot smarter ' n us . . how we gon na pay her ?
nothing , it ' s just that , , well , it ' s been awhile since arsonist ' s <person> , and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were .
washed up ?
yeah . like you ' d know .
and what ' s that ?
i won ' t !
did you know my <person> used to take me and <person> out at night to look at the constellations ?
he talks loud . and he loves his code .
i see . he does talk loud .
oh , dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable . <person> ' t you get down ?

its a mistake , honey . you two go on .
<person> herbs . <person> . <person> ' t worry , we don ' t smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe . that ' s a white man ' s myth . this is a sacrament .
<person> .
busy . but you ' ve got his heart .
i want an hour with him .
kinda looks like you .
`` terminator '' climbing claws . <continued_utterance> miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .
just say it , dad .
i know they were simple people , but did this trip help your college fund at all ?
that ' s true . we could be stuck here for hours . could be like this all the way to <person> .
what the hell are you doing ?
come on , <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , whoa . <person> , now , easy now , <person> . <person> , whoa , whoa .
<person> ! it ' s hopeless - we can ' t help them .
<person> ?
there ' s got to be some new variable . or an equipment malfunction .
<person> was catholic ?
yeah . so am i .
any sign of him ?
not yet .
where ' d you learn to do that ?
from my father . he was the tribe ' s shaman .
<person> tempting . i prefer mine with a twist of fate . you know like us meeting . <person> ' t go away .
what do you want ?
delightful . we read , we knit sweaters , and we train our rats to perform circus tricks .
well , if ever you need any more rats , we can always send ours over . `cause we ' ve more than we need , strictly speaking . besides , they scare off all the pretty girls .
excuse me . . . sir ? !
force comm cleared you to give us total cooperation , right ?
no jeremy .
what if he wasn ' t aloud to kick and you were really mad at him ?
i know .
doesnandiacute ; t it ever wake you in the middle of the night ? the feeling that some day , some day very soon , they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children ? take you all away ?
<person> down ?
you must overcome your fears and regain control . <person> hold of your life again . it ' s as easy as holding that glass . what if i told you that you can take control of all of this . everything . even me .
well , you didn ' t have to go and hit me , did you ? is my nose bleeding ?
well , of course not . my goodness , what a fuss you ' re making . well , naturally , when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why , you ' re nothing but a great big coward !
i thought you were born grown up .
you ' re masking hostility , <person> . <person> that down .
it ' s all right to be nervous .
why does everyone keep saying that ?
did anyone ever die next to you in combat ?
yeah .
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindus lifetime to unfix . you better get a move on , <person> , before that boy got her holdin down a memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms .
really , <person> , you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than <person> got pills . <person> to take it easy . go over to <person> for a few days .
<person> good . so you ' re human .
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
i didn ' t `` scopata '' anybody !
who is . <continued_utterance> <person> ? <continued_utterance> i catch you , right ?
so how did you get here ?
bus .
that ' s just the way he was in the army . always thinking of the other fellow .
we ate and then he ate . we slept , and then he slept .
there was nothing . i swear .
what did he give you ?
oh , i missed you !
me , too .
right . well , thanks . for the lift .
no sweat . only do me a favor ?
what ? tell me .
they ' ve announced the possibility that <person> will delay the release of your new system indefinitely , until they can determine how widespread support for this fanatical group really is . i don ' t approve , myself . i don ' t think we should bend one degree to extremists .
. a demonstration of some kind ?
because if more of you . were like more of us . like more of us .
we ' re kidding ourselves .
<person> well . load your guns .
we can ' t just sit here . we ' ve got to start moving , so pick .
you sure you want me too ? <continued_utterance> i pick that way .
hundred seventy-five a week , take home .
bullshitter !
sure . though , you know there is another way to look at it .
what ' s that ?
that ' s going to do it , right ? i ' m going to be okay .
you ' re going to be fine .
things still going around ?
now they ' re going sideways ! <continued_utterance> now they ' re going in and out !
now stop right there . that ' s <person> . she don ' t talk to nobody and you don ' t talk to her . and don ' t mention her to august . <person> ' t no right way to talk about somebody ' s wife and make it sound like a compliment .
<person> ?
mulder -- it ' s me --
where are you , <person> ?
what ? that ' s just <person> ' s bad taste .
why couldn ' t he have just told you all these things ?
<person> . you ' re hammered . what are you doing ?
you ' re right about the old man . his power ' s long dried up . he ' s supposed to be a medicine man but he won ' t go see the people . he says we changed , and we don ' t listen . well , he don ' t go out and talk no more . i haven ' t had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar , and this <person> is gettin ' watered .
what ' s all this ?
<person> ' , boss . just old smokies . <person>nly place they can come for a puff . it ' s all banned topside .
perhaps he is not all he says he is .
<person> nice . i ' m impressed .
oh . how was <person> ?
bloody .
. i ' m positive this time .
. please stop .
you got a great set-up here <person> . you really know how to live .
it ' s a beautiful town , prague . it ' s been good to me .
i . i ' m totally . i don ' t know what to say .
well , you could always say `` yes . `` or you could think about it first .
<person> . i never get into bed with somebody unless i know for sure . just the way i was raised .
<person> . <person> .
was there an argument ?
not that i know of . but arguments do happen , don ' t they ?
for the good of the people .
for the good of everyone who enjoys the favor of the throne .
you ' re gon na put yourself through this over and over , for five hundred bucks a pop ?
some of them pay a little more than that . <continued_utterance> i would have had to bounce for a month to make what i made in two hours last night . <continued_utterance> and these guys , they ' re not real fighters . they ' re just guys who have seen too much ufc on tv . if you have a better solution , i ' m all ears .
-- and then we see each other twice and you suddenly say you want to get married ? i mean .
no , you ' re right , you ' re right --
- built to withstand a nuclear blast . are they alive ?
yes . shall we kill them ?
how would you know ?
why are you like this ? because bond is dead ? it ' s what you wanted .
who ' s listening ? it ' s just one college buddy talking to another .
<person> , right .
i ' m his guardian .
what ' s that mean ?
i don ' t think we have anything to talk about .
what about us ?
i received a card from your store .
congratulations , you have a mailbox . the sale isn ' t for two weeks .
ouch ! !
<person> !
i hate this .
<person> ' s gon na take your baby . know why ? <person> cares . except me . you wan na go back to your farm . you wan na go back to your family . i could take care of that baby . i ' ll look after her like she was me own .
you ' ve got ta be kidding ?
but , they don ' t speak english .
yes . just like benny the dog . your face and body can now be fixed , of course . but it ' s very different out there now . your finances won ' t last long . your panel of observers are waiting for you to choose . <continued_utterance> there are no guarantees . but remember , even in the future , the sweet is never as sweet without the sour .
how do i wake up ?
that would be wonderful , but it ' s only been a year since <person> died .
what are you afraid of ? what people think ?
march , <number> . we torched a village and the government made a big deal out of it . <continued_utterance> you was on a ship , pardner . <person> to make contact with the people when youre off floatin in the gulf of tonkin .
hey <person>by , have yourself another glass a jack .
under arrest ? no , i ' m the officer working the case of his stolen car .
ah .
by `` appropriate '' you mean `` steal ? ''
this should more than compensate you for your trouble .
and he had a younger brother who . . . was . . . a . . .
<person> . <person> . and his mother blames <person> for his death .
-give the man a prize . he ' d also rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn ' t convict . now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip .
<person> . <continued_utterance> loaded him into a car-
no , thelma , i don ' t give a shit what we have for dinner . i may not even make it home for dinner . you know how fridays are .
<person> how so many people wan na buy carpet on a friday night . you ' d almost think they ' s want to forget about it for the weekend .
<person> , okay .
<person> . now hit a seven iron into that tree over there . you ' re ready .
thank you for seeing me .
that ' s perfectly all right .
i don ' t know what you did to him , or said to him , or what . but he ' s really pissed off at you ! what did you do ?
it ' s what i didn ' t do .
should have at least gotten the map off of him . <person> up with him then we did all this for nothing .
<person> ?
as god is my witness , i have never done anything to that woman .
you must have done something to her .
no , you don ' t understand , we ' ve been married for <number> years --
look , <person> , this is just some whacko hooker i met in the bar .
what you seek -- it ' s a bridge .
a bridge ? like an einstein-rosen bridge ?
he was alive , y ' see , sir , where nothing survives , so to me and me mates , to the men , sir , he ' s - well , we have high hopes for him -
you should shoot him now .
allegra , we ' re back home . what ' s the matter , what ' s wrong ?
pikul . it ' s here , it ' s happened . it ' s come back here with us . we brought it back with us from existenz .
i think i forgot the tent .

i ' d like to discuss this with my client , mr . <person> .
what ' s to discuss ? i ' m not taking care of him if i ' m not getting anything for it .
<person> . <person> pounds . <person> pounds . <continued_utterance> fifteen pounds .
<person> .

<person> , how come you know the words ?
honey that song came out in <number> , when i was exactly your age .
no . not really .
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house .
thanks for picking me up .
no prob , i could use the company . i ' ve been on the road going on fifteen hours straight .
this is <person> . this one is <person> . and this one is done by me . it is a snowboard .
well , two of them are geniuses .
uh uh . not me , daddy , i just reported it . it was the kid .
what kid ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> nothing ' s going to happen to you .
i don ' t know that .
i ' m taking her .
what ?
we got two right here .
there ' s one . i think one .
he ' s a great chef .
he ' s weird . and i expect more from you .
sure you do . you were thinking : ' that ' s no cap gun in that kid ' s overcoat . ' you were thinking ' i can ' t let that kid get on . the bus alone-he might never get on the bus again . ' you were thinking : ' i ' ve got to find a way to distract this kid . ' so you did . it was -- in its way -- a noble act .
thanks for the halo , <person> , but i ' ve . never done that much thinking ahead in my '' life-ever . <person> looks -out the window , pondering this .
<person> will eat him alive !
then talk to your brother , goddamn it . the two of you don ' t need any advice to get into trouble .
well i ' m real scared .
<person> right you ' re scared . i can see it in your eyes . <continued_utterance> go ahead . <person> it . <person> that <person> wagon and see what happens .
<person> left me this morning .
she ' s left before .
you gon na pay for that , <person> .
<person> !
we ' re not moving .
oh . i let the answering machine pick up the other call . <continued_utterance> great .
really ? how screwed ? like i knew it was a rule but i ' m a little fuzzy on the exact details .
you ' re cursed , man , and if you stay here then we ' ll all be cursed . you have to leave .
i h-a-t-e hotel bedspreads . they dont hardly never get washed , and i dont like the idea of lyin on other peoples dirt .
come look at this .
that ' s probably not the problem , then . what about your lifestyle . any major changes recently ?
i ' ve been trying to finish a book .
. i think so . you ?
more or less .
<person> , he wasn ' t expectin ' that !
thelma !
a what ?
i thought you were a science major .
<person> . then you ' re not her grandmother .
raised her like she was , but no , <person> ' s my only child . he was a good boy , till the army took him . <person> looks once more at the old photograph .
what did you tell him ?
i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks .
well , theres a good side as well as a bad side to it . the good side is i knew your daddy , and i thought <person> was a good ol guy .
you knew my daddy ?
you ' ve kept up your end of the bargain , i ' ll do the same . but you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
but i hate cops , remember ? except for her .
i know your mind is on your wife but you should never treat a woman as an equal . you want to get your wife back , get another woman , one of those big hip women that will ride you till you sweat . <continued_utterance> double the stakes ? <continued_utterance> m . c . , you ever heard of a real man having one woman ?
no , lord !
i ' m not talking about the crater .
he ' s promised us answers .
it ' s okay , don ' t bother , <person> .
i ' m sorry . thank you for the party .
but they ' re going to find a way to get you out . they ' re lined up for your office - <continued_utterance> -- your job . your life . your position . they are working day and night . to cheat you out of your <number> % vote . and they are going to sell this tradition , this tradition of words , so they can eat at a better cafeteria . and what they don ' t know is this - - people will read again .
i got it .
bitch . <person> ' s band .
<person> ' s band ?
well -- we ' re right here . <continued_utterance> come on . <continued_utterance> there he is .
his last name is <person> ?
<person> .
hey . it ' s me .
nothing . he asked for directions . <continued_utterance> we got ta get outta sight -- half the fucking army ' s looking for me .
they ' re not looking for me . <continued_utterance> let me have the film . . if i can ' t get to the hotel i ' ll come back here .
do you have a pen ? i just got promoted and don ' t have my new cards yet .
of course .
yes .
and she wanted to talk .
i was kidding about that .
i wasn ' t . and this time it ' s legal .
but you ' re a great swordsman ! <continued_utterance> you ' re not a warrior , <person> ! a warrior wouldn ' t lie there and do nothing ! he kicks <person> ' s boot and knocks his feet off the log . <continued_utterance> we ' re in trouble ! you ' ve seen the big army that ' s after us ! you ' re a fake ! you ' re a bum ! you ' re a -- you ' re a coward ! !
what ' s with you , <person> ?
oh , i disagree .
how can you disagree ? `` there but for the grace of god goes us , '' that ' s what they ' re saying . as if our bodies is who we are , but it ' s not . it ' s our souls is who we are , but they don ' t know that .
' pride goeth before a fall . '
' who knows his own strength is twice armed . '
<person> to fix . <person> .
and i ' m <person> .
what the hell are you playing at ?
trust the nigga , we not playin ' .
this is bad . if we ' re caught with that little daikini it ' ll be the end of us . <person> , ranon , i need that for the festival . <person> , what are we going to do ?
we ' re gon na give this baby a bath .
<person> ' em harder ! no rest at mid- day ! we need to make ten more leagues by dark !
<person> ! <person> ! i have this baby . we found her in our village . will you take her . ?
you lack honor . you lack compassion . you lack honesty . you lack humanity .
<person> . maybe some of that is true --
you want to kill me , <person> ? go ahead .
where is she <person> ? -
what stuff is that ?
<person> ' s stuff . <continued_utterance> so do i need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything ?
he could be anywhere by now .
i don ' t think so . because he ' s a foreigner . he ' ll come back to the city . after six years in confinement , it ' s the only place that ' s familiar to him . that ' s important .
you have no right to keep us here .
yes i do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
oh , see - i killed it . oh , i killed that poor little honey bee !
oh-oh- cu - <person> crying - speaks -
on the contrary , i envy you .
i will miss you all the days of my life .
say nothing . nothing ' bout her .
no . hey . we ' re sorry , man !
<person> . wasn ' t it a dreadful picture ?
i thought it was nice . <continued_utterance> are the kids asleep ?
you fingered <person> for his father ' s disappearance and pressed me to do the same to cover your ass !
he was the prime suspec-
to think you constitute one of my ancestors
<person> , buddy . thinking big is fine . . but you shouldn ' t forget where you come from , either .
i ' m just going to my car ?
that ' s right on my way .

we ' re being run out . apparently , <person> was so optimistic about money coming in for <person> , he figured he ' d double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with ringling . so he sent mr . <person> into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job . <person> , she . <continued_utterance> . she was the police chief ' s wife . mr . <person> got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town .

<person> about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped . i handed it to him on a silver platter . i told my father and those people .
<person> , it ' s not your fault , and it ' s not your decision .
i ' m better than that .
you ' re also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that ' ll never see a screen , regardless if it ' s leading lady gets `kidnapped ' or not .
i just want to look at it . remind me of what i ' m dying for .
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
i don ' t have a goddamned idea . <continued_utterance> okay . what do you do when you don ' t have a witness ?

which was a big mistake . i see that now . you think it won ' t be awkward the next morning but -- trust me , you just want to rip your eyeballs out . <person> , if you want to impress <person> , tonight at the feast , do the fertility dance with her , then drag her back to your hut .

when he came within range of the money -- boom . ingenious . m steps forward . her fury controlled .
we ' ve been pawns in someone ' s game . they tricked us into bringing the money to king . not just elaborate . cock-sure .
we run they ' ll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we ' re americans they might get scared , think we ' re part of a detachment and keep on going .
they ' re not going to --
quite a drop .
yes . not to be morbid , but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides .
a man like <person> ' s got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he can ' t ever fill it . he can ' t kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it . and it drives him mad .
so what does he want ?
they ' re shooting for real ! this is all real .

that ' s cop bullshit .
well , you ' re half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
no !

more scurrilous , unsubstantiated gossip .
perhaps . but it does explain how an ex-kgb agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people . if you believe what you read in the papers .
they said i couldn ' t get in with my ticket .
it ' s for last week ' s game .

what ' s wrong with you ?
nothing . why ? do i seem different ?
they ' re so friendly . <person> ' t you think they are the friendliest flower ?

in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity , this is not so true for the usa . using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search . the odds are not high , and we found variables that reduce the odds . we hire drivers with nothing to lose . then we throw a lot of product at the problem . some get stopped . enough get through . it ' s not difficult .

<person> looked real skeezed this morning . like he was on a dope jag .
<person> ?
to do what <person> never could . to destroy their kind forever . when he awakens , he ' ll see the wisdom of what i ' ve done .
he won ' t ! you can ' t kill an entire race !
it wasn ' t constructed for its aesthetic values , you know , but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter . now go on .
but i ' m perfectly comfortable and i find your store magnificent . what splendid achievements , what gigantic strides mankind has taken , what .
it ' s very good .

because my opinion threatens yours , it ' s poorly developed ?
what if it ' s a valloro <number> ? just going to bounce right up out of the ground , explode in the air , kill him and us .
you just go when i say go .

did he try to kiss you ?
yeah , but he didn ' t see me .
<person> up buddy buddy . you shook gekko the great ' s hand and you still got all your fingers . he ' s not the only elephant in the jungle .
to find out if he knows anything . if you think he does , you got ta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped .
<person> , <person> , tapped the phone ? you think so ?
but you ' ll never forgive me . <person> .

what ' s wrong with this world ? there are sick people out there ! <person> ' son of a bitch like that takes up my time . cuts into the amount of hours i have available to deal with other people interested in my wares ! there ' s no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country .
then it ' s the worst kind ?
they ' re all good , sir .
i might be very interested , but why ? why you mate -- how ' d you get mixed up with <person> ? he doesn ' t know the difference between raiding and insider trading . i do . the sec does .

my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . every summer , the way they kept me and <person> out of trouble was to send us to big daddy ' s farm . we would get up with the chickens . every summer the fence had to be repaired . the barn needed a coat of paint . we had to pip all of big mama ' s hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday . for big daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . <person> will never have to bust his knuckles like we did .

if you manage to seize an inconceivable <number> percent of all drugs coming into this country , you ' ll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than <number> percent which won ' t affect drug use at all .
trust me , <person> , when the family pet ' s been assassinated , the owner doesn ' t want to hear one of her students was the triggerman .
does she want to hear it was one of her professors ?
the winds would have blown them away by now . we should look for signs of a campfire .
or we could just start there .

'
you are a toy ! ! ! you aren ' t the real <person> , you ' re an action figure ! ! you are a child ' s plaything ! ! !
you are a sad strange little man and you have my pity . <person> .
i want to buy it . i think it would make one hell of an investment .
investment ?
great job you got .
well . i like it . because even in this little town , i feel like what i do is very connected with the real center of people ' s lives . i ' m not saying i ' m always mr . <person> , but i don ' t feel like my life is off to the side of what ' s important . you know ? i don ' t feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people . i don ' t feel like a negligible little scrap , floating around in some kind of empty void , with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies i can scrape together on my own .
hablar slowly , por favor . my ingles no es bien .
<person> . you know .
you ' re a mess .
the report . i ' ll never .

she ' s in high school . she ' s sexually active . she ' s on drugs . she ' s crying out for some help .

<person> naked is no big deal . it has nothing to do with emotion , nothing to do with love . you can be around all the naked girls you want and you won ' t be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life . <continued_utterance> see that ? you don ' t know me even one ounce better than you did before . you and your stupid magazine . i liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human , like the rest of us .

i ' ll pass . <continued_utterance> i think you ' d better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .
<person> ' t give up on me now , <person> .
they ' ll never stop .
that ' s fine with me . i wish you would ' ve stayed married to dad .
oh , don ' t wish <person> back on me .
<person> like you might approve of that .
it might be the safest thing . are you hungry ?
oh --
<person> was even going to let them kill toto yesterday for biting miss gulch . oh , please , professor , why can ' t we go with you and see all the crowned heads of europe ?
well , you just have to move further out .
now how far would further out be ?
mr . <person> was ultimately charged twenty-four hundred dollars for labor , which according to our figures is about the average cost of an aluminum siding job .
i don ' t get the point of this .
i can ' t do it .
a half hour across the bay . <person> air . do you good .
okay .
now what ' s the problem ?
i ' m swell .
and all we ' ve got is a witch doctor !
palmer , how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on ?
oh , i got you . not too long .
the eighteenth ?
there ' s a two week waiting period in this state .
hey , <person> . <person> doesn ' t look his way .
hi , <person> .
so you found <person> , huh ? that ' s awesome . <person> kept calling for him , but he wasn ' t around . i guess <person> was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks . who knew ? <continued_utterance> so , you gon na ask about her , or you just gon na sit there all sober ?
i know .
<person> ' t you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? that my drugs had gone through . what would have been the harm ? a few people get high who are getting high anyway . your partner is still alive . we avoid having breakfast together . <person> ' t you see this means nothing ? that your whole life is pointless ?
you ' re breaking my heart .
mr . <person> ! he hasn ' t done anything wrong !
<person> ! what do you think you ' re doing ! i tell the planting seeds in this village .
all this , because you fell for <person> ?
five more turns and your neck will break . <continued_utterance> since i was a child , i ' ve always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldn ' t rescue me from the kidnappers , i knew i had to form a new alliance .
what does <person> say ?
he wants to be me . or he will kill me .
you tricked me , damn you !
take it easy .
showdowns bore me <person> , neither side wins . you can have the company , in fact it ' s gon na be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it . what do you think is a fair price for our stock <person> ?
the break up value is higher . it ' s worth <number> .
roy , slow down --
hey ! i just hit a eight degree driver off a cart path here , i ' m staring eagle in the face --
we ' re following fire trucks ?
yeah .
oh , <person> . you ' re such a putz .
i know .
what . ?
i was gon na wait till the islands , but .
must you ?
goodbye , <person> . don ' t hate me .
yeah , i forgot --
phone or mail , <person> . <person> negotiable .
tell me what to do , <person> . i need guidance , not a fucking platitude . i ' m not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with . i won ' t do it . i want our life back .
i built our house and i don ' t want to lose it . every stone , every brick , every board . my business . that would take a lot of private study . that you don ' t have time for . i suggest you look into the coronel . into selling it . if you can stomach it , you should look into it .
your hands are filthy . look , there is dirt way under this fingernail .
leland , what are you doing ?
he seemed pretty upset this morning .
he ' s nervous about the interview .
we do not go into your courts .
people who don ' t go into our courts when they ' re told to sometimes go directly into our jail . <continued_utterance> look , i ' m genuinely sorry .
sometimes i don ' t even trust me .
i ' m not afraid of you .
i ' m calling from professional nurse quarterly .
from the magazine ?
a little of this , a little of that . mostly i tell fortunes .
where ' d you learn to do that ?
you don ' t like <person> ? since when ?
it ' s not that i don ' t like him . but the wedding has really got me thinking and . i just keep myself opening up . growning . and i want you keeping up with me here .
he ' d been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected .
who is he ?
it ' s a long story , but yeah , more or less .
<person> . you ' re going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . <person> , at six o ' clock . look it up . we ' re taking a trip . be there at six and you ' ll have plenty to tell your people .
do you think you could ever shoot someone ?
what ?
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel , none of whom had any expertise . <person> is just one of those words . people stop paying attention .
that ' s frustrating .
<person> , look at this dinosaur book . <person> ' t you like a dinosaur book ? <person> , maybe you could read this to <person> while i wrap things up here . <person> down , read , and don ' t listen to anything i say . <continued_utterance> and the dinosaur book too .
the world is not driven by discounts , believe me . i ' ve been in business forever . i started helping my mother here after school when i was six years old . i used to watch her , and it wasn ' t that she was selling books , it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be . when you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does . i guess i ' ve gotten carried away .
where ? !
way up ahead !
you ' re a vision , <person> , a goddamn vision of loveliness , you always are .
have another drink , thelma .
<person> powerful words .
yes .
he wasn ' t .
so why are you wearing his watch ?
that one ' s <person> .
oh really ? what ' s <person> ?
so you don ' t feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood not to mention her legacy not to mention her raison d ' etre .
it ' s not personal --
that ' s a wonderful profession . my daughter-in-law ' s a nurse . what did you do , stop ?
yes .
we will , but first i have a surprise .
a surprise ?
<person> tell you shes pregnant ? <person> grins , showing those three brown teeth .
couple grand or mored give you two a leg up . get you to the west coast , mexico , most anyplace , with a few dollars in your jeans . i got it figured good , sailor .
you guys better get the hell outta here ! we got a killer on the loose !
what ?
you mutant bastards . <continued_utterance> whatever you do to me . no matter what youandiacute ; ll make me right . every word i have spoken will be confirmed .
<person> , i hope so .
<person> .
wide awake . i don ' t remember ever feelin ' this awake . everything looks different . you know what i mean . i know you know what i mean . everything looks new . do you feel like that ? like you ' ve got something to look forward to ?
what ?
what do you think ?
thanks for the knitted sock .
<person> ' t mention it .
you always got the best of it around here and when <person> always talks about my son , it is always you , so you fix the roof .
that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . <person> asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you weren ' t a farmer ; get <person> to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell <person> to do it . <person> , you ought to grow up .
i ' ve been a cop for a while , <person> . it ' s hard enough for one person to keep a secret , let alone three . and then there ' s the love angle . i mean do you and <person> really want that little pill-head around , now that you have the money ? <continued_utterance> am i right , did <person> sell you on the idea right up front , of whacking <person> ? that ' s murder , <person> .
police -- god -- get a life .
we keep going , that ' s what we do . we ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
<person> ! how many of them are there ?
then why ' d they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler <number> from <person> and it won ' t open .
well , mr . smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr . <person> from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?
it ' s him .
who ?
<person> ! but i should tell you , this isn ' t really my area . i ' m just on a break from the mud department --
one more word and you die --
i ' m afraid not , ma ' am . <continued_utterance> i ' ll tell <person> to leave the luggage - general waverly ! <person> !
at ease ! how are you , captain .
well , what did i do on <person> that they have to keep me from telling ?
i ' ve no idea . i just work here .
they are much more than that , sir .
is it true that the reason you expelled <person> .
come on , i made us a good dinner . i bought some filet mignon and haagen-dazs butter pecan . when <person> comes back he ' ll cheer you up .
he ' s been here all day .
did you bother to bet , or did you just hand your money to the tellers ?
the sarcasm ' s killing me . i thought you were looking to get even .
this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . i busted her once for possession . she wound up doing about six months at <person> nine .
you mean <person> sixty-nine . <continued_utterance> that ' s what they called it when i was in juvenile . it ' s a pretty dismal place .
just kidding .
one other thing . about this kid , this student of yours- leer -- <person> . you wouldn ' t know how i could get in touch with him , would you ?
hi . can i buy you a drink ? i ' m celebrating tonight .
<person> , no thanks .
that is none of your business .
come on , kiddo . i ' ve been there . i ' ve done it . i ' ve seen it . you can trust me . i ' ll understand .
who do you think did it ?
has anybody asked his wife ? she ' s the one i hope did it .
we ' ve already done the interesting part . do you forget ?
remind me .
<person> , listen to me . the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust . when you call me against my wishes or pretend to be my sister , i can ' t trust you any more .
i know but --
ok . <person> ' s go , pal .
<person> . <continued_utterance> hey , you sure we should do this ?
i said i was sorry .
<person> ' t be sorry . just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst .
no first of all . i ' m not in a game mood .
you ' re interrupting a personal conversation .
<person> takin ' his part ? i ' m the one was cheated . god damn pimps , <person> ' re all in it together .
<person> ' s in anything , <person> , <person> ' re drunk . go home and sleep it off .
i tell you i ' m thirsty , you offer me a sandwich thank you and fuck you .
oh , <person> .
i ' m afraid that ' s not possible .
i must speak to those young women .
excuse me ?
<person> . i ' m in love with her . <person> . then walter ' s voice returns : even , administrative .
i asked where you got him .
where do you think ? i stole him .
<person> . i was driving the car that --
you .
ok but if we can ' t find her then the state will have to become your guardian .
who ' s the state ?
ah ha ! it was so well hidden , you didn ' t even know it was there .
come on , <person> . <person> ' t screw up . you have some real talent .
i need it .
' least you admit it .
i can handle my own affairs , <person> .
not this one . this is washington , d . c . , not the harvard club . how can you be so cavalier ?
look ! <person> !

i ' m sorry ! i ' m sorry ! no harm done !
i ' m coming with you .
you don ' t even know where we ' re going .
<person> .
<person> , the important thing is to relax . you ' re safe where you are . we ' ve got patrolmen cruising the area all night long . just stay calm . will you do that for me ?
in school ?
<person> day .
friends , whence comest thou ?
he wants to know where you ' re from .
how ya doing ?
what ?
<person> , she ' s been like this all day . i don ' t know . she must have eaten something . she did her business and it was kind of . watery .
her stool ? did you look at it for parasites ?
you know i am .
this isn ' t a game , <person> !
and freed the proletariat .
right .
oh . <person> . <person> . i didn ' t know you were here .
would you like me to go ?
<person> . it ' s me , <person> .

i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat .
but she ' s <person> !
the witch ' s <person> ? well -- that makes a difference . just wait here -- i ' ll announce you at once .
they might . yes . that ' s the point . is that they might . you see , the jury wants to believe . they ' re all cynics , sure , because they want to believe . i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . i ' m going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . and every one of them it ' s written on their face , ' this is a sham . there is no justice . ' but in their heart they ' re saying , ' maybe . maybe . '
maybe what ?
if we were a team , we could do anything . i mean , anything .
<person> to the chase , <person> . your audience is way ahead of you .
we ' ll find our way ! we ' ll .
no navicom . a lot of good you are now , <person> .
hi , <person> .
what the hell do you think you ' re doing . ? what ' s going on here . ?

you have me .
they keep him confined ? that ' s bullshit !
that ' s what i said , so i went out and got him a leash you know , one of those clothesline runners for the backyard . he ' s got plenty of room out there to dig . the kid ' s really blossomed . now i can take him to ball games , movies -- you know , happy stuff .
shame on you !
what -- what did you do that for ? i didn ' t bite him .
well . if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school . in the long run you ' d save them thousands of dollars . i mean look at the cost of dental bills . i bet i could have put my kids through college with what i ' ve spent on fillings .
that ' s an interesting point .
dont fuck with me , man . you look like a clown in that stupid jacket .
this is a snakeskin jacket , and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom .
come on , man . i ' ll make a sailor out of you yet .
<person> , or get me drowned .

like most editors , he really wants to be a writer , but he ' s too busy living a novel to bother writing one .
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit .
but he said he ' d make me a star attraction and he did . i ' m pretty lucky he found me .
he was pretty lucky to find you .
shoes , if you want to know the truth . shoes are my thing .
wearing them ? or humping them ?
i thought we ' d find a store , get you fixed up and then get you some lunch . that sound good ?
yeah , sure .

she ' s in the desert . she ' s out in the desert .
what scene would you like in the background ?
something pleasant .
you want chief <person> angry ?
ten years ago i could call for that little pisher ' s head on a stick . and now .
you can walk to work from here .
convenient , ain ' t it ? <continued_utterance> my brother just got married .
the couple purchased twenty-eight hundred dollars ' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record . they say , and i quote here , ' that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to buy aluminum siding . ' is that true ?
it sounds right .
i don ' t think you can help .
is it about love ?
<person> .
who are they ?
yeah ! hi , <person> . what can i do for you ?
um , brian ? did you want us to turn this time sheet in at the end of the day , or do you want it at the end of the week . ?
<person> .

i can make this shot .

i can be better . i will be . and i hate the way i am anymore ! i don ' t know why i do it ! what about that stenotyping thing you were gon na do ?
it won ' t happen . it won ' t happen . it won ' t happen . things aren ' t going to turn out well , things aren ' t going to start looking up , and it ' s never going to be like heaven on a june day . there is no uranium . there is no stenotyping . there is no c . p . a . license . there isn ' t . <continued_utterance> . i talked to dwight : after <person> , he wants you to come up to concrete and live with him for a few months -- go to school there .
i understand that , <person> . but you haven ' t seen <person> in a long time and he ' s battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here .
she is the presumed guardian , mr flaherty .
it ' s no problem . i was just with everybody we work with .
oh , really . general <person> was there ?
so <person> . if i write you a letter , will you write me back ?
<person> .
i bet you didn ' t forget the bachelor party checks .
are we going to do this again ?
well , you ' re probably bored . not being challenged . your application was very good , <person> , but we have many boys who want to go to <person> . not everybody is comfortable at a prep school .
i think i would be . my father and brother went to prep schools .
oh yeah ? now that ' s interesting .
so ! can i get you something to drink ?
i asked you to marry me . i ' m ready for marriage . that ' s responsibility . that ' s growth .
i just think that at some point you ' re going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships .

what are you doing here ?
he wants to talk to you .
<person> <person> . <person> . <person> at any price . you ' d think nobody learned anything from world war two .
<person> had to say it . i respect <person> for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser .
they called , they ' re going to settle , what i want to do is build up as much .

if you want her to stay out of it , then stop telling her everything .
she ' s nosy . she hears me on the telephone .

a place called the stronghold . they died for a dream . but you live . you are their great-great grandchildren and you live . we have to honor their dream . of protecting the mother earth . and being proud of being indian .
last year . i drove my car up a tree . nothing serious , this . . a minor concussion . but the car looked bad . it could have been bad . i think it scared the hell out of norman .
how ' s your marriage ?
you swear ? you act odd .
no , i ' m fine .
this may take another approach .
you can ' t kill <person> . he ' s got too much light on him .
how did she know where it was ? <continued_utterance> our dream house .

i can ' t believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me . to single me out .
what are you talking about ? you didn ' t pay your taxes ?
i never believe what i read in the newspapers .

i ' m gon na protect those pilots .
they ' re boxing us in with these rules of engagement . if you agree to ' em , and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won ' t stop for inspection , the chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting . they want a war , and they ' re arranging things to get one . if you don ' t want one , we have to do something about it .

i thought we ' d have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails .
is that why you got into this business ?
i ' ve always been a collector at heart . when i see something i want , i have to have it .

maybe this ' ll jog your memory . <person> slaps him across the face . healy i ' ll give you a hint -- it ' s got something to do with me being a murderer .
<person> , okay , i might ' ve gotten some bad information .
she wasn ' t part of the deal , <person> .
fine you want to stay here ? <continued_utterance> officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple . completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .
you think he ' s . ?
is he <person> i don ' t know , <person> . it seems to me that <person> is a shield . like you said , a spook story , but i know <person> - and someone out there is pulling strings for you . <person> here and let us protect you .
i don ' t know . into the woods .
<person> . it ' s freezing out here . <person> ' s just get in the car and you can tell me what happened .
you go first .
ladies first . i insist .
it ' s mine .
<person> . it ' s mine , motherfucker .
i got twenty bucks says you ' re full of shit .

i ' m a psychologist -- in layman ' s terms call me a neo-jungian , post- modern freudian , holistic secularist .
<person> .

you need my help . ? you need a goddamn keeper . are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand ? huh . ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ?
we ' re giving the brits polaris instead . but a story ' ll just aggravate things . <continued_utterance> not today . he ' s got tight schedule .
pretending there isn ' t a problem won ' t fix it . he can clear the air on <person> relations .
you do your part .
can you tell what it is ?
<person> to me , goddamn it . we ' re talking about a possible nuclear war . you dropped the ball on bay of pigs --
-- you sonofabitch , goddamn it , i didn ' t drop --
a kind gentleman took pity on me .
i did not .
you realize what you ' re asking me to do here , <person> ? we go down to ac and you get tapped out in five seconds , how does that benefit either one of us ?
that ' s not gon na happen .
i say we use `` the norn ' s <person> . ``
at this close range ? i think `` the alfheim lunge '' is a better move .
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs .
what little dogs ?
<person> , and you ' ll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama ' s old clothes .
maybe , maybe , but no matter how many times i have to repeat : my primary goal ' s to get out of concrete .
lucky guess .
you didn ' t actually purchase this car , did you . <person> ? ?
i told you , this is a shortcut . <person> , you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway . this used to be called `scenic <number> ' because there ' s an amazing view of the valley-
one , you ' ve never been anywhere near here before so don ' t pretend you knew it ' s a shortcut , and two , there ' s an amazing view of shit
ted , have you lost your mind ?
you like me . i like you . i guess it ' s pretty obvious to everyone .
<person> , you have been duped by a textbook narcissist . a brilliant neuropath !
brilliant enough to dupe my entire staff ? i doubt that . <continued_utterance> i ' m giving you back his admitting forms , <person> , to save you any embarrassment .
i don ' t know , yet . what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale , not decreasing . whatever it is , he isn ' t finished .

what kind of a role is that ?
i want to take care of him .
what do i do . i ' m a key figure in an ongoing government charade . an annoyance to my superiors . a joke among my peers . `` spooky , '' they call me . <person> . <person> sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid . who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun , shouting to the heavens and anyone who ' ll listen that the fix is in . that our government ' s hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy . that the sky is falling and when it hits it ' s gon na be the shitstorm of all time . she stares at him for a moment , startled by his drunken screed . she pulls back the shooter she ' s just poured <person> .
i think that about does it , spooky .
that ' s enough .
how the hell are we gon na get outta here ?
yes , don ' t get excited , you still have to give your show ! he ' s not going to arrest them until after the show !
that ' s considerate ! how ' d you arrange that ?
she was more than a friend .
could you call in a favor ?
if you say ' look for the good stuff , ' i ' m gon na get <person> ' s <number> / <number> and shoot myself !
seriously , though : give the place a chance . give him a chance .

<person> off the damn light !
not a chance . remind them that according to the geneva convention , firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war .
they say they are acting on the direct authority of <person> .
and i ' m afraid . oh god , i ' m so afraid of .

rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated . nice move . <person> thing i was here to save your incompetent ass .

you ' re full of shit .
i have done nothing against the ordnung .
eh ? nothing ? <person> , you bring this man to our house . with his gun of the hand . you bring fear to this house . fear of english with guns coming after . you bring blood and whispers of more blood . now english music . and you are dancing to english music ! and you call this nothing ?

oh , but i can ' t .
no , we ain ' t got no <person> . we got <person> .
<person> ?
you ' re right !
what are you afraid of ?
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t <person> . it wasn ' t like that . sure he knew , but <person> had him all turned around . r i ' m telling you straight , i swear . +
let me tell you something . i know dean <person> . i ' ve been investigating him for three years . the guy i know is a cold- + blooded bastard . l . a . p . d . indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force , so don ' t sell me the hooker with the heart of gold . +
<person> ' t be that .
<person> , it couldn ' t be that . <continued_utterance> i mean , i agree , it ' s very important to have . <continued_utterance> . the right car . <continued_utterance> . to take you where you want to go . <number> hours a day .
-- i know . i fed it , and i can ' t get rid of --
you weren ' t sent here to go off on your own detail , <person> . you were sent here to assist in a selective operations <person> . these regional agents are inept -- that ' s why they were sent out here to the graveyard , to indian country . i need you behind me , <person> . not pulling against me .
you really screwed us over but good -- you know that .
i know , i ' m sorry .
i ' m not sure it ' s going to make a lot of difference to the germans .
oh , i don ' t know about that . think about it - you ' re a boche , just working out which of two chaps to shoot - and you thought - `` good lord - one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed ! '' you might shoot the other one instead .
we ' re at war .
we are not at war ! you and i and <person> are awol . we have no authority --
. for my kid rudy -- <number> years old , electronics freak , got a liquid crystal display ' stead of an electronic beam . we ' re going into a new age pal . so how ' s business today .
<person> was at <number> and an eighth when i left the office . it might spin up to <number> by the bell .
you remind me of your father , sor- sha .
my father was a weakling .
well , why don ' t you get your finger out of the way !
come on - come on - over this way .
that ' s <person> earp . <person> quite a name for himself as a peace officer in <person> .
a peace officer . impressive man
it ' s not like i ' m making him jump out of an airplane . when i was growing up , i thought diving was fun .
i thought you were born grown up .
he did too . he nailed me . he knew exactly what i was up to . <person> is just like him .
but he didn ' t exactly answer , did he ?
<person> , i ' m not as dumb as my hair makes me look .
they ain ' t all strictly minor league . one of ' em pays almost two grand ! <continued_utterance> now wait , <person> . you got ta do the math , and you got ta look at how good i ' m playing . i hit the shot of the tournament at the best-ball . they put it on national tv .
<person> . <continued_utterance> <person> .
where the hell are you ?
it ' s just a made-up story about him .
can i read it when you ' re done ?
<person> rid of the gun .
what . now ? out here ? <continued_utterance> i can ' t just leave it here in the woods , some kid could find it .
yeah . he ' s an animal . he prints money . come on , let ' s finish strong .
hold up !
it ' s to the boy who owned <person> . i want to show him how wonderful he ' s looking .
before we take him away across the channel to face a million germans guns .
i tried to break it off !
you should have tried harder .
i couldn ' t say . but even if he didn ' t , you ' d be no worse off than you are now .
yes -- that ' s true .
we could box . and the winner gets the horse .
no , thanks , pet . must be careful not to start a war . do you have a coin of any sort ?
i think i ' ll hang on to these .
<person> again , that ' s government property . you have to sign for everything . i ' ve got one more that wasn ' t on your list .
what ?
you told her she was a `` fuck buddy . ``
i ' d ignore her . <person> can change , <person> .
i ' ll remember you said that .
coach ! hey , i know this isn ' t a great time . and it ' s too bad about <person> . but what about me ?
you talking about sparta ? <person> , please . you got a better chance of starting a boy band . i ' ll talk to you tomorrow .
<person> .
<person> , i ' ll meet you at <number> : <number> after phys . ed .
and i love the inscription you wrote to me . only i ' m not quite the downy innocent you think i am .
i hope that isn ' t true . we need all the downy innocents we can get . grady spies the corner table , watches crabtree say
no . but we still believe in a free <person> .
so where did i fit into all this ?
how long have you known about this ? <continued_utterance> how long have you known ?
six months . i found some marijuana , that ' s all . and a little pipe about two inches long . i talked with her . she said her friends smoked pot and drank --
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess .
who ? ?
i ' ve got something to tell you , <person> .
i ' ve got something to tell you too .
no !
you want to come on in ?
<person> , i ' m not doing too well by checking the stats , so why not . i put my hand to my forehead , i see a one -- mr . motor in the second . twenty bucks .
<person> ' s daughter .
<person> ' t get panicky !
yes , don ' t get excited , you still have to give your show ! he ' s not going to arrest them until after the show !
doctors . their power is in jargon . so you study up . <continued_utterance> is that the procedure for all bilateral periorbital hematomas in a lefort iii fracture of a comatose patient ?
in a lefort iii - absolutely . the potential for sub-cranial brain damage was too great .
wait . uh , no .
i ' m the one who was tailing you .
we better get everybody together .
you go north , i ' ll go south .
<person> , have you seen <person> ?
where was the last place you left him ?
oh , <person> . i ' ve missed you -
is this another one of your games ?
how high you guys think we ' re going with this ?
up to heaven , i guess . that ' s how tall they usually build ' em .
why in hell did you bring that ?
oh , come on , <person> . psycho killers , bears . snakes ! i just don ' t know how to use it . so will you take care of it ? <continued_utterance> whose place is this again ?
<person> at us . it ' s one o ' clock in the morning , on a school night . we ' re in a smoky nightclub , hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart .
i ' m trembling with excitement .
yes , <person> ?
the horse .
<person> - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field .
will they take the harness ?
i don ' t know what you ' re talking -- zukovsky sees christmas appear beside bond : <continued_utterance> help me , don ' t let me drown . <continued_utterance> <person> , alright ! sometimes i smuggle machinery for her . russian stuff .
and the payoff on the tables ?
i think he could do it .
he says older men have been called , and besides , he misses the food . i tell you , susan , he tried to make it a casual letter , with little jokes , but it came out just begging .
i ' d sooner wait outside .
but why ? why ?
<person> sense . you want some more coffee ?
yeah , i ' ll have some .
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night ?
you ' re telling me , but only because you never let me in on any of it . you ' re not going to see <person> , are you ?
what ' s your point ?
now if i ' m the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it ' s just a matter of time . right ? am i right ?
try feeling with your finger .
i can ' t feel anything -- i ' ll give her the stuff for newborns and hope she ' s not allergic to it . <continued_utterance> and then we ' ll have to see if she ' s allergic to iron , to soy or to milk -- you can ' t imagine how much stuff they can be allergic to !
it was you , wasn ' t it ?
it was me , what ?
what if it never happens ? what if
<person> ; s <person> talking .
you should all come with a warning , like car mirrors : `` objects in belly shirts are flakier than they appear . ``
you want to talk about fake ? how about guys who pretend to be from delaware to meet girls ?
what ?
get your ass out here and see what ' s on the doorstep . this has got ta be somebody ' s idea of a joke !
i . uh . i think she ' s doing fine on her own .
oh baby , yes , yes , yes . fuck me like you mean it .
why not ? <continued_utterance> by the way , <person> , you were right about your wife . she ' s a good lady . i ' m glad you got her back .
and i ' m glad you got your sense of humor back . think you ' ll keep it ?
<person> will figure out who and what <person> was sooner or later .
yes he will , so we buy time , keep him busy-
uh-huh .

<person> , i wouldn ' t recommend .
it doesn ' t . sound life-threatening .
i need a cover . i need for you to pretend we ' re having a scintillating conversation . and you ' re wildly entertained . i know it ' s tough .
<person> did this wanted to do <person> one better to improve upon what was already done .
<person> ? you say that like you ' re close , personal friends .

your young partner called me at my home , early this morning . <continued_utterance> <person> inebriated . speaking inarticulately of `betrayal , ' and how the lapd was set to be `blitzed by justice . ' is this the `bind ' of which we spoke earlier ?
yeah .
i don ' t know . probably ignore her .
ignore her ?
you could say that .
were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn ' t do what you could to stop it ?
mr . and mrs . <person> ?
that ' s right .
who ' s gun is that ?
it ' s-it ' s a souvenir . of baltimore .
we might want to perform a spectral analysis .
`` we ? ''
you ' re like this fly , buzzing buzzing everywhere --
-- this play means a lot to me .
oh , big , big deal , who cares , and as long as we ' re passing out news here , i don ' t want to do my paper route anymore .
i bet you don ' t -- big lazy candy hog like you ' d rather lay on his ass and read , wouldn ' t you ? let me tell you something : you ' re gon na deliver those papers if i have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever ' step of the way .
<person> again .
<person> , i admit it was brief , but it was definitely love . crushes don ' t last twelve years .
you bitch .
<person> , you got a man . you just have to take control . .

he would have come back if he could .
only from <person> .
but why stay with them ? look at that mess down there . how could you trust <person> again , when they ' ve endangered you like this ?
<person> , well they may this one .
what do you mean by haul ? what are you not telling me here ?
is there a picture ? <continued_utterance> so that explains it .
he was in jail .
nothing that concerns you spacemen .
i ' d better take a look anyway . <continued_utterance> why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device ?
it ' s the depression , cornell . where have you been ? oh right - cornell . <continued_utterance> here , use <person> ' s second bucket for now . <continued_utterance> you barely use up one .
august , it ' s all right , i ' ll --

i told you not to go into that racket . you could ' ve been a doctor or a lawyer,

i ' ve got something to tell you too .
i ' m going to australia .
hey , don ' t back away from it , you were right . we did look stupid . what you were wrong about , is who made us look that way . <continued_utterance> think back , before the suit was filed , before the trial . <person> had an affair with <person> , right ? so why not tell us about the affair ? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for <person> to fabricate her charge in the first place .
maybe <person> ' s attorney was saving the affair for the trial .
i don ' t even know why you would say that ?
neither do i . it just flew out of my mouth .
this has nothing to do with journalism -- there is more to the world than journalism . we are going to end this war with you or without you . people don ' t really believe in <person> -- they believe in the idea of <person> , no ? because for now the idea of <person> is enough for the people of nicaragua . when the war is over -- none of this matters .
i don ' t do things . like this .
that ' s it ? i mean , you don ' t want to order room service or anything ? we could play games and watch movies and stuff .
are you kidding ? <person> and <person> discover i ' m gone and i ' ll be doing hard time .
because my sister is not a bank , you know ? i can ' t just show up and ask her for --

the fire ' s got the temperature way up all over camp . won ' t last long though .
<person> will we .
you won ' t be able to stop . you might as well enjoy it .
`` <person> will '' is obviously not a big factor in this little world of ours .
you amuse me , <person> . but i ' m the only woman in america born after world war ii who thinks astrology is a crock of shit . now let ' s see if the big dog ' ll eat .

they want to discredit you -- for what ?
the way <person> dances , and he ' s funny . it ' s easy to see yourself married to him .
and <person> ?
uh . yeah but just for a half hour .
hey <person> , you think i could practice with you guys tomorrow ?
i ' m still better than you . nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account .
that ' s not entirely true .

i ' m talking about prayer .
well , i expect you to show me to my quarters .
well , i don ' t know where <person> intends to stick you . that ' s his problem . maybe in his room . but i ' m warning you , mrs .

' who , nora '' ! . who else is there ? the whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me . it ' s one thing when they ' re with you for a night , but when they live with ya , it ' s stretching the point . they got a lot of things they bring with them . you go to the bathroom you see ' things ' you never saw before .
<person> to interrupt you kids , but i thought you ' d better have something to eat . we knocked on your door a few times to invite you to dinner .

okay , you ' ve made your point ! i ' m a creep who gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses . can we drop this already ? christ . i ' m starving . you hungry ?
no . oh , shit . i think i might ' ve left it in the parking lot .
after the `` alleged '' deed was done , they fell asleep . big daddy lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears casanova sawing logs .

we couldn ' t have dropped a cigarette because we don ' t smoke .
he wants two hundred dollars , but it ' s just plain stealing .
<person> says , ' <person> . there ' s a new bar , you go in , for a half a buck you get a beer , a free lunch , and then take you in the back room and they get you laid . ' the bartender , jimmy , comes up to galvin .

what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
<person> away , cupcake . he ' s got a gun .

i was defending myself . he was stealing from me .
very well .
<person> ?
what are you doing with all these blueprints ?
some buildings i ' m working on .
yeah . <person> . that ' s the kid ?
yeah . that ' s the kid !
still , you were right about the celebration . and when the cardinal told me how much it meant to you .
i said nothing .
the cuffs won ' t be necessary .
no offense , ma ' am , but i don ' t think that ' s such a good idea .
do you have someone like me - there ?
no . no one like you . but there are friends who will miss me . - as a matter of fact , i ' m probably late already .
do you need more time ? <continued_utterance> i know this is hard , <person> , but i have just one more question and even though its something we ' ve been over , i want us all to be very clear about it . when you made the decision to stay at mr . <person> ' s house , after he had offered you a ride . when you saw that he intended to have sex with you , what were your exact words ? what did you say ?
i told him , no . i said stop , mr . <person> , please . i screamed for him to stop .

you ' re walking between the raindrops kid . i expect <person> is choking on his royal chamber pot by now .
no . that ' s what ' s so amazing . i killed them . i think .
where ? where are they ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! it ' s something they put into your mind at the memory place . fantasies . that ' s their business . <continued_utterance> you ' re a computer operator . you ' re a bore . you ' re a wimp . you ' re not a killer .
they ' re okay . what ' s that bald spot on <person> ' s head ? ugh .
some sort of infection .
but we did want you . it ' s just that you don ' t always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .
we had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this .
at-at-at-at-at . at-at-at-at-at .
what are you doing ?
i have an idea .
and what would that be ?
yes .
and the windows ?
my problems .
every time you feel a problem coming on , take that out and follow it to the letter . doctors orders .
well , i counseled you , you did exactly what i said , and i just . poured cold water over your effort . i didn ' t get it . i ' m a terrible shrink , probably . i should ' ve never got out of real estate -- actually i should never have left <person> for that cowboy in armarillo -- have you ever been to amarillo ?
a cowboy ?
what ' s wrong mr . <person> .
it seems we ' re short on singers .
that ' s alright , i ' m kinda tired .
you want to insult me ? this is my hospitality . pick one . <continued_utterance> good , now find a room to crash in . <person> , show him .
oh . right .
you must be <person> .
i won ' t let you down , <person> . <continued_utterance> you little pencil-neck . so . yo . sista ! d ' you do anything interesting ?
oh . <person> and i drove up to this little romantic inn , and . pretty much lapped champagne out of each other ' s navels for two days .
just give me one goad reason - <person> , from lloyds of london - why i shouldn ' t kill both of you , burn your boat , and use your bodies for shark bait .
so you two know each other ! ? ! small world , ain ' t it ? what happened ?
<person> ! <person> , tell him . you know this stuff .
the turks invaded , yeah . i guess people would have hidden what they had . but that doesn ' t mean what was in that box is --
<person> . someone stole my car . i parked it right there last night .
are you sure you parked it there ?
hold on a second .
i ' m going to have you disbarred . i ' m going to have your ticket . you know what you did ? do you know what you did ?
in a word : merk . exposed .
that ' s two words . and i ' m out of the `` exposed '' business , remember ? i need to graduate . besides , <person> ' s a boy scout .
how do you know about that ?
it doesn ' t matter . you ' ve forgotten about that boy , <person> . you got scared . just because something happens , doesn ' t mean you can ' t take another chance in your life .
where to ?
out of here .
of course . but , d ' <person> , if this spy was to find out you are here , your life could be in grave danger .
a musketeer is not afriad of danger .
no .
you weren ' t attracted to him at all ?
yeah , i love it .
will it ?
<person> . he ' s using your mother ' s maiden name now .
i know what her name is .
i had a nightmare one night and i didn ' t wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . i think that was the first time . does that count ? megan that counts .
do you knowingly keep <person> and me at a distance ?
jeez , i didn ' t catch it .
so he was a stranger ? it was totally random ?
you don ' t know your own mind . it blocks your heart .
give me a hand . <continued_utterance> poor old <person> , a few drinks , a fight with the sheriff over his wife . and both of ' em ended up dead . <person> takes his boots . <continued_utterance> time to go for a walk , <person> .
i have to answer him .
so you can give us away ?
well , certainly we ' ll reimburse you .
that ' s not necessary . i just felt . . it might be good for <person> to be with his family this weekend .
' that which does not kill me makes me stronger . '
now <person> is dead . he got his revenge .
four is what ?
she looks like a moth , <person> .
it was unintentional .
<person> reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable . he wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was brains . there was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches . <continued_utterance> it ' s that nut of yours .
<person> . i ' m being ridiculous . you ' re right . <continued_utterance> it ' s a brilliant book . our daughter ' s fine . i ' m great .
that ' s right .
no , i ' m too hot now .
you better be careful . you ' ll get a stroke arguing .
-what were you firing at ?
the only lead on magdalena -- we ' re after the same guy you idiot !
i know <person> may seem cold and unfriendly , but don ' t let that fool you .
he really is cold and unfriendly .
i ' m married !
just for the operation in paris . i need to be married . they ' ll be looking for a man traveling alone .
orders from london : for the next ninety-six hours , we ' re to run on full radio silence . double watches , full alert . we ' re to send one encrypted positioning burst to london every six hours - otherwise , zero electronic emissions . the first officer nods . captain inform the men , then run a surprise inspection . if someone paints us , i don ' t want this ship showing up on their radar screen like some god-damned harrod ' s <person> tree .
yes , sir !
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
i have a bit of a goosebump fetish .
no it ' s not okay . it ' s not .
cry for <person> . it ' s okay .
macready , that you ?
yeah !
only way you ' d ever go into therapy was if the shrink was a doll and you were trying to get her into the rack --
you ' re so shallow . the good doctor and i are dealing with my regression and denial --
now , my little coconut , what seems to be the trouble here ? tell daddy everything .
<person> , my daddy ' s still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that .
we picked it out together . we .
welcome .
you see for me it ' s over . over baby . i ' m gon na turn myself in . after the wedding of course . after the wedding . out of respect .
i don ' t think that ' s a good idea .
i ' m with tina . is she there ?
she ' s not here .
what is it ?
it attacks the nervous system . people suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities , sometimes one , sometimes a whole string of them . they can ' t control it .
you don ' t think i can do it .
i think you can get killed .
we ' ve got her sister . testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital . this is the point .
you got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance .
<person> is . . pre-e-epped . <continued_utterance> no one ' s ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before . <continued_utterance> now for the tricky part -- pliers !
i don ' t believe that man ' s ever been to medical school .
nick , where are your hiking boots , water bottle , provisions , survey maps and compass ?
like <person> i enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder .
it ' s bullshit . <person> ' s got no intention of honoring it . they want stemmons files though . i think <person> ' s been working angles for awhile , doing his own investigations .
what did you do to his place ? nice quiet neighborhood one minute , nagasaki the next .
<person> ! stop ! please ! <continued_utterance> is that true , <person> ?
yeah , it is .
yeah . just a little .
<person> strange or bad strange ?
she ' s your sister ?
spiritual sister .
ah .
why you sly dogs , he was right ! i want to say that if more wisdom , or more empathy , or more pure intelligence exists than exits in this man , i want to know about it . do you know that he actually had me sleep here last night ? in his jamies , using his toothbrush !
a mistake ?
a promise .
i ' m not like <person> . <person> was crazy .
and you ; you ' ve got it all together .
i ' m not . <continued_utterance> he ' s so . it ' s too much . and i can ' t . i can ' t breath .
who ? your husband ?
you call it a fluke . i call it a guy maintaining composure and waiting for his opportunity .
conlon beats midnight !
<person> to the chase , <person> . your audience is way ahead of you .
in a word : merk . exposed .
you ' re going to <person> ' s house and i ' m going home .
why can ' t i come with you ?
he didn ' t hit the frame ! i ' ll tell you this , i ' m gon na get the son of a bitch . if he would have apologized or something , but this guy gets out , tries to push me around .
you ' re kidding me ?
well , with the way you flaunt your double d boob job at the free fun pta events that ' s hardly a surprise .
what was that ?
<person> ' t misunderstand me , i ' m just paying you a compliment .
why are you doing this ?
<person> , i have not yet begun to defile myself .
but <person>-
let ' s open it . now .
why you so damn anxious to let him in here .
i can ' t . --
can you tell the difference between dreams and reality ?
you mean the idiot who ruined our operation ?
have you got him ?
to find <person> .
how ?
molly and i are circling each other . i can feel it .
she the enemy , boss .
or maybe you just think you do . just another small town . one guy chasing you . you go big town . just gon na have four guys after you instead . <person> kissy kiss . it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? cause you got ta remember you can run just as far as you can , but wherever you go , that ' s where you gon na be .
i think i ' ve heard that before .
why didn ' t you tell the guerrillas ?
i don ' t know . then they would ' ve killed him i guess . i didn ' t want to interfere .
i came back for you ; this morning i came back . before i even knew about the money . you ' re what i want . the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about <person> . but i ' ve had nothing but time to think about it . it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here . but we ' ve got to get the money , baby . we get the money , i get the car , then we get the hell out .
you said you couldn ' t kill anybody .
i have no fucking idea what you ' re-
-he ever offer her to you ?
<person> , whoa -- i don ' t know what you ' re talking about .
maybe this ' ll jog your memory . <person> slaps him across the face . healy i ' ll give you a hint -- it ' s got something to do with me being a murderer .
lord , that was close . aw , look at my stockings ! and they ' re silk too .
i wonder if <person> got out . <continued_utterance> . i don ' t know how we ' re going to get home . i ' ve never been in new york , have you ?
are you frightened ?
all the time . i feel like i have no one .
<person> , well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there . maybe even change his life and that ' s gone now . i hope you ' re happy .
that ' s not my fault .
you notice my new jumper ? <continued_utterance> my friends buy me clothes , so i don ' t look like trash .
i would hardly say you look like trash .
you ' re officer of the watch , <person> .
i ' m sorry , <person> . it ' s this damned book . <person> gave it to me . <continued_utterance> son-of-a-bitch .
<person> for the fanatics ? what does that mean ?
well , you know . they ' re all coming out of the woodwork now .
<person> . you ' re going to have to go out the back . the data that you copied with your toy . <person> , at six o ' clock . look it up . we ' re taking a trip . be there at six and you ' ll have plenty to tell your people .
if i go out the back , he ' ll know you ' ve warned me .
it ' s not a real bear . it ' s a `` representation '' of a bear . you know , a `` picture . ``
that ' s stupid .
i don ' t think so . in my experience , signs are usually a lot more subtle .
let me get this straight . all that paper that went into the river . that was the only copy ?
well , you
<person> right . <continued_utterance> i was upset . and i was horrible .
put your shoulders back , i said . <continued_utterance> you got nice tits .

all i know is if that viking son of a bitch puts me on smegma duty one more time i ' m gon na have to run him through .
oh shit .
what ' s wrong ?
it ' s out of the question . we ' re a fixture in the neighborhood . we ' re practically a landmark . men for women , women for men , women for women -- what is this ?
you fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you , they arrange it .
so he was a stranger ? it was totally random ?
he was the first hitcher i saw , what can i tell you ? now cut to the chase , how much trouble am i in ?
who ' s the nut ?
that ' s thelma <person> ' s husband .
well , maybe a little .

things no one here understands .
<person> . yes . how are you today ?
i ' m fine .
<person> , i ' m as worried as you are --
no , i don ' t think so . leave me alone , give me money . that ' s what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .
i just figured you was out bein mr . <person> .
not exactly , sugar . one reason were in all the trouble were in right now is cause of what i was doin . i tried to tell you this before .
no , i ' m not going anywhere anymore , i ' ve had it with traveling . i quit .
c ' mon , i ' ll call you a cab , you ' ve still got time .
<person> , it ' s great .
<person> ' you have enough money ? can you manage all right ?

but i ' d do it , i ' d get that one into him . so help me god , i would .
my zipper . it ' s stuck .
i ' m afraid of hurting you .
i don ' t like this , this .
why don ' t you shut up and fuck me , professor . <continued_utterance> i think she ' s starting to suspect something .
sam , you ' re too much .
i went to get myself a salad and i started to see all these vegetables , you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it ' s time to get to the main course you won ' t eat too much . that scam to get you filled up so you don ' t eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff .
that ' s like wondering if your mom and dad do it . who wants to know ?
she isn ' t that old .
madmartigan . he props himself up on his elbows and smiles .
whose side are you on ?
that ' s right .
they obviously wanted it to be known that they offed <person> . some kind of statement .
<person> ' t call him a dipshit .

well he dead . that ' s it for him . over . but we still here . <person> , yeah . <person> ' s gon na be a real bitch for a real bitch .
she probably gone by now .
but it must be planted , cultivated , nurtured . unless . unless you have an economy so well organized that you can devote all your time to study and experimentation .
you ask many questions . time traveller yes ! and i ' m not ashamed of it . that is how man has learned and bettered himself . i must learn about you and your civilization . you have books , don ' t you ? young man <person> . - <person> ! yes , we have books . he rises and beckons . the time traveller ' s brow clears .

i heard <person> on the news again tonight -- i don ' t know : i hate the democrats and the republicans , but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn ' t seem like . . a liar .
they use a laser .
well , yeah , they do . but there ' s definitely peeling involved too . i saw it on discovery health . if more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife .
why would you do this ?
when all is done , we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds . then i , the bastard son , will have accomplished what <person> and <person> never could .
i put up new drapes , jake .
i know . i was here when your apprentice was helping you . remember ?
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !
<person> , i don ' t want to have to take you in for questioning . you ' ve got his car , you were the last to see him
got ta go .
excuse me , mr . <person> ! can you sign an autograph for our grandson ?
<person> , more likely .
still , you were right about the celebration . and when the cardinal told me how much it meant to you .
and old war injury flaring up ?

at your service , my lady . anytime , anywhere .
there ' s a depraved thought . you ' re so delightfully low . <person> filth .

his leg is not good enough , sir .
private , you will do as you are told . <continued_utterance> hook him up .
is it true ? is ignorance bliss ?
look , i loved `` exposed ! '' and i hate it that you got busted . i know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it ' s really not that bad .
i know you don ' t know them . of course you don ' t know them .
why am i looking at pictures of people i don ' t know ?
did you get married real young ?
twenty-four isn ' t young . i ' d already been goin ' out with him ten years when we got married . i ' ve never been with anybody but <person> .
well , things were going great until .
your old friend <person> appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime <person> took off with someone else .
well , want in one hand and shit in the other -- see which gets full first .
but , <person> , that <person> was mine .
<person> ' s stuff . <continued_utterance> so do i need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything ?
it ' s more emotional damage . it wasn ' t very serious physically . <continued_utterance> nothing like when i sent you to the hospital .
<person> ' s going to hurt you . <continued_utterance> you see that ? gold . you take us to the americans , and we ' ll give you another one . now drive .
you are americans , yes ? <continued_utterance> we didn ' t not all want this war , do you know ? we didn ' t not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in kuwait . now your army crushes us . so few days , and so many have died . and many fear we will all die . <person> tell this to your people : we did not want this war . <continued_utterance> i have a brother in our army . when i take you back , will you look for him ? if he is still alive , will you look for him and take care of him ?
well , at least ask him about my gym shoes again . i can practice barefoot but for games i got ta have shoes .
i ' m not a referee . i won ' t do it .
no ! this smug asshole insulted you and i want him to take it back .
we ' re not really that insulted --
that ' s okay , <person> . you ' re doing fine . but i have to ask you something here . when you say it hurt . was this the first time a man was inside you ?
no . i ' ve done it a couple of times , i mean with guys i dated . but this hurt . like , he was built . you know .
of a fight he can ' t win out here .
it ' s his father sir . he ' s suffocating him . we ' ve all seen it . <continued_utterance> i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn ' t even know who his own kid is . what right did then have to show up here ?
yeah .
what was he doing in the rec room ?
but that ' s kind of cheating , isn ' t it ? not to say confusing .
not at all . it ' s a much more organic approach to gaming than classic , arbitrary , rule- dominated games . it ' s the future , <person> . you ' ll see how natural it feels .
how long have you been having them ?
the last month maybe .
i don ' t take sides . i take pictures .
no sides ?
it ' beddy-bye time now , honey , beddy-bye , don ' t cry , sweetheart .
she ' s crying .

oh , how inappropriate is that !
how was work ?
good . i got stuck at the office with a client .
remember that upside down flag back at <person> ' s house ? somebody took it down .
<person> .
one of m ' s more accomplished tin soldiers .
he could identify me .
he loves you very much . he just --
i know he does . <continued_utterance> are you mad at me ?
why do you twist my words ?
you could have told me what i was from the beginning . why didn ' t you ?
bring you back . to pay for what you did to my son .
and if i resist . ?
i can understand coming out to no music , by why in the world would you choose classical music for your entrance ?
this is <person> , <person> . this is <person> to joy .
no . <continued_utterance> how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldn ' t even tell myself ?
what are you going to do ?
yeah . if i want to smoke should i go outside ?
you shouldn ' t be smoking .
<person> . i ' m gettin ' tired .
are you alright ?
saunders , i ' ve lit cigarettes -
not from forty feet . <continued_utterance> the disposable lighter also contains a small self-detonation charge depending on who - or what - you wish to dispose of . <continued_utterance> stop fidgeting , <number> . <person> - he takes out a pair of shoelaces .
<person> , just ask yourself . what do women really want ? you take these bored housewives , married to the same guy for years . <person> in a rut . they need some release . the promise of adventure . a hint of danger . i create that for them .
so you ' re basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i couldn ' t do it .
i doubt it .

that ' s exactly what i ' ve been thinking ! you wouldn ' t believe the things that have been happening to me lately . i just didn ' t know why .
<person> or skinny ?
er , skinny , i think .
elektra , it ' s not too late . eight million people needn ' t die .
you should have killed me when you had the chance . but you couldn ' t . not me . a woman you ' ve loved .
you ' re a vain , greedy , cruel boy !
and you are an old man and a fool !
you know , i never told anybody , but once for about three days , just before her time , <person> ' s arm went completely dead .
what do you mean ?
he ' s lying .
<person> , sir . i ' ll discuss this with the broker and i ' ll get back to you . you ' re welcome . <continued_utterance> if i ' m closing out this account . if he doesn ' t pay for it tomorrow , you pay for it .
that ' s the point , you stupid fuck . let them buy it . we let them buy the case . that ' s what i took it for . you let this drop -- we ' ll go up to new hampshire , kill some fuckin ' deer .
<person> . <person> . <person> .

he ' s different , deeper , and he ' s funny , too . it ' d be nice to be married to both of them .
<person> thing they ' re not a quartette .
yes .
you ' re going to settle out of court ?
he didn ' t have to kill himself , <person> . he could have gone out and gotten a job . <person> , he could ' ve found another rich woman . he never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married . <continued_utterance> i don ' t know why he did it . i really don ' t . <continued_utterance> can i get you anything ? <person> shakes her head , no . <continued_utterance> what , honey ? i can ' t hear you .
i said . i was raped .
it ' s about a hundred miles from where we are now . how long do you think it would take us to --
it ' s not a hundred miles . it ' s a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain : pure desert , mountains , a river . if the map is even real .
no , you don ' t see . there are three of us sharing this place .
oh , three , huh ? a regular ' mirage a trois ' !
yo , <person> .

i don ' t know . oh yeah , sunday -- mrs . <person> brought it up .
pride and prejudice .

oh . is that good or bad ?
it ' s very good .
my problem is i got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie .
my problem is i come here to drink in peace . so if you don ' t mind .
i ' d just rather have someone there with you .
i wish you would ' ve woken me up this morning .
<person> ' t have a choice . my car overheated up the road .
you ' re lucky you didn ' t break down in the desert . day like today , you ' d be dead in no time . when you leaving ?
who are you ?
police .

yeah .
what ' s wrong with this world ? there are sick people out there ! <person> ' son of a bitch like that takes up my time . cuts into the amount of hours i have available to deal with other people interested in my wares ! there ' s no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country .
they don ' t make our job easy , <person> .
negative copy on that , pham , check your frequency . i ' m on forty-nine .
<person> , can you hear me now ?
can i ask you , <person> : do you think your life is important ?

why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ?
what are you talking about ?
for you ! i don ' t even know why -- <continued_utterance> whoever i was , i must have been a helluva guy .
`` whoever you were '' ? ? ?
well , yeah . i ' ll improve .

he says older men have been called , and besides , he misses the food . i tell you , susan , he tried to make it a casual letter , with little jokes , but it came out just begging .
oh , <person> ! what are we going to do ?
it ' s my father ' s pin . he wore it everyday of his life . <continued_utterance> are you trying to break my heart ? or is it just your way with women ?
it ' s not the pin your father wore . it ' s an exact duplicate . <person> is a tiny electrical detonator . we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice , someone who worked at this company .
she told me .
she did ?
who the fuck are you ?
he ' s in love with <person> , too .
and if you hadn ' t taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the nine realms !
i have a truce with <person> , the jotun king .
how high up does this . arms dealing go ?
<person> . if someone wants you dead , it is <person> . our government has nothing to gain by killing you .
there ' s no one here .
norma , are you alright ?
i played in the pro-am with some asshole movie star shot <number> here once . how did a great ball- striker like you , a `legend , ' manage to shoot an <number> ?
i missed a four foot putt on the eighteen for an <number> , that ' s how .
wouldnt make any difference .
what if i told you not to ?
you are a runner . some day you will make eye contact with another runner and --
no one ever even looks at me . they don ' t . on top of which , who are they ? they could like the symphony . i could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony --
but this is a special occasion . it ' s . <continued_utterance> it ' s her birthday .
a birthday is a special occasion . i will therefore bring the special for everybody .
what ?
on the <number> th , right ? how old ?
something inhuman watching our every move .
i said , knock it off .
oh , cut it out ! no more for me !
i tried , but she doesn ' t want anything --
ma ' am , i ' ve been called a lot of things -- but no one ' s ever saddled me with that one .
you might try being saddled sometime -- the smell of leather , the sting of a whip .
how ' s that ? how many times has he been in here , busted you up ?
yeah , but he ain ' t got the salt to truly take a man ' s life . especially not <person> ' s . he was scared of him .
she ' s not alone . she ' s . <person> . oh god . he ' s gone nuts . he killed <person> and <person> . it ' s all .
stop ! you stop right here . i don ' t want to know anymore . i told you not to do this bachelor party thing . you were warned .
not according to the men in blue .
what is it ? kiddie porn again ? sexual battery of a patient ? i ' ve had my license taken away in three states .
something to do with <person> , is what i ' m getting .
she ' s having an affair .
well , why shouldn ' t she ?
no reason . unless she has hypoglycemia .
you . i ' ve got cancer , franklin . it ' s spread everywhere .
i . i ' ll take you to the best doctors .
that can ' t be good .
yes , it could ! <person> be an early spring !
<person> <person> checks out . all

you ' re still convinced there ' s a link to the department ?
if there isn ' t i ' ve just wasted the last six months .
there have been a couple of attempts on my life already .
no ! that ' s unbearable . the company must stop this . they owe you every kind of protection .
a little , i think . <person> ?
yeah ?
my darling <person> . i am so pleased to see you here .
<person> , this is my bodyguard , <person> .
she ' ll come back . that ' s why i ' m going to . . to not have this baby .
not have it .
lem me guess . your cousin from des moines ?

what about the chairs ?
what ? oh , the flat tire ? yeah , i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
<person> ?
she must think i ' m such a nothing , such a loser . a lousy driving range pro living in a winnebago , making five bucks an hour plus lessons .
she don ' t know you live in a winnebago .
<person> baxter . <person> to see you again .
<person> ' s cut the crap . what does your client want ?
no doubt .
tell me again , franklin , why are we here ?
so then there ' s more talk about the wind . while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous . and when you finally get back , you have to clean up the boat .
why don ' t people have boat maids ?
. illegal search of lindenmeyer ' s duplex . <person> civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed . twentyfour citizen complaints . and the calls are just starting to come in . i forgot what it ' s like to have you on the streets .

it ' s too rough .
<person> .
<person> . <continued_utterance> i guess they ' re making up .
are you okay ?
you brought a gun ? <continued_utterance> <person> did you bring a gun ?
it ' s a little immodest to say so , but i consider myself an authority on the fair sex , i ' ve made a study of the subject . they ' re simple creatures .
they couldn ' t fool you ?
he ' s doing ok . he can say some pretty funny things . yesterday he told me i was fired .
<person> ? for what ?
i ' m sorry , i ' m not familiar with it . what style ?
uh , sort of nouveau deco . with a big vestibule . check it out next time you ' re up there .

you put up a great fight , <person> .
yeah --
<person> ? comandante <person> . he is either a marxist dupe of russia and cuba . . or the most popular leader of a most popular democratic revolution . take your pick .

you might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter .
<person> --
she needs to be changed .

so why are you doing it now ?
i didn ' t come for the money . the report you sold him was stolen from an mi- <number> agent , who was killed for it .

no , it ' s okay . i just can ' t believe i left it out in the open like that . crabtree hasn ' t been in here , has he ? poking around ?
i don ' t know -- maybe- i don ' t think so .
well , let ' s just run for it . we outran that one yesterday , at least on a sprint .
run for it ? running ' s not a plan . running is what you do when the plan fails . you ' re not even trying to come up with a plan !

what was that ?
anonymous . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been getting ninety-sixes my whole life . it ' s what they expect . after all this , i still haven ' t figured it out .
it was a play .
boys like him have -- expectations .
that information is classified . you ' re there to gather information on their operations , period .
call me crazy , but i thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side . what else ? you gon na hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too ?
oh no , i got her . right here . <continued_utterance> she can ' t travel to arizona for the regionals -- she ' s got a busy practice , y ' know . so she made me this tape to play while i ' m out there . keep me calm , cool , and collected .
what ' s on it ?
you got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance .
admittance form is wrong .
so you were alone .
yes .
your sister said you don ' t have a family ?
no .
how long have you been doing this ?
' bout ten frames . <person> ' ll you see the pictures -- you look great .
the worst serial killer in history - who ? <person> - right ? killed forty two people . our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day .
<person> , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
no . i want to stay with him .
how sweet .
why ? he ' s not gon na do anything different than what i ' m doing .
yeah . we ' re making it worse !
and i do not plan to meet him . why do i get the feeling that you are in here somewhere ?
i came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out . well how am i supposed to meet someone ?
oh god .
i snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . and when i woke up in the hospital . somehow it hadn ' t . <person> now .

easy . i just wanted to tell you <person> ' re about to start changing <person> here . lots of so-called hard cases and tough-nuts swagger <person> this town but none of ' em ' s got a clue about the real play . none of ' em .
i don ' t understand .
what are you up to ?
i ' m writing a letter .
no . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to kill him , <person> . <continued_utterance> the closer i get to this guy , the more i . it gets to me . i don ' t know .
i think you ' d better go on home , <person> . you ' ve fallen in .
well , sir . we have this show , and we laid off for the holidays . you see , business was bad .
i know about business being bad .
i can ' t just pick up replacements from radioshack ! i made most of that equipment myself !
then i ' m sure you can do it again .
what are you doing here ? i thought you were . , dead .
oh no , they told you ? i fibbed a little but . <person> ' t be mad . oh . <continued_utterance> the fam .
where is <person> ? how far is it ?
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by <person> many years ago . her name is <person> .
i ' m relaxed !
take a vacation .
<person> ' s retirement party . i ' d just put the knife into the cake , and -
come on . i know better than that - <continued_utterance> it must do something .
<person> ? <person> , tomorrow , central park at the fountain near the merry-go-round , five o ' clock . be there , but . <continued_utterance> . that was it .
all we can do now is hope our plan works .
have you tried whistling ?
what ?
tarafly . analysts don ' t like it . i do . the breakup value is twice the market price . the deal finances itself . <person> off two divisions , keep . <continued_utterance> bluestar airlines .
. rings a bell somewhere . so what ?
artsy little village down seven . there ' s a guy there who sells my work . i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car . i saw norman sitting at this little cafe . <person> waits for her to continue . <continued_utterance> i started to walk over . but he wasn ' t alone . a blond . i only caught a glimpse . she was young . i should have said something right away .
why ?
where do you have to go ?
i ' m supposed to -- i got ta get <person> back her car .
well , folks , what ' s the plan ?
first let ' s see if <person> ' s still out there .
well . there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about .
i ' m doing a piece on skybolt . i hear <person> ' s meeting with him in nassau .
you remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like <person> . and your teacher , <person> said , `` you ' re too late , <person> . there ' s nothing left to explore . `` and all the other kids laughed .
how do you know about that ?
i blew the eight ball .
you lost ?
is it fresh ?
yes , it ' s fresh !
happy ?
can we contain him long enough ?
<person> .
what ' s he doing out there ?
mine . land mine ! <continued_utterance> i stepped on a land mine !
you didn ' t step on any mine .
hey , he finally made it ! <continued_utterance> do you have any idea what time it is ? it ' s four . you said two .
but , <person> , i missed the plane .
<person> ? your father looks rather strange .
well , mother , he is sitting in his own bowel movement .
is that what you were trained to do ?
no .
yep . you ' re right . that ' s why i ' m here .
what ' ll it be ?
he had polio . probably still contagious .
<person> ' t dismiss me because i sit in this chair !
<person> told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago . <person> with <person> at universal . he thought he was humoring me . until i got it . they offered me the role . there in the room . so <person> , who i ' m sure never thought in a million years i ' d land that part , makes some phone calls and just like that they don ' t want me anymore . nobody calls now . i can ' t get in to see any studio casting people . he ' s ruined me in those circles .
and you still want it-
therefore , to signify my covenant with the one true god , on this night will i circumcise the flesh of my foreskin , and of you and every male who dwells hereby .
here we go again --
<person> <person> ? sure . who could forget ?
i ' ve forgotten and i don ' t know why . did anything unusual happen with him ?
against a window .
in the passenger car ?

come on -- come on . <continued_utterance> where do we go now ?
dr . <person> ; page <number> , ' contraindications to general anesthetic . ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic . ' does that sound familiar ?
yes . i wrote it .
i meant biologically .
that ' s a crappy thing to say .
maybe i like to find out about a man first . maybe i like to know what he ' s made of .
i ' m just flesh and blood , baby . that and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . but you already know that . you read my mind , remember ? thanks for the lemonade . <person> turns to leave .
<person> begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world . <person> is completely overwhelmed .
what if every country legalized at the same time ?
you know what he is talking about here ? <continued_utterance> awe . humility . he ' s telling you that he has traveled the seas as <person> did . as <person> had before him as he tried to find his way home to ithaca after the trojan wars . `` that deep browed <person> '' . <continued_utterance> brilliant , seasoned , wise , of the mind ; `` . ruled as his demesne . `` he commands the voyage of the imagination , like a god . that is what one of the greatest literary minds of modern times , mr . <person> , has to say about <person> . <continued_utterance> you think the odyssey is dull ? i ' ll tell you something , it ' s about each one of you -- right now . <person> and expectation . friendship , community , self sacrifice and accountability . <continued_utterance> this isn ' t just a story ! ! it ' s history made allegory . it is a philosophical handbook for life ! it holds the secret of this very voyage .

yeah , we ' re beat .
<person> , thanks but --
i know , you ' re incredibly busy .
for forcing me to face my life honestly for the first time .
i didn ' t mean to hurt you , <person> .
in isolated cases , sure .
what is that supposed to mean ?
something ' s gone wrong -- something unanticipated . go back to <person> and dig . or you ' re only going to find out like the rest of the country , <person> . when it ' s too late .
how can i reach you ?
what happened on the charges ?
guilty on a reduced charge . <person> dollar fine and ordered to desist . pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place . you seen it . <person> filth . <continued_utterance> its a serious situation . not like the turks and the armenians , maybe , or the <person> and the jews , but i want people to remember me and what ive done and pick up where i left off . <person> had to make a move . it was nice meetin you folks .

i don ' t want courage . i don ' t want to be a warrior . all i ' ve ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !
real magic , <person> , is simply the art of controlling the reality of others . you lack faith in your- self . you must learn to trust your intuition . <continued_utterance> go in the direction the bird is flying .
two-hundred and sixty-seven men , women , old people . and little ones like you . many killed running along that road you see there .

<person> me , but - i must formally protest this meeting . given the nature of what ' s occurred - and the need for secrecy - i see no reason to involve the air force , the army , or mi- <number> . this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majesty ' s <person> .
i hope it means something , otherwise .
otherwise whatever we ' re looking for could be anywhere .
we had a deal . no one touches the gold until we ' re out of here . no one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .
what if it hadn ' t been wes ? what if . i mean , accidentally , what if i had .

it ' s all i ' m good for -- but you can count on me for that , at least .
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of europe .
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines . there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world .

about enough to buy maybe five volumes in a set of encyclopedias .
it ' s a start .
it ' s good this way .
but i want to see your face while we make love .
we did it ! we faced temptation and we did not bend !
damn straight ! now there ' s nothing between us and bixby but nothing ! they zoom past the sign . val last time we ' ll see that sign !
thirty five a month with locker . we ' re open at <number> , lights out at <number> .
sure .
pros -- prozze <person> . daj noge .
go on .
these people play very rough . they don ' t want to lose this case . there ' s a lot of pressure they can bring to bear , i .
there ' s nothing they can do to me .
we ' re americans !
come to help you ! ! <continued_utterance> give me a hand . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> . ! you okay ? <continued_utterance> <person> ? !
`` <person> ? ''
doctor <person> . he ' s part of our team .
yessir .
<person> . what else do you do ?
<person> there ! !
surprise !
something before take-off ?
oooowww ! ! that hurt . you biii -- she slumps . <person> looks at <person> .
oh ?
it seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed . <continued_utterance> i ' m not very happy with you right now , <person> . but more importantly , <person> ' s not very happy and he ' s gotten the police involved . they seem to think <person> is somehow responsible for all of this . you wouldn ' t happen to know where <person> is , would you , <person> ?
what were you doing in my room ?
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet . now why did you lie to me ? where did you go ?
that a fact ?
yeah . it ' s a fact .
no we haven ' t .
in a previous life .
wait a second --
ah , i can smell it on you .
<person> . its all right . also , i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed .
you fucker , dont you ever touch <person> - you fucker , <person> kill you .
<person> , mr . <person> called . why weren ' t you in class today ?
he lies ! i was there ! i was in the nurse ' s office , cause i had a headache .
but i can ' t go anywhere ! i ' m all locked up !
you got yourself here .
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart .
or building blocks for a world that never formed . <continued_utterance> i ' m not smart . just a sponge .
right ! he can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from earth . beach condos , ski resorts , you name it .
no wonder he wanted you to .
it ' s finished . i won . <continued_utterance> maybe it wasn ' t a specific moment , maybe it-
i had a nightmare one night and i didn ' t wake you up so you could tell me it was okay . i think that was the first time . does that count ? megan that counts .
no , they were asleep when i got here .
they ' re really cute . so what can i do for you ?
in the darkest moments , it ' s what i live for . especially since i ' ve heard how much you like to watch . on the hidden camera .
by the way , <person> : ordinarily i would never ask , but . <person> ' t you and that <person> once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea ?
i can ' t remember anything about last night . is there something i should remember ?
no , you should forget about last night .
is it them ?
it ' s them , <person> . now , <person> , listen to me and listen to me carefully . <person> to me as you never listened before .
shoot .
boy or girl ?
<person> ' t you just leave the bridge open for us ?
to keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the bifrost and destroy jotunheim with you upon it .
an arsonist and a kidnapper . he just got outta prison .
well . i still don ' t think he ' d turn me in .
-dubious honor if you knew the other people <person> knows . so you want to catch her in violation of her service contract ?
exactly . the morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating : nymphomaniac , criminal , communist . anything along these lines . once you visit the set of her `attack of the atomic vampires , ' you ' ll see the void that is her character . we haven ' t a photograph handy , but she ' s playing the lead female role .
that ' ' s nice . all we have is a japanese beetle trap .
it ' s a bathtub . what she ' s standing under . <continued_utterance> there ' s pop . let me see it . the gun . <continued_utterance> figures . it ' s like the kind of gun <person> would carry . in a little beaded purse ?
i seen this hole on tv . hit the big dog down the chute --
no , i ' ve learned my lesson . <person> na play it safe , smart , conservative . fairways and greens . hand me the two iron .
i ' m not sure i made the slightest difference . i tried . i really did .
there are a lot of encouraging statistics . the work ' s just started , but i intend to see it through . you ' ve got my word on that .
tell them we ' re the american school ship , <person> .
they think we ' re carrying cuban refugees . <person> , they mean to board us .
they sent me here , <person> because they said you didn ' t hold up your end of the arrangement , and i have to transport you back to leavenworth .
what the fuck , man ? what do you people want ? i did what you wasi ' cu ' s told me to do .
no you ' re not you ' re glad , because now you ' ve got a witness . i heard the other police talking last night . they don ' t seem to like you very much .
they kid a lot .
oh , i got it on the street for a dollar .
it ' s nice .
no , i have not .
you ' re just waiting for the green light , right ?
what things ?
i ' m going to work out .
<person> , i ' m sorry to be putting you through all this .
hey , you ' re not putting me through anything that you don ' t have to go through yourself . i ' m with you all the way . trust me . <person> ? jill nods . <person> leans forward and kisses her . <continued_utterance> that ' s my girl . he gets up and walks out of the room talking . <continued_utterance> now try to relax . we ' ll get some sleep . you ' ll be surprised how differently things will look in the morning .
i have to talk to you .
what do you want ?
i don ' t want to hear any tales about colored people .
but these are white people , anybody . the punch .
and you wrote that .
yes .
i already made you two tapes .
<person> , you have to deal with _all_ of this .
why would you want to go to school if you didn ' t have to ?
it ' s weird , <person> , but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework .
hi , <person> . <person> ! when did you get in ?
just now .
so , macready , come on now . these norwegian dudes come by . find him and dig him up .
<person> , they dig him up and cart him back . he gets thawed out , wakes up and scares the shit out of them . and they get into one hell of a brawl .
just go around him .
<person> .
<person> ?
you don ' t know me .
i couldn ' t catch my breath . that ' s not a metaphor , that ' s . and i panicked . i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there . i tried to leave him . went to my mother ' s in boston . he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home . <person> is mesmerized . <continued_utterance> you must think i ' m pathetic .
no . no , i don ' t .
forget it . i got vegetables coming out my ears . usually the varmints eat up half my crop , but lately i ain ' t so much as <continued_utterance> we playing cards tonight ?
i think i ' m gon na be sitting up with her .
huh ? oh . <person> or fury . with <person> and <person> .
she went crazy , <person> .
<person> . <person> loves you .
but <person> a robber and a manslaughterer and i havent had any parental guidance .
have you ever considered laying off the female sex for awhile ?
what other kind is there ? ' the <person> . ' sister act !
i know you didn ' t .
he had no right to do that .
please , professor , why can ' t we go along with you ? <continued_utterance> . polite ! we haven ' t been asked yet .
he ' s perfectly welcome . as one dog to another , huh ? here now -- let ' s see where were we ? <continued_utterance> oh , yes - you - you wanted to go home , huh ?
of course you will .
i ' m just saying , you ' re going to be fine .
<person> ! ! <person>r-whirrrr ! ! !
hey everyone ! rc ' s trying to say something ! <continued_utterance> what is it , boy ?
the richest one percent of this country owns half the country ' s wealth : <number> trillion dollars . one third of that comes from hard work , two thirds of it comes from inheritance , interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what i do -- stock and real estate speculation . it ' s bullshit . <person> percent of the american people have little or no net worth . i create nothing ; i own . we make the rules , <person>dy , the news , war , peace , famine , upheaval ; the cost of a paper clip . we pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it . . you ' re not naive enough to think we ' re living in a democracy are you , <person>dy ? it ' s the free market . you ' re one of us now . take advantage of it . you got the killer instinct , kid , stick with me . i got things to teach you .
obviously .
i told you , <person> .
but where ? i need the street .
i didn ' t know you were a jane austen fan . not that it ' s a surprise . i bet you read it every year . i bet you just love mr . <person> , and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really , honestly and truly going to end up together .
would you please leave ? <continued_utterance> please ?
i wish i was home .
c ' mere . she goes to him , lies down , and they embrace .
her -- her name is <person> .
that ' s right . what ' s she doing ?
<person> , please . this is out of your hands .
i know i made things worse . i know that and i ' m sorry , but <person> i need something from you . something only you can help me with .
what are we waiting for , let ' s go .
<person> . <continued_utterance> does the cardinal know you have this information ?
you ' ve been back to dallas ?
yes .
it ' s just the first wave . you can be part of the second wave . ok , <person> . put your arms up . i have to scan you . metal and heavy synthetics can ' t come in .
a weapons check ?
<person> , that ' s probably it . so you ' re saying we can ' t go in ?
i just told you ! to enter is instant death ! only i can go in and only once a year after very elaborate purification rituals and days of special prayers and offerings .
one thing puzzles my mind , sugar . youre twenty years old - arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart ? puttin a detective on us . <person> tell ya <person> . well . its moren me killin <person> .
maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much .
are these the talking rings ?
yes .
i ' m not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello .
i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day . that ' s different .
and his account ?
you have a credit line of a million and a half .
do they have any special powers ? the bosses always have special powers .
you wan na check it out ? come here . <continued_utterance> first we ' ve got <person> , the psycho looking biker . in charge of transportation and smuggling . controls every trucking union in eastern europe . <person> ' t look too clean , either . <continued_utterance> next we got a siberian redneck , <person> . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .
' his heart , once capable of inspiring others so completely , could no longer inspire so much as itself . it beat now only out of habit . it beat now only because it could . ' grady nods , his face unreadable , then <person> returns .
i ' m ready . <person> stops , sees the two men looking at him . <continued_utterance> you all right , professor <person> ?
here i am thinking about myself when poor <person> is resting on the floor of the kitchen .
it feels like a storm has passed . <person> read some of <person> ' s letters to a woman he had a child by . the child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort . <person> didn ' t know that deep down at the bottom of <person> ' s hate , there was some love .
i was hungover !
maybe that was a coaching error on my part .
so what if he was ? it ' s all your years of waitin ' tables has made you jaded , that ' s all .
maybe .
this way it ' s close at hand !
are you out of your mind ? ?
<person> guessed .
he comes here every night to see <person> .
actually , my first choice was ' no comment . ' so if someone asked where i was , i could truthfully respond ' no comment . ' over there .
<person> : is it true you ' re in negotiations to move your offices from hong kong to <person> ?
<person> .
yes .
y ' mean , i take it to the connection ?
yeah , whatever you want to call it .
something ' s wrong !
i ' m gon na unport you now . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to cut you free !
i know what i saw -
i don ' t care what you think you saw . you ' re a damned amateur . just get off my ship . go back to your trench-coats and your code names - and leave the job to professionals .
no .
that ' s , like , in the complete opposite direction !
we ' ve got no cboice . <person> way , we ' ve got no choice .
well ?
so where you headed anyway ?
dr . <person> ' s office . my parents are making me see a shrink now .
you were <person> ' s doctor . ?
no , actually , she was referred to me . she was dr . <person> ' s patient .
they ' re screaming for starbursts .
later .
<person> .
i ' d never be able to live with mysel --
what did he do ?
he violated the school property and flouted the law .
take both men into custody before <person> and the feds could , and find out what they were going to tell-
-and why did i choose you for this ?
-- there ' s this one kid , we call him <person> on account of he ' s a mongoloid . he got out of his cage once and --
-- he ' s in a cage ? !
you snitch to noonan , then what ?
<person> . i got stronger allies .
you came here for relief , <person> . read your prescription .
this is . incredible ! this is astounding ! ! for the first time since menningers i feel free ! i knew coming up here was the right thing to do !
<person> ' t be retarded . we were doing research for our girlfriends .
oh , right . i forgot . that ' s a relief . so you ' ll leave the door open ?
kinkers never get tossed . never . so that was meant for you . <continued_utterance> a few of the guys that got tossed caught up with us again .
<person> ! is he -- - ?
we take it in during the day !
what are your rates here ?
stand up , <person> , or i ' ll beat you where you sit .
<person> , you stop it now ! <person> ' t you see he ' s got a hurt hand ?
you know - raise baby trout from eggs and then stock the rivers with them . <continued_utterance> entire place used to be a trout farm . seems like most everything used to be something else , doesn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> i you might be new but you seem to know what you ' re doing .
it surprises me more than it surprises you .
that ' s not gon na help .
take a couple bottles of bleach , pour it over the trunk .
seventy-five percent .
seventy-five percent ? that ' s not nearly good enough for me . i ' m extremely skeptical .
jesus , you alright ?
yeah . i . i fell asleep . i can ' t believe it . i --
what does <person> ' s father look like ?
a short guy . heavy set . balding .
it was an accident ! right ?
right ! you were holding the rock and he -- accidentally ran into it -- really hard -- with his head .
the bucks gon na stop right here . if my son doesn ' t know the six new england states , if he has trouble with geography , i won ' t stick it in his face . i ' ll help the little guy . i ' ll put him in the car and take him out there . i ' ll take him to maine for a big lobster dinner , go skiing in vermont , hot dogs at yankee stadium . i won ' t stare him down .
<person> ' t ever stare him down .
i hear you did time with old spook . <person> , he was a good egg . i used to run a lot of dope for him . <person> ' shame he got shivved .
i shivved him . <continued_utterance> better you hear it from me now than somebody else later .
hello . ? sully . ? sully , that you ?
who the fuck is it to you ?
why not ?
well . to be honest . i ' m really crazy about you and it ' s making me nervous and when i get nervous i ' m not myself and i ' m afraid i ' m going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure .
a car ' s got to come along sooner or later . when it does , we jack it .
how do we do that ?
is that what a good doctor would do ? how old are you , please ?
i am seventy-four years old .
<person> ?
we ' ve got a lot in common .
you ain ' t got no credit card but you got a lawyer . <person> talk me all you want . <person> ' t you read the sign ? it says .
what sign ? fuck the sign . i want my car .
relax , <person> . i ' m not her father . i just rent her a room .
she likes old movies like i do , that ' s ail . besides , she doesn ' t really know me . she thinks she does , but she doesn ' t . maybe it ' s because she ' s <person> and i ' m catholic .
i could shoot your cousin <person> .
why ?
<person> , all right . what ' s going on here ? there ' s rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to cuba . i ' m the press secretary . i can ' t do my job if i don ' t know what ' s going on . so what ' s going on ?

you ' re telling me you believe the guy ?
all i ' m saying is , we let <person> push us too hard , we ' re going to wind up looking stupid .
sir , perhaps curiosity has died . perhaps even courtesy has died , but i have come a long way and there are things i would like to know . young man why ? <continued_utterance> because i shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your world .
we have no government . time traveller you must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws . <continued_utterance> there are no laws . time traveller how do you get your food and clothing ?
this is j . d . he ' s a student . we ' re just givin ' him a ride to . to here . <person> said we could bring him here and then he ' d have to go . and that ' s what he ' s doin ' . he ' s goin ' . <person> ' t you , j . d . ?

i ' ll bet i look great -- give me the film .
i ' m choking on it . <continued_utterance> <person> ? ummm . do you want me to come with you ?

this is commandante cinco . they all shake hands . <continued_utterance> today we took <person> . <person> is about to fall , and masaya . and next week we could be in managua but it is still possible to lose . in the last days of our final offensive the people of nicaragua must know that rafael is alive and well .
<person> un fotografia .

according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls won ' t rest in peace .

i think it is .
would you like to know how i handle a situation like that . ?

i ' m trying to help .
you ' re worried about your college applications .
i ' m not applying to college .
so , then , do we meekly go back to work and say nothing ? it sounds as though nourish and his realists are preparing to sabotage the trout farm . before you know it , they ' ll be planning to assassinate game designers .

i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process . not only physical , but also psychological .
i ' d like to bring you up to washington , walk you around our side of things , and share some of the information we ' ve been able to develop on your cartels .

you ' re the last person who should be whining about being a `` crew '' .
how do you figure that ?
<person> .
<person> ' t matter . they ' re all the same : dead weight . <person> ' t make a decision , can ' t walk because of their shoes , can ' t work because of their fingernails . make my skin crawl !
you guys must know something nobody else knows . if those are my plans , it ' s the first i ' ve heard of it .
would you care to put that in writing ?
a tooth .
stop ! <person> !
seven-o-five . first group off .

unbearable , i ' d imagine .
i guess everything we ' ve got to lose is already gone anyway .
when i see an opening .
that path she was talking about winds through these falls . what do you think ?
and you met <person> how ?
just dumb luck . i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me . i went home that night , shaved my beard , and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back .
leave me alone ! he ' s going to kill me ! !
why didn ' t you tell me ? why wasn ' t it in our files ?
so much for anticipating the unforeseen . <continued_utterance> had you .
no you didn ' t .

and what do you think ? am i evil ?
i ' ll be around .

it ' s the woman .
i thought you said it was a virus ?
<person> , get out ! get up on your roof or someplace ! we found out what ' s been killing people ! they ' re under the ground !
what ' s under the ground ? we ' re not getting up on the roof . <person> shelter ' s the best . <person> that since i was a kid .
that ' s impossible , man ! <person> , <person> , out of the john where i can see you !

i need you on this , <person> --
you don ' t mulder -- you ' ve never needed me . i ' ve only held you back . i ' ve got to go .

i don ' t know , you wandered in ten minutes ago and put your head down . i told you we were closing . <continued_utterance> want some coffee ?
huh ? <continued_utterance> you alright ?
i do ? i mean , yeah , i do .
i have to admit , i am so totally turned on . we should do it . now .
because she ' s royalty and you ' re scum ?
where ' s everybody going ?
before the divorce . my father used to take me here . fire spotting was his summer job . <continued_utterance> from here he proved to me the earth isn ' t flat . on rainy days , we ' d be above the clouds .
what would you do up here ?
well , closer , maybe . but no . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
it ' s angry , sort of bitter .
thank you , <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> ! <continued_utterance> they have no idea we ' re coming .
not having scruples , are you , <person> ?
this time they ' re right . who are you ?
un periodista .
<person> is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?
she knew exactly where you were staying , which you neglected to tell me , your own brother .
what ' s up is that hunk of shit chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up .
and we found evidence of a banana in the transmission .
have you got him ?
yes .
well , first you pick your place , see , then i ' d just sit back and watch it for awhile . <person> got ta wait for just the right moment , which is something you know instinctively , that can ' t be taught . then i ' d waltz on in . <continued_utterance> and i ' d say , `` alright , ladies and gentlemen , let ' s see who ' ll win the prize for keepin ' their cool . <person> says everybody lie down on the floor . if nobody loses their head , then nobody loses their head . you sir . you do the honors . just empty that cash into this bag and you ' ll have an amazing story to tell all your friends . if not , you ' ll have a tag on your toe . you decide . `` then i ' d split . <person> .
my gosh , you sure gentlemanly about it .
i can ' t help it . he gives me the creeps . i mean why was <person> so scared of him ? she ' s not that way . i think he did something .
<person> , he got her busted for possession .
in vino veritas .
<person> quod agis .
well , that was refreshing . how ' d you sleep ?
not that well . i think i was over- tired .
<person> , no . <person> was switching to a whole life policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam . and failed to make his last payment . so his <person> lapsed . so it ' s value is null and void . now he did have a pension account , worth another <number> thousand .
well , oh .
<person> .
<person> ?
i got ta go . i ' m sorry --
where do you have to go ?
why ?
probably because it sounds scary .

architect , yeah . <continued_utterance> no , it ' s not the money . <person> , yeah , that ' s good , but it ' s the freedom i ' m talking about . <person> , this guy has to have a job he could do anywhere . that way we could just up and leave at the drop of a hat .

why don ' t you take a long walk off a short pier ?
no , i . i just wanted to . <person> said people are talking about what happened . last night .
oh <person> , champagne completely overwhelms my senses . i always feel the better for it when i abstain . all i remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking . i don ' t even know how i got home . i don ' t remember a thing .
i don ' t feature <person> for it .
how ' s that ? how many times has he been in here , busted you up ?
i don ' t know . eight months ago i stop hearing from my people . no explanation , just silence . so i stay and i wait like i was told . soon i ' m in so far , they ' d kill me if i left . now every day i get farther and farther away from what i was . i ' m like you said , a criminal .
i ' m busted up for you , but <person> , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn ' t lift a finger .
she loves to be held by strangers ! hey , she ' s soaking wet hmm , no i think it ' s number <number> . want me to give you a hand changing her ?
oh no , don ' t worry , i ' m used to it . well , so long , mrs . <person> .

yeah .
<person> , <person> , you know who that is ?
should i ?
what ?
it ' s interesting .
dinner . with <person> and his new girl .

that ' s the way i planned it .
<person> , <person> , i ' m closing my practice . most of my patients are on the west side but i have one case i ' d like to refer you .
`` <person> will '' is obviously not a big factor in this little world of ours .
it ' s like real life - there ' s just enough to make it interesting .
i think . something stung me .
it must . <continued_utterance> scully .
then talk to your brother , goddamn it . the two of you don ' t need any advice to get into trouble .
what ' s gotten into you ? <continued_utterance> oh , still sore about this .
i ' m sorry .

you know what this is , you know what we ' re seeing here ? we ' re seeing the end of western civilization as we know it .
this is so sad .
two . <person> not stirred . <continued_utterance> what the hell are you doing here ?
someone wants to kill me , i ' d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
what ?
i ' m sorry . i ' m probably wrong . i assumed that night after the raid was the first time you two fucked , but obviously it ' s been going on longer than that .
no provisions , nothing . my clients testimony for his immunity .
may-i be frank , <person> ? i suspect your political power as much as i respect it . i don ' t know why mr . <person> has so many faceless allies in city hall , and i don ' t care . the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here .

i got the shanks .
<person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> ?

i once knew a man . one of the <person>s of <person> . my native province . when the good <person> was about your age , he fell in love with a visitor from paris . a breathtaking girl of seventeen . she was more than beautiful , d ' <person> . she was . intoxicating . and this man , the poor idiot , he married her .
<person> ' t worry about it . you want anything ?

a rumor - from an anonymous source -
- that <person> may be involved with <person> and <person> , and the missing <person> .
<person> .
i ' m waggling .
the mexicans would love it . they ' re dying for a little order down there . they need direction .
they need leadership .
hello ?
hello , <person> . <continued_utterance> do you like my tomb ? the museum financing fell out , so i thought your clients might be interested .
i thought it was but a legend .
i ' ve never been inside the vault before . it ' s said the tesseract was once held here .

<person> , you ' re the only one who can help <person> now . you must go to the allfather and convince him to change his mind !
and if i do , then what ? i love <person> more dearly than any of you , but you know what he is . he ' s arrogant . he ' s reckless . he ' s dangerous . you saw how he was today . is that what <person> needs from its king ?
the democrat , sir . by nine points .
maybe it ' s time to publish that story about his sex life . even things up . a close race is always better for our tv ratings .
i will call the police right now if i don ' t start getting some answers .
<person> please .
did she tell you where she was callin from ?
no , but my guess is they're headed west , so probly texas . their money must be runnin low . i dont think <person> had much to begin with , if any , and <person> took the six hundred she had saved in the cherokee thrift .

easier than that , buddy . i ' ll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend <person> continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing . pretty soon everyone ' s involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
including rape , pillage , murder .
it doesn ' t mean anything .
why would they do all that if we weren ' t ?
that ' s stupid .

the shop around the corner is a true new york treasure .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> hi ! where you going ?
just to . town . buy some . , <person> .
<person> dusted <person> , dusted him from the driver ' s seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands . <person> looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car . it ' s a known fact out here that he ' s petrified of driving . his parents were killed in a car wreck .
that ' s not very solid .
about an hour and a half , because that ' s all the longer i ' ve been gone .
actually , it ' s been about three hours . you ' re the one thinks that car ' s so damn fancy . what you expect but fancy damn prices ?
<person> , this is an elementary school .
elementary school ? i thought you were <person> ?
actually , i picked up a whole bunch of new clients at the open . lotta guys on the tour said if i could do that much for you , imagine what i could do for them .
there ' s a lotta head cases out there , you could make a bundle .
and how ' d that go ? did he give you an earful for disturbing his ninety ninth viewing of <person> ?
oh della . <person> is always charming . at least to me .
her own people start to suspect her , it creates discord from within . the warriors don ' t know who to trust , they start infighting , and <person> loses his support . <person> nods , impressed . <continued_utterance> her oil pan is shot .
<person> . what ' s the fort laramie treaty ?
i get it now . you and me . we ' re dead .
<person> ?

what ?
<person> white to appreciate good grass .
<person> is missing , presumed dead . <person> is our sole suspect .
<person> , can we not get into this now please ?
i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , <person> with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack .
<person> .
there is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball .
what do you want ?
nothing , nothing .
<person> isn ' t so hard to fathom . what ' s clever is getting someone else to pay for it .
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune .
<person> to me , fella .
no , no , you listen to me . all i wanted in this case is an even shake . you rushed me into court in five days . my star witness disappears , i can ' t get a continuance , and i don ' t give a damn . i ' m going up there and i ' m going to try it . let the jury decide . they told me sweeney he ' s a hard- ass , he ' s a defendant ' s judge . i don ' t care . i said , the hell with it . the hell with it . i ' ll take my chances he ' ll be fair .
' course my son did work three summers as a baggage handler and freight loader . with those qualifications , why should i doubt his ability to run an airline ?
fine , if you don ' t want us , stay with the scum in present management -- dedicated to running you and bluestar into the ground .
i ' m gon na be en route with a team shortly to relieve you . just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives . and x ? you done yourself proud helping those people today . xander tussles the hair of the captain ' s <person> .
thanks .
or why we ordered it .
we ordered it because another game character told you to . that ' s a clue we can ' t ignore . but that ' s just basic games playing .
not money . but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner . it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution .
we ' re not proceeding anywhere together .
yes , sheeni , thanksgiving . i ' ll be coming for dinner , of course .
<person> ' t even think it , <person> . you know my parents don ' t approve of you .
you ' re kidding . <person> ' t you shoot him or something ?
i don ' t really like guns . you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive .
you can !
-- and what are you doing taking him to play pool in the middle of the night , and then telling him to lie to me about it ?
i so hope i didn ' t startle you . i thought you might like some cold lemonade .
uh . thank you .

<person> . your secret weapon right ? i mean , i know j . <person> is a slanted fuck , but traditionally `vicious fags ' don ' t make the best major case witnesses . i ' m worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility .
she ' s waiting for you . <continued_utterance> we ' re sinking .
help me . we have to seal it .
i wasn ' t planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen .
what did you find ?
you been a bad girl , <person> . you took my heart from your mama , didn ' t ya ? you betrayed her ! like you did me . there ain ' t no forgivin ' ya , girl !
oh no ! oh please forgive me , <person> !
i told him that , <person> , but he insists on talking to you . he says it ' s an emergency .
put him through .
you want me to stay , boss ?
i need to be alone .
officer . <continued_utterance> besides bat-shit insanity , is there anything else about her that rings true ?
heard an argument , loud , maybe a minute or two , then silence .
i ' m usually too tired to be .
<person> . it ' s because you ain ' t got the baby batter in your brain any more . that ' ll fuck with your head , that stuff will .
you don ' t need an eagle . <person> wins , par ties . hit the lay up . hole a wedge for goddamn eagle .
this is everything , ain ' t it ? this is the choice it comes down to . this is our immortality .
well , we ' ll ask around . let you know if we hear of anything .
thanks . god , i hope they ' re not screwed up . i might have to bag the whole semester . <person> , sorry to bother you .
who ?
<person> palm , your girlfriend . god knows you spend enough fucking time with her . the guys laugh .
i just can ' t go back in front of judge <person> , it won ' t look good , trust me .
so maybe you ' ll get a different judge .
' <person> , ' dipshit .
<person> ' t call him a dipshit .
whatll it be like in california , sailor , do you think ? i hear it dont rain much there .
you got about six more big states to go before we find out .
hi sport .
nice to see you again mr . <person> .
okay , what ' s the matter ?
you notice my new jumper ? <continued_utterance> my friends buy me clothes , so i don ' t look like trash .
that isn ' t a satellite crash . they would have hauled the wreckage away , not built a city around it .
you ' re going to need this .
ms . <person> -- you work at a school for mutants in westchester , new york . can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants ?
math . history . science . <person> .
you remember that boy who lost his mind , <person> ? you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark . he wouldn ' t miss a one . make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe . he would pick up a brick and say `` go on in there brick and hit somebody '' and it would find its mark .
i was afraid to go to <person> because of him .
the bedroom is through here . you have two bathrooms , here and here . there is a small kitchen which . <continued_utterance> . you may not need . there are two televisions , video , dvd , radio , hi fi sound system . and . <continued_utterance> is everything satisfactory ?
yes . thank you .
i don ' t know why we didn ' t quit . just the smell of that room brought back the memories . i hated it , it was like a form of self-abuse .
were you guys that bad ?
how are your hands ?
starting to burn .
<person> ?
i never miss florida in the rainy season .
i hardly ever think about sex .
really ? i think about it all the time . it ' s the hormones at work , you know .
what ?
indictments . <person> time . whole nine .
<person> ' t that general salazar ?
yeah .
oh my god , you ' re the greatest !
but you must buy your ticket and give your word that you ' ll go home . this is all about trust again , <person> . we must have trust .
the day wasn ' t so bad . we all got through it all right . blind man keep it .
<person> ' t over yet . <person> is part of day ; separate , but equal . <person> is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
what difference can that make . ? all right . <continued_utterance> uh . the admitting nurse .
what did she do ?
she don ' t know you live in a winnebago .
well , she sure as hell knows i ain ' t taking her to no doral for massages and mimosas all weekend . i got ta do something with my life . <continued_utterance> i got ta rise to a level worthy of the women that think i ' m a joke .
yes .
-out again . <continued_utterance> but if we see another mother from <person> ' s school , me name is <person> . i always wanted to be a <person> .
come on , <person> , we could have a great week up in vermont .
i see what you mean . but wednesday we ' ve got to be back in new york .
of course not .
i mean . it ' s a disaster , <person> !
i watched your simulation , mr . <person> . <person> impressive . you know , you ' re the only one to ever go up against <person> <number> . <number> who is still alive .
only because i got pulled out early .
you hate gambling .
that ' s right . i do , don ' t i ?
sure she is . that ' s why she got an unlisted number and you haven ' t heard squat from her in a dozen years . oh you ' re good , ted . you ' re a real piece of work .
<person> , let ' s forget it . <person> ' s forget the whole thing .
<person> .
what ?
<person> , i kind of thought you were gon na work that out .
well , i did work it out -- more or less --
maybe there ' s a way you can get your memory back .
how ? what ? where ? when ?
i want you to trust me .
maybe someday .
how long has he been with you ?
since the kidnapping . why do you ask ?
there ' s no reasoning with him .
<person> waterhole ' s <person> . we could be there by mid-morning .
getting out won ' t be your problem . it ' ll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere .
what does that mean ? !
did you guys used to date ? that ' s it , right ? he broke your heart and you ' re still soft on him . that ' s funny , it don ' t seem to fit with a tough broad like you . <continued_utterance> where are you going ?
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .
<person> --
but i just --
you ' ve got no jurisdiction .
you got no know-how . about indian way . or about jack <person> for that matter .
it ' s so nice to have friends like you , <person> .
what is it , <person> ? your balls need scratching ?
the world is not driven by discounts , believe me . i ' ve been in business forever . i started helping my mother here after school when i was six years old . i used to watch her , and it wasn ' t that she was selling books , it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be . when you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does . i guess i ' ve gotten carried away .
you have , and you ' ve made me feel .
you don ' t have to do that .
yes , i do . you ' re right . i can ' t just let him go free . besides , i can help you from the inside .
we are emissaries of her majesty , <person> , of the land of coshairm .
<person> ?
<person> . a romantic and tragic drink .
oh yes , i remember you .
maybe i didn ' t add enough money --
no . it ' s wonderful . it ' s something you ' d see on the wall of a steak-house in hell , but it ' s wonderful . sign it .
<person> , please .
. but what if i ' m not ? what if she died in terror and betrayal and some part of her can ' t move on while that ' s unresolved . <person> ' t you just . <continued_utterance> wow . <person> walks past him toward the parking lot .
oh . well . it was the last one .
the last one ?
so that was it ? one bump in the road and you gave up ?
i also called <continued_utterance> they told me they don ' t help out stalkers . <person> , maybe they ' re right , it ' s been a long time .
the beauty of existenz is that it changes every time you play it . it adapts to the individuals who are actually playing it . the result is that you have to play the game to find out why you ' re playing the game .
but that ' s kind of cheating , isn ' t it ? not to say confusing .
<person> ' t tell me . not the slightest difference ? birdie can ' t bring herself to answer . kathleen how could that be ? all this publicity and not one bit of difference ? oh birdie , what am i going to do ? what would mom have done ?
let ' s ask her . <continued_utterance> cecilia , what should we do ?
so have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker ?
in fact i have . i saw him and his lady leave .
now , calm down . we were just havin ' a little fun .
<person> like you ' ve got a real fucked up idea of fun . now turn around . <continued_utterance> just for the future , when a woman ' s crying like that , she ' s not having any fun !
<person> up <person> ! <person> ?
<person> .
can we just get back to <person> ?
the quartet is part of the bit about <person> . the quartet was in my file , along with every other thing i had done since high school , see ? aliases , middle- men . they knew me better than i did . they knew all of us .
i worked juvenile in dade county for three years . we had a missing persons on <person> for two weeks . maybe a year ago . the family kept it out of the papers .
that would make it about the time of her old man ' s suicide . you don ' t think that could explain some erratic behavior ?
<person> . it ' s because you ain ' t got the baby batter in your brain any more . that ' ll fuck with your head , that stuff will .
huh .
what ? ! what about him ? !
just the look on his face when you . . it ' s not funny .
so <person> and sandra <person> were half- sisters .
and the other girl , <person> . <person> ' s niece .
i have the documents , the landing authorizations , the security passes .
<person> is suspicious . we are moving sooner , tonight . we understand each other ?
you don ' t remember ?
when she said it , there was something familiar . but no .
even when you infuriate me , i still want to kiss you .
but you never do .
<person> , i love the smell of a woman .
my step-father ' s going to tear you apart .
like what ?
telling when people have done something wrong ?
let me have one of those cigars . <person> nice in here . you run it ?
<person> , owner-operator .
thanks .
no thanks .
<person> but just to wrestle . my old coach thought i could get a scholarship .
<person> , i hear you ' re pretty good . so why ' d you quit ? <continued_utterance> you don ' t have to tell me . it ' s alright . <continued_utterance> do you like tacos ?
this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
turn the car around .
<person> here is ship ' s cook .
if you want to keep all your fingers , stay the hell out of my galley unless you ' re invited .
congratulations , <person> . <continued_utterance> to the first letac engineer to go into production on prototypes .
as long as you keep overpaying me , i ' ll be the first to go into production on three , and four , as well . <continued_utterance> mr . <person> , i could have <number> of them ready by tomorrow .
no . too many republicans in this town . they hear my wife ' s working for the democrats , they ' ll take their cars someplace else to be fixed . bad idea . no .
oh , <person> ! oh , ricky-y-y ! please let me come down and work at the club !

the back-up does the same thing .
<person> ! <person> mio ! i can ' t believe it ! how are you ?
good good . how you doin ' ?
you didn ' t have to .
i wanted to . you were kind to take us in last night . <person> , i needed something to do . i was so angry with your brother . he ' s so . agaanisish !
<person> , i don ' t believe this !
stand up .
they tell me you ' re an american agent .
what are you talking about ?
i ' m telling you , she doesn ' t know shit .
she knows <person> .
aw , come , come , come --
no , they won ' t - honestly .
where did you get this ?
the man gave it to me .
it ' s not easy to do what you did . you made us all look like a bunch of mall cops . that ' s hurtful . <continued_utterance> the men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals , and in my experience , it takes someone who ' s received similar training to do what you did to them . would you like to tell me where you received your training ? <continued_utterance> pakistan ? chechnya ? afghanistan ? then again , you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type . what was it , south africa ? <continued_utterance> certain groups pay well for a good mercenary . especially hydra . <person> waits for a response , but gets none . <continued_utterance> who are you ?
just a man .
the trees . the trees . they break . laura you have to hide the diary , <person> . you made me write it all down . he doesn ' t know about you . you ' ll be safe . <continued_utterance> you ' re not <person> are you , <person> ? if you are , you can kill me right now . kill me right now , if you are .
<person> , no , i ' m not . i ' m not <person> . poor <person> . i wish i could help you .
men call it justice .
are you surprised ?
who knows ? fog , night .
they ' d never sail this close to the shore .
the two in alaska . just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time ? still tinkering with <person> ?
what do you want with him ? <person> smiles now , tapping his metal helmet .
hey , you know what ? can i be honest with you ? right now i ' m not all that interested in how you ' re messed up ' cause you didn ' t get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday . what i ' m interested in is how i can keep from getting dead . and listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasn ' t good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a kennedy doesn ' t do a damn thing to help keep me alive . so do me a favor ; either shut up , or . just shut up . <person> isn ' t sure what to say .
<person> .
this guy must be in the ' tard squad . hey , buddy , come here , i think i know where your ball is .

because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else .
you know . i hate being called the brilliant one . the ruthless one . they guy who does the dirty work . the one everybody ' s afraid of . <continued_utterance> i hate it . i ' m not smart , you know . and i ' m not so ruthless .
a basic kill . <person> was a drifter and nobody knew her . my boys have been all over this . it ' s a dead end .

this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
i don ' t even know if i should be doing this . it ' s a very expensive car .
it ' s your car . these are all your cars .
i ' ve eaten enough breadsticks to turn into a pretzel .
<person> , tell me about the surprise .
<person> away from me !
now , what ' s this ?
so you ' re going to offer her a job ?
why not ? what else has she got to do ?
i ' m surprised you ' d want help from anybody who fights for the pink team .
i ' m asking you to help me , man . i got word yesterday that i did really well on those tests -- but that ' s not enough . i ' ve got to cheat and lie -- but i don ' t care : this is my one chance to get out of here !
<person> is a hard word to spell . how do you spell it ? i-t . now take this credit card and put it through the machine , zip zip . <continued_utterance> so you ' re fine .
<person> .

' how ' s that possible ? the clock ' s ticking boys .
<person> didn ' t sneak back in , right ? he ' s still at the other hospital ?

you wanted to play my game , didn ' t you ?

someone with your accent should never be allowed to say `jew ' again .
some-motherfucker-took-my-fucking- pictures-i-don ' t-fucking-know-what- happened ! fuck me !
<person> ' t you ship the film to new york ?

hey . <person> to me . <person> ' t blow me off . i ' m all packed , i ' m going back to london and i understand . you put me up for that other attorney ' s job , so you didn ' t have to fire me . a classy move , and your father would have done the same -- -
i think you two are engaged . <continued_utterance> i think <person> likes music . that harmonica song is lovely .
i ' m confessin that i love you .
<person> , wait , listen . burt do you have any more of those things ?
the bombs ? damn right i do .
<person> ?
how much they offering ?
so if the papers or noonan come sniffing around-
-we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal .
maybe it ain ' t coming .
then we go after him .
<person> sir . <person> -
. but because i am a just man , i ' ve decided to give mr . <person> what he deserves . <continued_utterance> mr . <person> will escort you to the plane .
long story .
<person> looked real skeezed this morning . like he was on a dope jag .
one guess .
how the hell ' d you get the beans all the way up top like that ?
<person> . i was making time with your girl . now i ' m scared to death and i learned my lesson . now can you go away ?
not before i settle with you , chickenshit !
what the hell were you doing ? you ' ve been gone for hours ! this damn kid ' s been crying the whole time . i ' ve got a lot better things to do with my time ! you ' re a real pain in the ass !
hey , how dare you speak to me like that ! you ' ve never spoken to me like that before .
she ' s not at that place you sent her ?
she snuck away . and we haven ' t seen her . she hasn ' t come home .
no . you ' ve always been crazy . this is just the first chance you ' ve had to really express yourself .
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty .
we have much in common . we both attended school in the united states , and both of our fathers are engineers .
i got into stereo equipment when i was a kid . some people don ' t notice the difference but it is very important to me .
then why did you ?
because he was worried about me .
tell them he was trying to save the young boy ' s life , and that he died heroically like the other firemen .
of what ?
give me a break .
monday night mechanics . tuesday pilates . wednesday spanish . thursday , i wish . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> face it , <person> . you ain ' t no suburban housewife . <continued_utterance> so you bought into the big lie , even tried to live it . who could blame you ? husband , kids , security , every woman ' s dream , but not yours , <person> . you know there ain ' t no such thing as security . <continued_utterance> but i ' m betting you didn ' t really know who you were until tonight . i reckon i know what you ' ve been dreaming about though , what you ' ve been aching for , through all these lonely , wasted years . blasting out of podunk without never looking back . feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers . doing all the things they told you you ain ' t supposed to do . taking what you want from life . and wasting anyone who stands in your way . right , <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t say you ain ' t thought about it . if it ' s in your blood , it ' s in your blood for all time . <continued_utterance> you had yourself fooled , <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , lady , you took my whole crew out with nothing but a bunch of them tools . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> you can ' t go back to your old life . no way . it ' s all over for that . <person> . <continued_utterance> hooking up with me ' s about the best chance you got . <continued_utterance> i bet you ' re on the outs with your old man . <continued_utterance> when we pick up your kids , we can waste him if you like . <continued_utterance> i can do it . or you can if you ' re ready .

i think i ' m going to throw up . i am .
let me guess . from the internet .
yes .
what ' s a word for `` an outsider , of sorts '' ?
trespasser .

because my sister is not a bank , you know ? i can ' t just show up and ask her for --
yeah , i don ' t know why but i always felt at home in the fronton .
<person> , uh , i ' ve been thinking about everything you told me .
<person> at that ! <person> ! come and get some , boy !

they ' re going to hit the taxi service . <continued_utterance> new york ' s <person> .
now you know how it feels . to be locked away , to wonder if they ' re coming for you , if anyone will ever come for you .
<person> will come .
it ' s giving me the jitters in the joints around my knees .
oh , i think i see a jijik and he ' s fuzzy and he ' s furry i haven ' t got a brain but i think i ought to worry !
i ' ll keep that in mind .
i see my date is here . and i think mr . <person> is ready to leave .
i don ' t know .
what do you think she wants ?
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i don ' t even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you ' re coming back . or if you ' re coming back .
we ' ll get through this , i promise . i ' ll make it up to you --
it ' s not .

i had a witness disappear on me .
that happens .
what ?
seance .
<person> . you wanted me to kill her .
a man doesn ' t always mean the things he says .
no -- i know it ' s not . but it ' s kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we ' d be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state . and that means i don ' t want anybody running out at <number> : <number> or <number> : <number> , or whenever the bus happens to come in that day . now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school ? does your husband work in the area ? do you --
oh -- no -- <person> . isn ' t `` on the scene . `` so to speak .

i ' m just joking , <person> . you know me . i pre-paid ten classes and only made it to two . if you are going i could use a ride . i ' d hate to miss another class .

five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle .

he was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side . i carried my bag the last four holes . i love ol ' <person> but i need you .
george ! you ' ve given a most lucid explanation and all that ! but i don ' t think i entirely understand .
<person> ! there are a lot of things in the world you don ' t understand , aren ' t there ?
ms . <person> , nurse-anesthetist ; dr . <person> , of course . <continued_utterance> <person> , the obstetrical nurse .
what did these people do when her heart stopped ?
and you ' re going to listen to him ?
he seemed to know what he was talking about .
right . <continued_utterance> these tape things -- do they go on the front or the back ?
how am i supposed to know . ?
anonymous . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been getting ninety-sixes my whole life . it ' s what they expect . after all this , i still haven ' t figured it out .
figured what out ?

it ' s a car . a little car .
what does that have to do with anything ?
i can ' t do that . i can ' t abandon my vehicle .

and other uses , no doubt .
abuses in your case . you destroyed my hydro-boat in less than seven minutes , as no doubt will be the case with this . <continued_utterance> <number> , my deputy assistant . i ' m grooming him to follow me .
i don ' t know . my friends are here . i like the scenery . i don ' t know .
i know , i know , but it ' s so . there ' s nothing to do here .
i ' d like to know what it is about me that i have to fall for tin men . what kind of character flaw do i have ?
i didn ' t want to have to come here . i wish that i didn ' t have to ever see you again . i ' ve gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me . i was going through life , sailing along , pretty good . doing okay , and i tried to get even with some crazy guy . and i ' m here .
no .
you put him down or don ' t bother coming back .
my wife died .
oh , i ' m sorry to hear that .
i come from canton , ohio .
i ' d like to ask you something . were you ever in an oxygen tent ?
our plane crashed . in the grand canyon . a big fiery explosion . we never made it to l . a . they needed dental records to identify us . and this place . this . actually . is .
then there must be a whole room , made completely of chocolate .
that ' s funny : you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
<person> to me ! i ' m a british secret service agent . and we have about two minutes before harmsway kills both of us .
i wouldn ' t do it .
you would not . ?
jesus . that scared the shit out of me . what are you so stressed about , <person> ?
i don ' t know . work . <person> .
what the hell are you talking about ?
<person> ' ve known you vultures would turn up .
well , that ' s it . <person> ' s going down . people go home , trade stories over dinner . they ' ll talk about the day , about the heat , laugh about something crazy it made them do . they ' ll kiss , sleep a few hours , then do it all over again .
the day wasn ' t so bad . we all got through it all right . blind man keep it .
who ' s your boss ?
my employer wishes to remain anonymous .
so what ' s it doing in tijuana ? <continued_utterance> let me ask you a hypothetical question : if <person> worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel , and he went out of power , would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ?
it could mean that , yes .
go ask if you can put your tongue in his mouth . i hear it works every time .
hi . <person> said to introduce myself . i ' m <person> , <person> ' s neurotic sister .
undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort .
considering this is your first time on a private jet , on which you are interviewing the world ' s most eligible bachelor , you are extremely cavalier .
like you , sweetheart . you and your daddy got the same mouth , eyes , ears , and nose . only difference is your color hair is like mine .
my daddy aint never killed nobody , has he , mama ?
hey , <person> -- heard you put a monster number up there .

nick , that was your father on the phone . he lost his job .

<person> , where ' d you get this ?
the c . i . a .
let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable .
and if it doesn ' t ? by cooperating now we ' re but beggars to our demise ! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all .
<person> , too .
oh , now ?
hey baby .
<person> . <continued_utterance> hey , my snakeskin jacket . thanks , baby . did i ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom ?
i had it all backwards . i had it all wrong .

what ' s the matter ?
i don ' t get it .
through , through his book .
what book is that ?
<person> . it ' s mine , motherfucker .
you must be mistaken .
it ' s not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i can ' t . i don ' t want to be alone . i need to know i ' m going to be taken care of .
you need a meal ticket is what you mean . some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
brian -- i got ta sit down .
sure -- let ' s go in my office .
trolls ?
relax . they only come out at night .

<person> is my friend .
<person> , i got lot ' s of friends .
i thought you came to break bread over a thousand days ?

. <person> ' s an unpolished gem , <person> , right out of the garbage . a half assed management being decimated by a price war they can ' t win . but the gates at laguardia alone can bail us out , it ' s worth <number> bucks a share if it ' s worth a dime ! they ' re ripe to fall .
mixed emotions , <person> : like <person> going off a cliff in my new maserati . men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines , fuel could go up , unions are killers .
it ' s a fortune box .
what ' s it say ?
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .
a portuguese boyfriend . <person> very `` cosmo . ``

that doesn ' t matter .
damn it , quit the bickering and give me a hand . wheel that fibrillator over here . <continued_utterance> palmer , turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face . childs , grab his shoulders .
you ' re going to have to sleep sometime .
. it ' s easy jack ! on settlement day , you endorse a check to <person> . then i send you your cut . <continued_utterance> . that ' s the bottom line . and nobody gets hurt .
. things are so bad , even the liars are complaining . and you ' re making money . so what gives ? what ' s the bottom line ?
i don ' t need one . i don ' t expect to win .

not at all , go right ahead . i ' ve got nothing to hide .
it ' s a collect call from a <person> collins in la paz , bolivia . that wouldn ' t happen to be your pilot friend , would it ? the one who never goes to south america ?

i ' ve always believed if done right , armed robbery doesn ' t have to be a totally unpleasant experience .
god . you ' re a real live outlaw !
<person> . <person> , <person> , you appear to possess-like many an aspiring writer before you , by the way-a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made . however , i ' think it ' s best if , for the moment at least . we abstain .
you ' re mad at me , aren ' t you ?
what do you mean what am i doin ' --
could you step away from the door please ?
<person> shoulder . looks painful .
. needs constant attention . <continued_utterance> enough ice for one day . <continued_utterance> you never take this off ?
well , if i had to guess , i ' d say it was some ol ' gal , some ol ' gal ' s husband . but it wasn ' t either one of those two . the tall one , the redhead , she left me a huge tip .
you didn ' t happen to notice what kind of car they were driving ?
there ' s a very weird reality- bleed-through effect happening here . i ' m not sure i get it .
what ' s in that needle ?

i ' ve been in prison , remember ?
why ? would you have answered it ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
<person> , you ' ve seen me . now give me a towel .

<person> ' s just here for a visit , <person> .
your friends at warren , <person> and <person> .
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff . three categories : you like me , you hate me , you want something from me . definitely third category .
it ' s your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
a fed , i shoulda known . who else would have this kind of budget ? now you ' re gon na hit me with the sales pitch .
i don ' t know if you ' re really delusional , and i really don ' t care at this point . i just care about her . i ' ve seen the way she looks at you .

<person> tucker , it don ' t matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he ' s just drooling and bleeding all over hisself , ' cause we love each other and we gon na run off , and i ' m gon na have his love child .
what kind of sick question is that ? i ' ll be watching you , young man . your money and power mean nothing here . nothing .
i guess you won ' t be wanting that <person> i sent you , then ?
but not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt .

i ' m very interested in this but is there someplace .
no , i ' m up to here with the coffee .
they got any good pool halls around here ?

excuse me .
hey , what are you doing in here ?
he can wait .
i can ' t , <person> . i ' ve got to run .
huh .
the most honest moment in a man ' s life is the five minutes after he ' s blown a load . that ' s a medical fact . and it ' s because you ' re no longer trying to get laid . you ' re actually thinking like a girl . they love that .
i ' ve helped you come out of your shell .
i really have to pee --
that what you do ?
yes . i try to keep my power .
what ?
if you don ' t tie up all the lose ends it ' ll never be over .
oh look . a wedding . how lovely .

you should have taken their offer . especially if you were unprepared .
i had a witness disappear on me .
why now , <person> ?
' <person> , <person> . i don ' t want to lose you . and for some reason i get the feelin ' you ' re about to split . permanently .
. well , see him ?
yeah , but he didn ' t see me .
so you ' re basically lying your ass off the whole time ? i couldn ' t do it .
well , think of it as playing a role . it ' s fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
nothing is the matter .
this isn ' t the way you dance .
<person> was a patriot . the men he ' s loyal to know their way around dallas . they blew that building to hide something . maybe something even they couldn ' t predict .
you ' re saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen . ?
<person> , you asked me to follow your girl around , and i did and i started to like her , and then i realized i just couldn ' t in good conscience do it .
do what ?
maybe what ?
maybe i can do something right .
why don ' t you just leave it alone ?
no , i got ta do something . i don ' t suppose you ' d card-
what the hell ' re we gon na do ?
wait till the liquor wears off . once they start getting headaches they ' ll lose interest .

oh my .
when word gets out that <person> was a cop , all hell will break lose . you ' ve got <number> hours . that ' s all i can give you . <number> hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department . <continued_utterance> tell you what . why don ' t you and that blonde what ' s-her-name come over for dinner sunday . how ' bout that .

<person> ' t you get what i ' m saying ?
last week ? i thought she just arrived two days ago . <continued_utterance> how long have you been here ?
she wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father .
i spend my whole life separating how i feel from how i think and what i see from what i say -- that ' s called journalism , isn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> it ' s disciplined . it civilized . it involves distinctions . i ' m great at distinctions . i wish i wasn ' t so good at them . sometimes i envy you -- you don ' t make any -- it ' s very convenient . the only time i don ' t worry about all those things is when i ' m with my daughter .
or when you ' re in bed .

he ' s dead .
but there ' s nothing we can do without defying <person> . <continued_utterance> no . stop there ! i know that look !

<person> think about it too long . you had enough ?
you ' re taking it to the next level . i always do that . i always take a relationship to the next level , and if it works okay i take it to the next level after that , until i can finally get to the level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave .
i ' m not going to stay long anyway . i already said that , didn ' t i . <person> . i ' m a total wreck . <continued_utterance> <person> , this woman is the most adorable creature i have ever come in contact with . if she turns out to be even as good-looking as a mailbox , i will be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her .

what happens it i come out ?
<person> .
have you been a patient of dr . <person> ' s for a long time ?

you love her , but you hate her ?
no , i hate loving her . i hate the kind of person she is . i hate having to tolerate the little `` games '' she plays . like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me . the bitch . she loved to play . she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it . she tortures me . but she ' s family . she ' s my little girl . my baby . i couldn ' t stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . no . not me . but you ? you got the killing in you , boy . how much you want ? a pause .
that ' s crazy . my husband is on trial for smuggling .
exactly , and this is how i know i ' m not getting into business with the u . s . government .
there is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside . thousands of life forms all screaming me me me and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms . it ' s terrifying and exhausting .
well , i like the countryside .
you , an army brat ? i don ' t see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
hell no . my dad was a straight up tin soldier . somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged . had a court martial and everything . the charges were total bullshit , so he was sure he ' d get his name cleared , but it didn ' t happen .
there is something that i always wanted to know . tell me , how did those boys die ?

oh my god . this man ' s tissue .
the rest will come .
you know by rights i could take this farm back today , don ' t you ? and i ' m a great believer in my rights .
not when you ' d use it to make war against other realms .

but can you kill a person ? can you do that , <person> ? can you kill me ? hide my body . contact the crazies . trust them to pay up . <person> over my now-decaying , fucking grotesque corpse . really expect them to hand over <number> mil cash ? <person> ' t you ever go to the fuckin ' movies ?

<person> , you ' ve stolen , vandalized , trespassed , and burned down <person> . all for one girl . if there ' s a misunderstanding , it ' s with your insight into females .

a piece of advice , mr . <person> : <person> ' t screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it ' s deadlier than uranium .

this is what you ' ve been conspiring to conceal ? a disease ?

as your father knew , things need to be sacrificed to the future .
where is he ?
well . if that ' s what you want to do , that ' s fine . but that ' s not what i ' m saying . you are a very important person to rudy , and you are the most important person to me . but i ' m saying that i can ' t take any more of this --
well --
<person> . it ' s <person> facade -- and what do you mean ' based on what you ' ve read ' ? you skimmed two chapters at <number> miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines .
i ' ve been doing this a long time , <person>p . i feel this kid in my bones .
the gentle and soothing lullaby of a piece of machinery so perfect --
i know where i ' ve heard it before . i know .
i forgot what real coffee tastes like .
you know , considering you ' ve only been out of prison for seven hours , you ' re readapting quite well . <person> , i didn ' t mean that the way it sounded . i meant .
maybe . we should just give them what they want ?
what ?
<person> ' t talk to me about character .
watch the tone fella .
yes , we call it a winch . and these are shrouds , and these are stays .
i thought this was supposed to be a vacation . why didn ' t you buy a nice big power boat ?
i ' m sorry , sir , that line seems to be disconnected .

professor .

hi .
hi , babe -- whaddya say you put on a sexy dress , and i take you out to dinner tonight ?
women like <person> don ' t come along very often .
in my case , they don ' t come along at all .
get out , frances . you can say you were hijacked .
it ' ll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat . <continued_utterance> you have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse .
i think they are deriving some good from the experience .
what are you doing here , <person> ? i expressly asked you not to come .
oh . well alright , you can be red if you want .
not now , <person> . i ' ve got some bad news .
<person> , take a look around you . what does everything you see have in common ?
er . i don ' t know . it ' s all owned by you , that ' s obvious . humm . everything ' s from a garage sale !

our home city , of course . but i should start with you . would you like some moonshine ? <continued_utterance> then what would you like ?
trust me , i understand . i just want to say something to you , <person> .
<person> ?
i beg your pardon ?
you know . . the guys who ride the short bus .

are you with me <person>dy ? <continued_utterance> i want you with me .
. you told the truth , you gave the money back . all things considered -- in this cockamamie world -- you ' re shooting par .
. you helped save the airline and the people at the airline are gon na remember you for it .
it ' s gone now .
because you have hope that you ' ll get better ?
one twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus . believe me , mr . x , i ' ve put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and i don ' t feel the urge to stop just yet . so think carefully before you tell me : is `` kiss my ass , hop- along '' your final answer ?
no .
you ' re not exactly pure <person> , you went after <person> with the same vengeance you went after me . look in the mirror before .
i ' m looking . and i sure don ' t like what i see .
what kinda trash talk is that ?
what it says on the bumper sticker up front . on that pickup .
well , i ' m glad . <person> my intrusiveness , but we do have to stick together you know .
who ' s that ?
ratings have never been our primary goal . i
but recent events have been
so ? was i right ?
there ' s one guy for sure ! a redhead , kind of young , disguised sort of like a college student .
now it makes sense , the whole neo bohemian , down with hypocrisy , fight the power crap . you ' re a poor little rich girl .
the ozone must be fully depleted on <person> .
for once , our son needs something we can not provide .
i can fight it a little longer .
really ?
really .
and it wasn ' t the first time . he had a thing about prostitutes .
my <person> ?
i can ' t kill , <person> . i can ' t kill anybody .
it ' s not like he ' s a young man , <person> . he ' s had time to live . it ' d be quick . i mean , he wouldn ' t even have to
i can understand if you ' re thinkin ' about it . i mean , in a way , you ' ve got something to go back for . i mean <person> and everything .
thelma , that is not an option .
hey <person> . how ' d you get down here ?
the window .
<person> , then we don ' t have deal .
<person> , then we don ' t have a deal .
i ' m in a dream .
. was the man at the restaurant ? <continued_utterance> sometimes the mind behaves as if it were in a dream . faces change , people become other people . the subconscious is a powerful thing . you treated <person> carelessly , didn ' t you , <person> ? your feeling of responsibility or guilt over <person> might have easily turned <person> into <person> . do you know what derangement is ?
<person> ! !
sshh . <person> back .
you think me strange ?
yeah . just a little .
sent it .
photographer ?
i don ' t know , but i am . she was there and then she was gone . i felt it .
<person> .
you ' ll never get away with it , <person> . too many people know .
who , mr . <person> ? the kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists ? the oliver stones of the world ? i ' ll publish their books , i ' ll make their movies , i ' ll put them on my tv shows ! they ' re my bellboys . they carry my luggage . <continued_utterance> now . get them in the airlock .
do you want me to carry your pack for you ? <person> blurts out emphatically .
no ! <continued_utterance> no , i ' ve got it .
is it a girl ?
it is a girl .
god , i didn ' t realize . i didn ' t know who you --
-- were with . `` i didn ' t know who you were with . ``
you ' re going to port into me ?
you wanted to play my game , didn ' t you ?
it ' s okay if you ' re not .
i am , really .
<person> --
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her . in my house .
what ' s that supposed to mean ? !
everybody knows why she went over <person> . you jibed the boat .
but it wasn ' t ! we got away ! we were walkin ' away !
they don ' t know that ! it was just you and me there . i ' ll say he raped me and you had to shoot him ! i mean , it ' s almost the truth !
' <person> i didn ' t ask him .
aw , shit , thelma , he ' s gon na kill you .
well , he better learn to own it . actions have consequences . it ' s not what happens here alice , it ' s what they take away with them .
you ' re still an idealist .
so what ' s the problem ?
how ' s it coming back there , <person> ?
it can ' t be . not <person> .
<person> believes it can happen to them .
x <number> . read .
go ahead , <person> .
no .
-- that you ' ve lost hold of -- well , not just your religious feeling , but lost hold of any kind of anchor , any kind of trust in anything . i mean no wonder you drift around so much . what could ever stop you ? how would you ever know if you had found the right thing ?
sir , there ' s something wrong . this one needs to rest .
there ' s no rest for them . move them along . move them along !
i am not a child .
you are acting like one !
<person> ' er up .
you got it .
some olives , the normal kind and also some of the little shrivelled black ones . a bottle of white wine .
<person> .
how was i ?
fast . <continued_utterance> i ' m basically a coward , russell , i hope you understand that . i hope we don ' t get shot .
not much . he was just a computer program . nothing more .
you didn ' t see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , didn ' t you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target .
i was just trying to make conversation .
where is <person> ?
you do ? boys , you ' re aiming low . you not only surprise , but you grieve me . <continued_utterance> why , anybody can have a brain . that ' s a very mediocre commodity . every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has a brain ! <continued_utterance> from the rock-bound coast of maine to the sun . oh - oh , no -- -- ah - well , be that as it may . back where i come from we have universities , seats of great learning -- where men go to become great thinkers . and when they come out , they think deep thoughts -- and with no more brains than you have . but ! they have one thing you haven ' t got ! a diploma ! <continued_utterance> therefore , by virtue of the authority vested in me by the universitatus committeeatum e plurbis unum , i hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of th . d .
th . d . ?
<person> ! !
i won ' t let you kill her !
but then you knew what he was like all along . maybe his killing <person> was a thing you had counted on .
but then it is better this way , don ' t you think ? no loose ends . <continued_utterance> what ?
yes , he threatened to kill my five year-old son . i was under the impression i would be meeting juan <person> .
no , this is not possible . and i thank you for coming down here , though i suspect it ' s been a pointless journey .
you don ' t say .
<person> , meet <person> .
. kids ?
three . you ? <person> ?
just keep looking at that beautiful sky .
what ?
should i be nervous for <person> ? `cause i am . i want to stop the fight before it even begins .
gentlemen , you ready ? you ready ? let ' s go to war !
i ' m not playing around . i forgot .
what else have you forgot ?
<person> , i couldn ' t resist . but you know . i do feel the urge to kill someone here .
who ?
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
that ' s right . and guess who ' s the new king of the unemployment line .
you ' ve reached a new low with this one . i can ' t believe you ' re crazy enough to use the room at the marquis .
why not ? you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary ? is jean-claude done yet ?
fine .
<person> , please don ' t .
a half hour across the bay . <person> air . do you good .
no , i . . i got an appointment uptown .
well , what ' s the big rush , thelma ? if we just give ' em some time , they ' ll come to us . ! oh christ . i ' m just not ready to go to jail yet . why don ' t you go out to the pool or something and i ' ll figure it out .
give me the keys .
me , too .
you look good . how are you ?
i am <person> twisp . i am alive . i am a breathing organism .
quit fooling around , <person> . this is your dad . is everything okay there ?
you look good . how are you ?
i ' m okay . i ' m fine .
considering you brought my mother into it , $ <number> . <number> .
<person> . you ' ll hear from my lawyers . <number> a . m . <person> night .
you know damn well who i mean .
i don ' t know . probably ignore her .
you say she didn ' t come back last night .
she ' s been sayin ' she was going to go to l . a . but i don ' t know . i mean all her clothes are still here . an ' she ' s missin ' her graduation . she should graduate . she ' s a smart girl . <person> nods . he makes a note in his pad .
<person> . it was stupid . you could have killed yourself .
<person> . everything just got messed up after that .
do you want me to destroy this one , too ? before it gestates ?
no . no . we need to try our vaccine on it .
you think now that <person> ' s dead , there ' s all that money there and i don ' t need you anymore , and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and . pop ! <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you think i would ' ve done it if i wanted to ? what can i do to make you relax , baby ?
you could give me my gun back .
i wouldn ' t know .
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas .
what are you going to do with your <continued_utterance> oh , that ' s fun .
it ' s not about being fun . it ' s about being smart . you take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you don ' t ever have to do anything again . ever . that ' s freedom . that ' s what i ' m talking about .
they chumped us , gloria , right from the start .
why ? you ask me , <person> had it pretty good already , nice job in a beautiful setting , popular , an active social life . he ' s gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you ' re describing .
sure .

oh , for <person> ' s sake .

<person> , you owed me that ' bread ' <number> weeks ago . now you tell me you want another week . that ' s <number> weeks , <person> . that ' s also <number> fingers , cause you and i know it ' s a finger a week <person> . so you got balls . <person> -- now you come here tomorrow and you talk to me real nice and maybe i don ' t take the other <number> fingers you owe me , you see ? tomorrow -- and <person> , don ' t make me come look for you , okay . have nice day . he hands the phone back to <person> . <person> got that ? -- have nice day . <continued_utterance> the nerva that piece of shit ! and look at you , you neanderthal -- don ' t you fuckin ' break pencils , you goombah !
<person> ? what are you , a faggot ? in my country a man don ' t pay we cut off his head .
i don ' t mind . if you think he can hold me .
oh he can hold you . he weighs two-hundred-and-thirty pounds .
where ' re you from ?
new york . ever been there ?
you be careful now , <person> .
<person> of a bitch !
<person> tuatha danu ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! i transformed them all !
you didn ' t transform them , <person> , you released them . that was noth- ing . now change me .
obviously you ' re going to call the boy after me !
after you ? i hired sylvia ! the baby ' ll be named after me !
<person> , i ' m as conniving as they come , but a sneak attack is just wrong .
he ' s right . and things are happening too fast . it smells like the bay of pigs all over again .
<person> .
<person> . yes . how are you today ?
these ' bandits ' are the queen ' s own bodyguards .
the queen ?
that ' s fine .
where are <person> and <person> ?
yeah , i am too . i know you ' re not , brian , but you ' re driving everybody crazy .
well , i -- i ' m just trying to do my best here -- and i ' m gettin ' it from all sides .
what ' s the matter , d ' <person> ? still hoping for your friends to ride to the rescue ?
my friends are dead .
she was small . most people don ' t know that . the shoulders are small . it looks so perfect . i bet it ' s the only time she wore it . that day . she must ' ve felt so . happy . <continued_utterance> it ' s feels unreal , like butterfly wings or . something . it must ' ve cost dr . <person> a lot .
i guess . <person> never tells <person> the truth about how much he pays for these things .
. i ' m sure you do .
but what can we do ? she don ' t know who ' s visiting her .
did you find something ?
no . i haven ' t .
<person> , right .
no , it is . <person> , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it ' s not because you ' re a space ranger , pal , it ' s because you ' re a toy ! you are his toy .
we must be in the florida keys . . . the overseas highway connects the islands to the mainland .
so there ' s no border , no customs . they can just drive anywhere they want . . . there ' s nothing to stop them . . .
<person> ?
<person> ' s got your wife and valiant . he took them to the acme factory,
what you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up <person> ' ass , eh ? do what i say or i quit .
<person> , okay .
so how does it feel ?
what ?
patronizing son-of-a-bitch ! i wanted to walk again .
and you still might . this report legitimizes we ' ve worked so hard for . we can raise funs now . it could change everything !
want me to get that ?
sure .
i ' m not interested . i ' ve already got a job .
you ' re an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary . you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you ' re not getting any younger .
are you a religious man , <person> ? <person> nods , `` no . `` <continued_utterance> good . because i ' m going to talk to you as a man . not as a man of the cloth .
<person> .
<person> , i ' m gon na choke on ' feel good ' .
why are you such a penis <person> . do you do it on purpose or can ' t you help it .
tell me about it . i got ta be honest , <person> , it ' s not a good time for me . my business is off and my step son wants to get <person> .
<person> ? isn ' t he too young ?
i don ' t know .
and if you did ?
<person> like <person> wasn ' t fast enough to outrun that load . what do you make of the damage ?
six rounds . <number> .
he ' s just a man .
you didn ' t see his face
that ' s not in delaware .
no .
maybe it ' s time to publish that story about his sex life . even things up . a close race is always better for our tv ratings .
consider him slimed , sir .
how is <person> ?
you ' re a genuine curiosity <person> jankowski . what am i to do with you ? . i threaten to throw you off a moving train , feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway . so i think - <person> ' s an educated man . for <person> to disobey me and shoot that horse , that horse must have been in pretty bad shape . perhaps bad enough to injure my <person> during the show . and so i think <person> jankowski might be a valuable person to have around .
can i take the car ?
sure honey , what ' s the hurry ?
i am <person> . and <person> must go .
<person> ?
<person> ' t deserve it ! ? ! i ' d have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level .
well , whatever you said to <person> , it was enough to get him to give <person> a black eye .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
for you to be getting this kind of heat , for what they have on you . it doesn ' t add up . <person> ' s got ' em running scared . and i ' ll tell you something else , you rush , you get careless .
come on the rest of you , sing ! belt it out like men ! !
what ' s wrong mr . <person> .
what if he asks where i got the money ?
tell ' em your father gave it to you .
i ' m not going .
the hell you say .
mr . <person> --
<person> .
-don ' t worry `how . ' why ? <continued_utterance> you ' re going after <person> yourself .
exposing the corrupt parts of the lapd will redeem the whole . i ' ll prove that police can police themselves-
why are you here ?

he wasn ' t able to make it .
he stood you up .
no thanks .
oh cripes . do you have change for a dollar ? all i have is these stupid <person>ese coins .

how long have you been in alaska ?
i donandiacute ; t remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?

i don ' t think your dad would like you picking me up .
yes .
and when he ' s around , do your knees feel as weak as water ?
nice work if you can get it , and you can get it if you try . any scotch left ?
<person> , here , i just put it away .
this is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
<person> asks about you . when are you going to do something to help him ?
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with <person> ?
oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ?
we created our own world together . <continued_utterance> where ' s brian ?
he went with you , didn ' t he ?
mr . president . the oas meeting starts in an hour . i haven ' t prepared at all . we can ' t expect --
-- we need this one , dean . the quarantine ' s legal if we get a mandate , otherwise it ' s an act of war in the eyes of the world . get me that vote . make it unanimous .
who is he ?
you ' ll never believe it .
what are you doing , <person> ?
you think you ' re so much smarter than me , don ' t you ?
. but because i am a just man , i ' ve decided to give mr . <person> what he deserves . <continued_utterance> mr . <person> will escort you to the plane .
thank you sir ! thank you !
<person> ' t give up ! <person> !
<person> !
i know . <person> ' t tell me what i already know . this thing ' s a bottomless pit . i don ' t know what to do . no matter how much money i pour into it .
i ' d rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble . ' course these days i don ' t have to worry about that . my husband got laid off at the mill , and they repossessed the car , so wherever i wan na go , i just have to hoof it , you know ?
it ' s a little late to call admissions .
is it a little late to call the chancellor ?
every day the sun comes up . says something about us .
says what , <person> ?
you getting anything ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll lock them in the car .
i ' ll take mine .
you two wanta happy snap ?
no happy snaps .
that happens .
i could subpoena him if i had a week .
you ' re going to drive me to an early grave : i ' m never going to make <person> .
<person> . if a person can ' t get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins , at least he ought to be able to choose his own name . . and i wan na be called <person> !
thought you two had bottled out .
as if .
<person> ' t tell me what my son feels ! he ' s coming with me and there isn ' t anything you can do about that .
then you can ' t have that commission .
he didn ' t give his name .
who ?
he left .
he left ? what do you mean ?
no . i ' d want a public phone .
well . the store at saltzburg . but you won ' t be going to saltzburg for a while .
your parents never wanted to interfere with your life , ted . they knew your mom and <person> loved you very much . they knew they did the right thing . but that doesn ' t mean they didn ' t watch you and miss you , from afar .
you mean they knew who i was ?
i didn ' t know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job .
me-ow .
<person> .
you ' re always taking his side .
no .
. i don ' t want anyone to have a crack at you .
then put somebody on who does !
what ' s seems to be the problem ?
how do you know ?
<person> agents wear like suits and goofy ties . and dresses like my mom wears to church . <person> on that one show .
<person> about weird .
i get dizzy spells . <person> . cold sweats . hot sweats . fever blisters . difficulty swallowing . difficulty breathing . <person> vision . involuntary trembling . dead hands . weak ankles . twitching . fainting spells . numb lips . do you think that ' s normal ?
he used all of you to get him on that boat . he couldn ' t get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man . the one man that could identify him .
this is all bullshit .
you dont feel you was a little hard on the guy , honey ?
i know youre thinkin that i got moren some of my mama in me ? well , i couldnt help it . <person> , i really couldnt . im sorry for that guy , but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket ? i near barfed . and them poor diseased puppies !
can you borrow some cash from your brother ?
um , yeah , but that would involve speaking to him .
<person> ' t you ? after today ?

<person> .
when <person> was dumped out there in the badlands , he was dropped on his back . our man made an effort to turn him over , onto his face . it ' s an old ind ' n belief that if a dead man is turned face down , his spirit won ' t leave . and in the killer ' s case , it won ' t come back and jump all over his shit . that ' s an ind ' n thing a white man wouldn ' t know . <continued_utterance> and that ' s the way it is . write it down . <continued_utterance> you laugh all you want , <person> . <person> tonight , i get my man .

i must concetrate my imagination . to creat a new . reality !
you ' re not dressed warmly enough .
i ' m sorry ?
that ' s probably fair to say .
so , then , do we meekly go back to work and say nothing ? it sounds as though nourish and his realists are preparing to sabotage the trout farm . before you know it , they ' ll be planning to assassinate game designers .
only by two weeks .
<person> even then ? like he couldn ' t wait to get started ?
you ' re gon na have to step back .

i think you ' ve had enough tea for today . <person> ' s get you out of here , <person> .
ja-shwa tsway . these are lips .

i ' ll just be a second . so what happened tonight at the office ?

how far are we from mexico ?
about two hundred and fifty miles .
no , i ' m warning you , <person> !
<person> ' t try it !
letting a lunatic like parker <person> loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . at some point , he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator . the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .
not if you ' re with him every step of the way .
what does that mean ?
i ' m still going to new york .
<person> , i could too . but . i don ' t know why i ' m even asking you this . it ' s just . we can ' t place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie . i don ' t know . i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable . if just one person would say .
<person> . nothing ' s impossible . you just don ' t shoot someone like that for no reason . maybe he was askin ' for it . <person> , somebody ' s husband probably got ol ' <person> .
who knows , baby ?
he was sittin there havin a beignet at the cafe du monde . do you think he saw us ?

well , it ' s -- it ' s someone she loves very much . someone she ' s been very kind to . someone she ' s taken care of in sickness .

<person> ! <person> ! we ' re busy !
are you crazy ! <continued_utterance> you all right , cupcake ?

excellent . but what i can do -- and only i can do this because you trust me don ' t you <person> ?
you know carpentry ?
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school .
he did . she ' s in the picture . i went over to look and she ' s gone . the table was set for one .
and that means he murdered his wife ?
six months from now , i ' m not going to care . are you ? we ' ll deal with it .
at least it will expose whether <person> has been overthrown . we ' ll know what we ' re dealing with .
um , ted , i need a moment with <person> -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom .
<person> , sure .
a small thing . nothing really .
does this offer include my partner ?
i know . come on . we got ta get off the reservation or we ' re dead .
<person> . it ' s a good day to die .
i didn ' t know that . <person> ' s still brown .
my turn . what ' s your favorite song ?
what-are they speaking ?
russian , i think . i don ' t know .
she looks like a moth , <person> .
a moth ?
you could grace our hallowed halls again , if , while you ' re here , you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
i ' d do that --
you ' ll see soon enough .
you promised me answers . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> b .
maybe he ' s fat .
i don ' t care about that .
no .
<person> -
but beef-witted is a little more than i can stand , not to mention unfair .
<person> .
hey , <person> .
hey , <person> . what ' d your mom say about skipping school today ?
so , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?
. i figured . i figured you ' d turn back . wes gets a slow boil on .
<person> won ' t cut it . <continued_utterance> survival means discipline and assimilation . there are no special cases here . now , get going . get up there . <continued_utterance> what are you blubbering about ?
i don ' t know .
<person> , you didn ' t walk up again ?
i found this great psychiatrist who abandoned me .
here , here , what ' s all this jabber- wapping when there ' s work to be done ? i know three shiftless farm hands that ' ll be out of a job before they know it !

i really loved that pizza too . `` <person> '' if you ' re ever in rosemont .
kids ? this is <person> . he has some bad news .
your mother ' s friend <person> had a heart attack in a bar in dallas . he ' s dead .
why are you unpacking ? you said we were just gon na take a nap .
oh , i don ' t know . i ' m just nervous . i got ta figure out what to do .
you don ' t care . i don ' t care either .
well . i ' m sorry you ' re havin ' all this trouble .
you knew this man didn ' t die at the bomb site before we got here .
i ' d been told as much .

i ' m a walking coincidence . i can ' t count ' em . no something ' s happening , <person> . i ' ve got to get to the bottom of it .

dividend . i figure i owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes .
you tell ' em , <person> . <continued_utterance> you know , i was thinkin ' , maybe we ought to open our own place . that ' s the real money . build it up , milk it for all it ' s worth , then sell it off for a bundle and <person> out of this burg with more money than <person> and ready to <person> like kings . <person> ' s you and me take a walk around town , <person> , <person> if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots .
i can ' t hardly believe it . it ' s working out just like you said , <person> . we ' re lootin ' this burg six ways through sunday .
this is about sex , not like . <person> , <person> ' s here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins . you want a muffin ?
if i can smoke it .
<person> street clothes . not all of our patients have to wear the green <person> gowns .

what was that , admiral ?
we ' ve been hailing the groznyy for the last hour , mr . secretary . the groznyy refuses to stop .
thank you .
i ' m not through with the witness , your honor . with all due respect if you are going to try my case for me i would appreciate it if you wouldn ' t lose it .
who the hell else would write such a thing ? <continued_utterance> and just how do you explain this ?
that ' s <person> .
<person> back out there , kid . remember to hit ' em hard .
what about you ? where are you going ?
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who can ' t stand that his son ' s become more successful than himself .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man ' s wallet .
nonsense . he ' s young , not blind .
mostly , he is absent . i ' ve barely seen his majesty since our wedding , and that was three months ago . whenever he ' s around me , he has nothing to say .
why is everybody up at sunrise ?
the sun is setting , <person> . youandiacute ; ve been asleep for nineteen hours .
what is it you want me to do ?
a small thing . nothing really .
you mean it ' s been moved ?
i mean the musketeers have been disbanded . <person> free to poke around for souvenirs .
unlimited .
from a dea standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds . and cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training .
now <person> , you tie palmer up . <continued_utterance> we ' re going to draw a little bit of everybody ' s blood .
what are you going to do ? drink it ?
<person> , i ' m sorry . i wanted to tell you .
why ?
i haven ' t been able to recall a single moment of that day . until now .
funerals aren ' t exactly memorable .
it is a distant castle , where a great king and queen will look after <person> and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule .
where is <person> ? how far is it ?
doctors orders .
i ' m glad you came . i ' ll see you in my office next month .
what ' s that ?
<person>h , just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the soviets ' ll do the same in cuba .
how are the hometown folks treating you , back in xenia ?
well , <person> . they ' ve been exceptionally supportive .
a <person> ? noooo .
<person> , a <person> . it was the guy who killed <person> ' s mother .
yes .
that ' s like twenty minutes from school !
oh , that was just loose talk . husband gettin ' pissed off . i don ' t want anybody dead .
<person> . you wanted me to kill her .
i developed it in my room . <person> , <person> ? !
<person> down . it wasn ' t your fault if somebody stole your stuff .
well , you be careful with that boy , <person> .
<person> aint a boy no more , mama .
<person> , mr . <person> .

i ' m a agent as well . kgb . i ' ve been undercover for over a year .
that ' s your death . that ' s what it looks like . that ' s what is always looks like .
<person> - for <person> ' s sake .
how ' s things , brian ?
fine .
tough break . <continued_utterance> you lose .
<person> . that puts an end to one of our differences . now , concerning you .
oh !
oh . how was <person> ?
when does the fence come ? mcmanus redfoot ? he never comes to see me . i have to go see him .
in california ? mcmanus yeah . it ' ll take a few days . me and <person>
then why you going out with him if he ' s a schlep ?
come on , <person> <continued_utterance> it ' s like that movie <continued_utterance> this one ' s almost thirty years old . it ' s about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love .
no , sir .
<person> ' s mosey over to the post office , i ' m expecting a letter any day .
a new extraterrestrial biological entity .
my god .
i want everyone thinking out the box for a second . what are we gon na do about mexico ? come on , guys . out of the box .
unlimited funds ?
<person> , honey . where are you ? you sound funny .
i am funny . i ' m real funny .
it was all i could get back . not as much as i promised . i ' m sorry .
no , this is good . thank you . this means i don ' t have to start from scratch .
you use your sleeve . they both smile at each other . <person> . woman <person> ?
i thought it was you .
in a previous life .
oh .
i can ' t . and i won ' t .
come on , we both like <person>dy . but this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top . it doesn ' t fit .
what is it ?
we didn ' t find anybody like that in the yard or the house .
no ! it will cave in !
it ' s the only way out .
way to go , <person> !
i ' d doing this !
and the jacket ?
over there . in the backseat of the .
well , that ' s more like it . now , state your business !
we want to see the wizard .
people know . it ' s time to stop .
i can handle my own affairs , <person> .
no fire tonight , son . too many riders out . <continued_utterance> who ' s that ?
it ' s deputy breakenridge .
<person> for you . now why don ' t you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want . you didn ' t go through all this for my benefit .
it ' s your lucky day . you just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy .
i ' ll get it .
<person> away from there .
today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .
perhaps <person> had a word with the man upstairs .
in a minute someone ' s going to come and stop me talking to you .
who ? there ' s no one around .
how about -- ?
when you look at architecture , try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism .
we can have it here next week .
is this your house ?
let me ask you a question : have you considered bankruptcy ? it ' s a viable option . there ' s no shame in it these days .
that ' s not how i do things .
-me . you want me to draw him off-
-you ' ve been drawing him off . and the more he sees you the less he ' ll think of anything other than getting you . now find <person> and take him alive . do not let <person> get to him . as a potential major case witness against the lapd , <person> magdalena isn ' t just a powder- keg , he ' s an atom bomb .
we are going to try the case .
that ' s it . ? come on , guys . life is too short . you tell me if you ' re playing ' chicken , ' or you mean it . <person> : i don ' t think i ' m talking out of school , but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand . and that ' s a lot of money . and if i may say , you haven ' t got the best of records .
<person> ' s claws and a bear ' s balls that ' s what her profile says .
well , she ' s running now , too . these fucking people like to run , don ' t --
then get out and close it behind you .
you know what you need , buddy buddy -- an optorectomy . that ' s when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum -- to change that shitty attitude of yours .
<person> , get real . what does she need with a guy like me ?
what was that ? all this time she ' s not good enough for you . now , suddenly , you ' re not good enough for her ? god , my work is never done . <continued_utterance> <person> , make the mistakes i did . i think i ' ll just be playing this hand myself .
where are you ?
torch it over there !
the planchette ?
this . <continued_utterance> we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs . <person> . what ' s her first name ?
i might do it wrong .
not possible . <continued_utterance> i love you , <person> . <continued_utterance> now ' s when you say something .
is he awake ?
i ' m afraid he ' s pretty worn out , poor kid .
i guess i went a little crazy , huh ?
no . you ' ve always been crazy . this is just the first chance you ' ve had to really express yourself .
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster . he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster . <continued_utterance> he says there ' s something wrong with <person> -- he ' s crazy , he says you stopped the inipi ceremony last night . ? <continued_utterance> but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you .
he knows me ?
the connection is , it did a head number on him . he ' s petrified of cars . <person> ' t drive . i ' ve known him all my life , and he ' s never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle . he rides passenger and he rides horses , and that ' s it . the man that shot <person> down was behind the wheel of a moving car .
that ' s not solid .
what ?
what is that doing there ?
thank you .
feels different doesn ' t it ?
soy formula .
oh , okay , i ' ll take the soy formula .
i ' m sure he did . and where is your young partner this day ?
working his first big job .
<person> you ' re right .
you bet your ass i ' m right . you don ' t go out with a loaded gun , you empty the barrels !
you ' re not okay . we ' re not okay .
i don ' t know .
<person> really could have called . he has to have gotten our message by now .
well , when he does call , i ' m gon na let him have it ! that sonofabitch is on the beaches of brazil proposing to the whole goddamn world . and we ' re here living in hell ! he ' s gon na get his ass on the next plane back here . <person> ' s over , <person>-baby , you better believe it .
i ' ve got the conference next week . i want you to feel safe .
i do , i do . i ' m sure i ' m just . how was your day ?
county . i was in for fraud .
you were waiting for a line-up then , too . what happened with that ?
well , how are you going to fix it ?
i didn ' t want to say anything in front of . mrs . <person> . he ' s already foundering .
yeah . okay . he did
and then what . he touched you ? did you maybe flirt a little .
<person> , really -- you know what <person> said she was gon na do to toto ? she said she was gon na --
now , <person> , dear , stop imagining things . you always get yourself into a fret over nothing .
what ?
when he finds out .
i know . <person> reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s . a . c . <person> ' s apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .
how deep does this go ?
i concede i bring out the worst in you , but let me help you not to say something you ' ll just torture yourself about for years to come . she starts to smile and he removes his hand . they look at each other . <continued_utterance> i hope you ' re better soon . it would be a shame to miss new york in the spring .
thank you for the daisies .
i . saw you in paris . <continued_utterance> where am i . ?
this is <person> .
so , who ' s the baby belong to ?
it ' s <person> ' s daughter .
aah !
aah !
nothing .
<person> ' t look like nothing .
<person> ' s over unless i get to see what you ' ve been working on after hours .
i haven ' t been working on anything .
what happened in those three .

do you really think so ?
no .
yeah . jogging . why the hell you think i ' m doing this ?
jesus . that scared the shit out of me . what are you so stressed about , <person> ?
are you drunk , <person> ?
i was until about an hour ago .

you live and learn . i realized the most important thing to me , above all , is trust .
<person> out to be a scoundrel , eh ? i saw that one coming .
like a chihuahua ?
those , too , but you know those little hairy ones ? those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth ?
my , you get turned on easily . <continued_utterance> oh , don ' t stop , <person> . we all have our hormones to deal with . girls are fortunate in that it doesn ' t show . for all the world knows , my vagina could be moist with desire as we speak .
is it ?
fill her up . there ' s a phone right over there .
<person> ' s get it over with .
what ' s wrong ?
stop .
they ' re playing at cbgb ' s down on bowery . <person> won ' t be back for awhile . you her mom ?
yes . who was playing ?
my name is not fritz - it is <person> .
<person> - i ' m <person> .
you ' d be shit out of luck if not for me . you saw what you saw because i led you to it . i ' m putting my ass on the line for you .
your ass ? i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters .
uh huh .
what ' s it about ?
sounds about right . never understood how a girl that wild got all a ' s . sure didn ' t get it from me . they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young . <person> wouldn ' t hear about it .
she never mentioned her father .
who is it ?
he says an old friend !
what ' d you expect ? a stick-up ? empty your safe ? i ' m about to disappear for good , and you ' re gon na fund my new life . you can ' t counter-punch out of this . arrest me and i snitch the world . i ' ll hold that over your head for the rest of your life . <person> on our deal and it won ' t matter if it ' s tomorrow or ten years from now . i ' ll fry you with that file . i ' m officially outta time now chief . call it .

<person> , if you ' re going to keep bitching , macready -- <person> ' s offered to take him up .
<person> . what ' s wrong ? what do you want ?
i can ' t find manolo .
i ' ll give you a lift , son . <person> hot to be walking . people die out here , y ' know . <person> continues walking . <continued_utterance> aw , you ' re not still upset about that love tap , are you ? if i meant you real trouble , i ' d have given it to you by now . get in , lad . come on . get in . <person> gets in . <continued_utterance> after you huffed off , <person> lied so bad , i got so pissed off , i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead . <person> i lost my cool like that . it ' s a funny thing , women .

how much time ?
time . bobby what time is it now ? <continued_utterance> twenty-after-ten .
during the time that you had him here , did you discover any particular habits of his , peculiarities , quirks , anything that might help me find him ?
it ' s all in the folder .
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know ?
maybe a little of both .
he called me again .
did you try whistling ?
<person> crossed a very dangerous man . he changed his appearance in order to vanish .
<person> .
what ' s this maybe , shmaybe , comes and goes ? friends tell me i don ' t have many years left for this sort of thing . i ought to know right now if --
<person> ! how are you ?
we know each other pretty well . so where ' s <person> ?
<person> ?
pham , we don ' t want to be stuck on a couple of canners . they better be fast .
<person> . a snake thing like that couldn ' t move too quick .
-- obviously .
i just wanted to tell you not to give up . sometimes you ' ve got to back into the teaching from somewhere else . <continued_utterance> what makes you volunteer ? want to know why i tutor reading ? <continued_utterance> because , growing up , books were my world .
<person> said you ' re <person> .
yes .
<person> , i ' m a criminal . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean for things to turn out like this . i always lived by a certain code . but then . i broke it .
for <person> ? <continued_utterance> what ' s he like ?
now they ' re going sideways ! <continued_utterance> now they ' re going in and out !
this ' ll bring him out of it .
<person> ' t they tell you ? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak . you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass , man .
<person> feels like it . ted grimaces and shifts in his seat . ted how the hell did you get here anyway ?
and he says . you ' ll fucking love this , he says , `` <person> , i am a great admirer of your work . ``
well , that ' s nice .
i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat .
sometimes , you just have to plunge into things . be reckless .
well ?
a car ' s got to come along sooner or later . when it does , we jack it .
what ' s the competition ?
one mystery store . sleuth , on <number> th and <person> . and a children ' s bookstore . the shop around the corner . been there forever .
mrs . <person> ? can i ask you a few questions --
-- go away . leave us alone .
this is mr . <person> in subscriptions ?
how come you ' re calling me from . ?
come back as soon as you can .
if <person> comes here , he won ' t believe that i am out doing the `` meals on wheels '' .
people know who i am , my every move , complete strangers know my name . even when there ' s no one around , i feel the eyes on me .
i was in the bank today . the federal on <person> . a clerk was talking about somebody named <person> messing with her baby . is that the stranger you ' re talking about ?
wa-shee is like . a dumpling . <person> tallow we put in stew . i think he was calling you chubby boy .
<person> . <continued_utterance> you ever see that car before ? <continued_utterance> who ' s it belong to ? <person> ignores him . ray studies her reaction . <continued_utterance> help me , <person> . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t see you today , <person> . <person> .
it ' s too early in the morning for me to be cordial . you got any coffee ?
i watched your simulation , mr . <person> . <person> impressive . you know , you ' re the only one to ever go up against <person> <number> . <number> who is still alive .
if they ' re injured , shoot them .
and the others , sir ?
<person> , i admit it was brief , but it was definitely love . crushes don ' t last twelve years .
<person> happened to <person> ?
but , <person> , i missed the plane .
<person> , but now i have to go .
what ? why ?
breaking and entering .
<person> , <person> . !
i know , i know . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m sorry i got so mad before . i just don ' t want him , you know -- terrified of `` telling , '' if there ' s --
what code ? the vehicular code ?
code of the streets , <person> . code of the streets .
<person> , i thought <person> was a tough businessman , but somebody ' s really taking him to the cleaners here .
not really . i ' d say that <person> is one of the most astute collectors around . he has a great eye and he only buys the best . like this rug for instance , a silk <person> , the finest of its kind . the day after he bought it in london , a dealer representing the saudi <person> offered him twice what he paid . it absolutely makes the room . see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa . although . i don ' t know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy . and it ' s a sacrilege having that pre-columbian pot in the center of the coffee table . some dope might use it as an ashtray .
<person> , you are such a crack up . you don ' t even like <person> . is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight .
this is about sex , not like . <person> , <person> ' s here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins . you want a muffin ?
. now , let me get this straight . two years you give me problems with your fuckin ' payoffs . now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars , you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed .
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .
so be it .
now ! we ' ll finish them together !
the food in italy is good .
yes .
my little brother . <person> approaches .
<person> ! <person> de <person> !
yeah .
i ' m sorry .
oh . well . that ' s all right . !
. i ' m kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts . it ' s a long and worthy story but i won ' t trouble you with it right now .
no . ever accept any of your <number> , <number> proposals ?
<number> , <number> . no .
<person> , that ' s more or less what the others said , too . out getting coffee . supposed to meet him here . picking up my grandma . ted turns and glares at him . dr . lalonde i ' m just saying . they sure made you look dumb . <person> . a couple big cracks of the neck .
<person> , do you remember <person> ?
what does that mean ?
it means she ' s insecure .
i think this place may be a little too large for us .
what are you talking about . this match box ?
<person> ' t you understand ? ! that thing didn ' t want to become a dog .
damn you , <person> ! you ' ve already got everybody half-hysterical around here .

<person> ! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i ' m gon na give you another hole to breathe out of .

i ' ve discovered something about <person> ' <number> maestro teaching tool i thought you should know . the harm done to the music students who used the device it was not by accident . the machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . <person> intended to hurt the kids using it .
maybe it does . <person> ' t patronize me <person> .
you and i are the same , <person> . we ' re smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running : love . a fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows .
careful , princess . you may be my step-daughter , but these are dangerous times and those are dangerous words . i weep for the suffering of my people , but the spirit of rebellion is alive in the city and if necessary i will crush it with every means at my disposal .
for the good of the people .

everyone has got ta be concerned about <person> conlon ' s bravery getting him into trouble here .
you found him ?
i think so .
what ' s your christmas like ?
my folks split my freshman year , so i spend the holidays racing between them . two trees . two turkey dinners . two sets of presents to return for store credit . so normally i can deal , but this year mom decided to rent a condo at the beach . which is like , what ? two hours away .

<person> . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
whats the name of it ?
<person> .
<person> ' s <person> ?
it ' s the official scout magazine . tells about what it means to be a scout , what kind of boy you need to be , and , oh , about merit badges and stuff like that .
i ' m honored , <person> , but i don ' t think i would be very popular with the other men . not after today .
i suppose not . your heart is set on being a musketeer . when i was your age , i too had dreams of joining the musketeers .
<person> , haven ' t you heard ? <person> ' s been arrested .

<person> ?
yeah .

doubt it . he ' s dead . the <person> out ' s a cemetery .
he said he didn ' t have pancakes .
i ' ll give you a clue . maple syrup was used .
<person> asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians .
if it ' s okay with you i ' m going to <person> ' s to do my homework .
' least you admit it .
<person> what , i ' m an opium fiend ? no , <person> , i just said i need it . i need something to keep me warm at night .
so we wait .
if they land --
your people ? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me . you and my father . he didn ' t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market .
your father .
no . but if there was one thing i learned in the army it was to be positive -- especially when you don ' t know what you ' re talking about . you ' ll excuse me , gentlemen , i ' m on k . p .
yes , sir !
all those people out there . it ' s a lot of pressure .
<person> ! you laugh in the face of pressure !
<person> ! something ' s terribly wrong . what ' s your guess ? !
it ' s the woman .
i ' <number> be sure to mention that to him . <continued_utterance> the first thing i learned on the job , know what it was ? how to spot a murderer . <person> ' s say you arrest three guys for the same killing . put them all in jail overnight . the next morning , whoever is sleeping is your man . if you ' re guilty , you know you ' re caught , you get some rest - let your guard down , you follow ?
no .
`` that this same child of honor and renown , this gallant <person> , this all praised knight , and your unthought-of <person> chance to meet . for every honor sitting on his helm , would they were multitudes , and on my head . my shames redoubled ! for the time will come . <continued_utterance> . that i shall make this northern youth exchange , his glorious deeds for my indignities . ``
would you be addressing me , sir ?
what do you think ?
do you have a condom ? <continued_utterance> it has to be in a safe place . a nice comfortable bed . with no threat of interruptions . and for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine , preferably french . i want a new condom . not one that ' s been riding around in your wallet for years . consumers rated them a while back . i suggest you get their top-rated brand . this may take some research in the library . i ' d appreciate a photocopy of the article . <person> , for supplementary protection , i want a name brand spermicide .
i mean , i know i haven ' t exactly been the most . decisive . guy . in the past . i don ' t know : i ' m tired of foolin ' around . and i love you .
i . i ' m totally . i don ' t know what to say .
how long have you been in paris ?
i arrived this morning .
just as i thought -- the goddamn cops are grilling mrs . <person> .
oh shit ! we sure as hell can ' t hand her the baby with an ass full of dope . right in front of the narcs ! <continued_utterance> what should we do ? i really got ta go .
but not a knife ?
i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . like on t . v .
teresa .
<person> ? <person> , a whole year .
what are you talking ? ! he ' s had two months training in those choppers !
four !
whoa ! take it easy . what ' s wrong ?
you ! everything ! the guy-
he ' s a cartoonist .
what about the other guy ?
all right , let ' s go , in the car . i ' m taking you down to the station .
oh , c ' mon , that ' s impossible -- you see i have a baby . i have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes , i can ' t go anywhere . i live right in this building -- let me go up to my apartment and i ' ll get you my license immediately . you can even come with me if you like .
what ' s that ?
he ' s been under a lot of pressure recently . he snapped . he had a nervous breakdown . it ' s the saddest thing i ' ve ever seen . <person> ' s be honest about it , nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars ' worth of aluminum siding free .
yes , but <person> ' s still a boy . he could be a great king . <continued_utterance> . if we only had more time .
for once , our son needs something we can not provide .
torch it over there !
the dogs ?
he came to see you ?
he ' s over at the house . we ' re doing a little training at <person> ' s . remember <person> ' s ? it ain ' t <person> ' s anymore .
<person> . `` cats in the cradle . ``
just kills me .
what do you mean ? you were there .
i know , but who was he ? where ' d he go ? it ' s like one minute there ' s a , a gun to my head and the next all the lights go out and he ' s gone , like a , like a-
how you doin ' , <person> ?
which way you headed ?
you first .
no way ! it was your idea . you go first .
you monster . how much for ?
one kiss . <continued_utterance> that smile is gon na be the end of me .
hey , sport . you winning ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> is everything going to be okay , <person> ?
<person> ' s school . my grades are okay .
you haven ' t been in any trouble ? good . how ' re you and <person> ?
is it true <person> ?
i got ta go .
do you always hold hands with reporters ?
this is my mother and father . they were very special to me . <person> sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave . i think people should know that .
if i don ' t ' grow up . '
you ' re like a kid , you ' re coming in here like it ' s saturday night , you want me to say that you ' ve got a fever -- you don ' t have to go to school .
<person> . i can ' t give out that number .
but you could call him and ask him to call me .
<person> .
<person> . i can ' t take the rejection . i ' m going to class .
why wasn ' t the ship protected ? ! ? !
i resent your tone , sir . i have men who are missing -
ho there .
oh god .
you ' re right . i should work , too . our first issue together is almost ready to print .
thanks , <person> . thanks for everything .
you straighten up and be polite , you hear me ?
who made this ?
jesus . it took you long enough . what if somebody was trying to strangle me ? or fuck me in the ass , even ? i mean , you guys are <person> .
meet my partner , <person> .
uh-huh . you mind if we take a moment to verify his identity ?
certainly . <continued_utterance> you can understand how a man could go off like that . i mean , a big , faceless organization like yours , coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property . <continued_utterance> . is how he described it .
hey , <person> . get me some water . or you ' ll diiiiie . !
i will -- i ' ll getcha water -- getcha lotsa water -- anything you say -- !
very good .
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr . <person> ?
is it ?
<person> .
thank you for what you ' ve done .
<person> ' t thank me . i only did it for <person> .
<person> <person> ' s captured the media ' s attention , but the question still remains : who is this guy ? and more importantly , can he compete in this talent pool ? can he win ?
i wish i knew , <person> . i wish i knew who he was , and i ' ve got ta say the fact that i don ' t know is strange . in an internet age where there are no secrets , this guy is a complete mystery . i can ' t find out anything about him . <person> <person> is officially <person> proof .
no way . you ' re going for the green . these fans paid good money to see golf shots they can ' t hit , not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit . <continued_utterance> thirteen years on tour and you ' re still a pussy . hit the fucking one iron , <person> .
thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this game ' s about your testosterone count .
the wind . it plays tricks in the attic .
there is no wind .
right . <person> .
you really think your icicles are a match for <person>ian steel ? <continued_utterance> fair enough . <continued_utterance> could we stop just a moment while i get another sword ?
<person> , i look at a hundred ideas a day . i choose one .
well , hope to hear from you , sir .
come on , <person> <continued_utterance> it ' s like that movie <continued_utterance> this one ' s almost thirty years old . it ' s about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love .
that ' s exactly why i don ' t watch ' em anymore -- it ' s bullshit ! why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid ?
what happened to him ?
oh , nothin . i never let on to mama about <person> bein the one . i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was ? i didn't tell <person> , neither . he was back home in chattanooga by then , anyhow , and i didn't see the point . somethin terrible happened to him , though . six months ago .
take it easy , boy .
ow ! ow ! it ' s broken !
<person> ' <person> ?
impossible .
never mind .
<person> . x <number> .
can ' t live with them , and you can ' t shoot ' em .
`` you can ' t shoot ' em ! '' i like that . i bet she led you on good , didn ' t she ? taking you up to the house to hang drapes . oh that ' s a good one . bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face . i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . then me busting in like some wild bear . ha ! bet you had a fire going under you .
oh , well , here -- let me help you .
oh , that ' s very kind of you -- very kind .
nice house for a shaman ' s daughter . you must be good .
come here . <continued_utterance> there ' s something in your past ; something you want to keep hidden . there ' s a pain . something . someone you can ' t forget . and there is something you want very badly . it seems very far away to you , but you are determined , and you will do what you must to get it .
you ' re saying you willed these events to happen ?
i don ' t know , i ' m very confused right now .
you just go when i say go .
should have at least gotten the map off of him . <person> up with him then we did all this for nothing .
it ' s come on again .
where ?
<person> is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth , it ' ll kill everything in the vicinity .
<person> , <person> , this is something we came up with ?
incinerate it . like the others .
this man ' s family will want to see the body laid to rest .
we can take her out to <person> . find some quiet place . and put her in the ground .
you don ' t just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman .
well , what are we gon na do ?
hey , look , she ' s waking up .
alright gentlemen - settle down - settle down - horses on my right - men with money in their pockets on my left - it ' s the perfect combination . is <person> here ? fred shouts his reply from the crowd .
yes ! i ' s here .
oh , you mean somebody who ain ' t scared of a twelve gauge shotgun . and then what did they do ? camp out down below and just wait for him to die ?
well , whatever the hell happened it ' s just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place .
<person> .
<person> .
<person> ? i ' m civil .
you ' re not civil , you ' re glum . we got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me . <person> freezes as a bell goes off in his head . earl oh my god . she got to you . you <continued_utterance> she just practically asked you for a date . what the hell is wrong ? !
it ' s an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it ' s based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they ' ve done something wrong . or the level of what they ' ve done wrong .
the guy might not have been carrying anything .
you think shes pretty ?
i tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones . <person> aint bad , though . <person> gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle . <continued_utterance> whats wrong , sweetheart ? somethin botherin you ?
oh my god .
it was really stupid .
yes , there ' s nothing --
are you sure ?
you need my help . ? you need a goddamn keeper . are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand ? huh . ? are you nuts ? eh ? are you nuts . what are you going to do , bring her back to life ?
i ' m going to help her .
for instance , if a child is having trouble getting to sleep , what would you do ?
depends , if it was a continuing problem , i might recommend a mild sedative .
what ' s your play ?
<person> ' t worry about it . i just need to make a call . can you get practice started ?
put on your seat belt .
it pushes on my neck .
i refuse to be a burden to anyone .
you ' re not a burden , you ' re my husband .
<person> your senses have weakened after your many years of service .
or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see .
sure , i ' d do a lot more than that for it .
<person> , your father ' s in the next office . you should ' ve seen him get upset at <person> ' s party about your photo here .
yes --
please , professor , why can ' t we go along with you ? <continued_utterance> . polite ! we haven ' t been asked yet .
ok , then as , mr . <person> has been deemed incapacitated by this court , i ' m appointing the office of public guardian to serve as the guardian for his person and property . do you have the order for me to sign , mr .
yes , i do , <person> .
you can ' t come back . that is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .
you ' re a peach .
what ?
you know , <person> . `` oh , <person> '' . `` <person> '' , <person> ' -foster !
they ' re really cute . so what can i do for you ?
you didn ' t happen to talk to <person> today , did you ?
and the crates look like american m- <number> assault rifles , chilean antipersonnel mines , six french exocet missiles , and <number> - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of <person> made c- <number> <person> explosive . something for everyone . fun for the whole family .
what about id ' s ?
out of hand ?
confusing . but not really . because it ' s nothing .
piss is piss , no matter what robes surround it .
<person> said . i ' m impressed .
i don ' t know . when you say it , it sounds crazy . but what else could it all be ? jody shakes her head . <continued_utterance> i mean , he ' s so kind of grim and daunting , and she sounded terrified of something . <continued_utterance> <person> to me . i sound like some middle- aged <person> .
know what i think ?
no , i don ' t believe you .
well , <person> did call me into his office today . and he did tell me i didn ' t have my old job anymore .
yes .
did you kill him ?
she wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father .
so how can i help ?
really ? did she say why ?
no . but she ' s here with an attorney .
yes .
<person> , <person> . if the zodiac killer calls , be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right .
for you it is .
you can ' t go . you ' re my guest of honor .
how the hell did you .
federal bureau of investigation , <person> .
<person> , all systems are go . requesting permission to launch -- hey ! <person> ' d you get out here ? <continued_utterance> oh , well , you and i can have a cookout later . ha-ha-ha . <continued_utterance> <person> , do we have permission to launch ? -- uh , <person> , permission granted . you are confirmed at t minus <number> seconds . <continued_utterance> . and counting . <person> ! <person> ! eight ! seven ! six ! five ! four ! three ! two ! . one ! .
<person> for the sky ! !
you won ' t .
who ?
<person> weird .
any thoughts on why anybody ' d be growing corn in the middle of the desert ?
any way we can do it better ?
sure . more money in intelligence on their side of the border . so we have a better idea who we ' re looking for . more dogs . more people . supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through . outside of martial law that ' s about the best you ' re gon na do . but , i should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . in the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we ' re pulling over the same number of cars . what does that tell you ?
i did it because because i ' d never stopped thinking about you and if i didn ' t find you i knew my life would never be good again .
<person> leave .
you in a dance hall or somethin ?
just a place .
say you love me .
i love you . now give me the line .
i know where he ' s coming from . the only thing i really don ' t get is why he dumped you . up until i found that out , i thought his judgment was pretty sound .
<person> ' t even start . i ' ll be honest , i don ' t trust you . bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that i want to leave . what can you do about it ?
. <person> , school ended a few days later and that july her father got transferred to florida . the <continued_utterance> <person> , it ' s not something you exactly forget about , but i guess i must ' ve blocked it out of my head . then about a week ago i ' m driving on the highway and i got to thinking about <person> and suddenly i couldn ' t breathe . i couldn ' t keep up with the flow of traffic anymore i felt like i was going to die . i pulled into a rest area , parked the car , and just started shaking .
you know . rest areas are homosexual hang-outs .
dr . <person> ! it ' s me , <person> !
get in the car .
huh ?
the prom -- you going ?
no . all me .
<person> . i liked what the old woman said about us earlier .
it ' s great to see you , man . so everything ' s going good ?
yeah . well , i ' ve got a little problem . the guys at the bank want to take my house away . that ' s kind of why i came to see you , actually .
two minutes , ma ' am , and we ' ll be out of here . we just need the picture for <person> , and we ' ll be out of here .
<person> ? i don ' t understand .
what do you mean no ? they can fly us home .
they ' ll ask questions ; want to know why we were out here .
<person> , in ten seconds i eat the staircase .
<person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> here .
then lem me throw in a couple more things . <continued_utterance> <person> got ta eat , too . <continued_utterance> id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one , if its same to you .
we dont have no paper bags .
you ' re lucky you didn ' t break down in the desert . day like today , you ' d be dead in no time . when you leaving ?
not until my car ' s fixed . i don ' t know how long that ' s going to take .
where are we going ?
we ' re getting out of this place . we ' ve done enough .
these were taken inside letac an hour ago . pretty pictures , aren ' t they ?
i ' ve seen worse .
did i say that ? i ' ll drive him .
the car ' s still in town , daddy .
if i could do you think i ' d be standing here wasting my time . can you fix it , or do i have to go somewhere else ?
somewhere else ? mister , somewhere else is fifty miles from here . only other gas station down in town closed <number> years ago when the mine got shut .
<person> . is there anything you want to tell me ?
no . not that i can think of .
he was reenacting <person> ' s labianca murders .
<person> didn ' t kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
you ' re crossing the line , mr .
a statue in front of city hall , dedicated to principal dick <person>in ?
they still have to take it to a jury .
what i ' m saying , they ' re getting some help .
<person> harold , they ' re vulnerable , alright , but we don ' t want ' em to think they ' re under accumulation . go slow . <person> and the bahamas for me , will ya ? we feint towards it but we wait .
what about tipping off <person> ?
are you gon na call him , <person> ?
what ' ve i got to lose ? you okay , <person> ?
<person> , kids now are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age . you probably think she ' s still a virgin --
<person> ' t be ridiculous . she ' s only -- how old is she ?
i ' ve really thought about it a lot , and if you had asked me last year i ' m sure i would have said yes .
oh . thank you .
this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
i need to find my daughter . i ' ll pay you .
what ?
you said to leave it , remember ? we walked home .
well . at least now you know .
i think it was better when i didn ' t . it was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world . as <person> dwells on this , <person> bursts out laughing . <continued_utterance> what ' s so funny ?
you ' re way ahead of me again ?
it was the year of the rhizopus rot . <person> almost lost the farm . you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival . and in the end you saved the peaches and you didn ' t have to slaughter your sow .
by ritual , by sorcery , i well draw the lightning and send this child into the destructive realm .
and with my magic i ' ll send her into the . into the . he gropes for a word . bavmorda laughs at him .
so why the hell was i hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?
it was the feds . a truck load of guns gets snagged , <person> comes down on n . y . p . d . for some answers - they come up with us . they ' re grabbing at straws . it ' s politics - nothing you can do .
i understand . you ' re upset . you want to know what ' s going on . that ' s good .
why are you talking like that ?
<person> ? of me ?
not you . your talent .
brian , get off my ass !
excuse me ?
i said , ' i don ' t think so . '
you don ' t think what ?
thank you .
do i call you dr . <person> or <person> ?
what ' s up , <person> ?
<person> ' s out sick and can ' t find anything without her . it sucks .
i have a cold .
how ' s your cold ?
what ' s the matter ?
i got ta go . i ' m sorry --
hey ! give me that baby !
these pecks make terrible nurse- maids .
' methodology and <person>s of <person> . ' yes .
how old are you ?
forget it , <person> .
<person> ' t there anything i can say that ' ll change your mind ? you ' re gon na stay with your new friends ?
that ' s right , even if it sucks . this team is just depressing sometimes . <continued_utterance> that ' s where i sit , <person> .
<person> buddy . i got to be near , <person> . it ' s good luck .
i believe in this moment , that ' s all . there is nothing else . come on . he must weigh <number> pounds .
you hit me , <person> ? you hit a woman , you motherfucker ! <person> ' t your momma ever teach you anything . ? <continued_utterance> well ?
shhhhh . its four oclock . that womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin ? . <person> bein ripped apart by a gorilla , maybe . <person> sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one .
<person> , sometimes i got ta admit , you come up with some weird thoughts .
he was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen -- cost me three strokes a side . i carried my bag the last four holes . i love ol ' <person> but i need you .
you don ' t love me ?
what ' s a toby ?
you don ' t want to be at crossroads without one . it ' s a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .
later . i think i ' m gon na use it in my next game . if there ever is a next game .
<person> , you ' re bleeding . i forgot you got hit .
well , why should i ?
they had a rough life . your father was a bouncer . your mother was , well , a two-bit stripper . there was no place for a baby .
on a bench , across the street . <continued_utterance> you calling me a liar ?
someone ' s gon na take it .
do my eyes deceive me ?
i find it hard to believe myself .
nah , she asked the wrong question .
what was that ?
there ' s not many piano bars left where i ' m still welcome .
go ahead .
i don ' t know . why do you think ?
i ' m not sure yet , but i ' m starting to believe that everything happens for a reason . <person> , why did i eat the forbidden fruit ?
if you want help with your lines , i have two conditions . you have to promise not to fall in love with me .
no problem --
is <person> alive or dead ?
i don ' t know .
i ' m sorry about how we --
no . you ' re with who you should be . it ' s like she chose you .
i know you ' re not surprised i ' m back here , cause you can read my mind and all . she ' s not surprised . grace that ' s some cut . i told you to be more careful . <continued_utterance> yeah , well i said i was an idiot . whatta you say we get out of here , take a drive somewhere , talk .
how do you know he ' s still not here ?
i believe you . did that nice doctor let you out ? or-is this you improvising again , <person> ?
i ' m through improvising .
can i come home ?
the truce with <person> is conditional upon your exile .
shit . <continued_utterance> did you see that ?
what happened to you ?
what are you doing out here ?
he killed her . i ' m not crazy . he killed her and --
insurance . lloyds of london .
the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr . <person> . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london doesn ' t carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .
it ' s a classic depiction of good versus evil . notice the square jaw of slayer - common in most comic book heroes . and the slightly disproportionate size of <person> ' s body to his head . this again is common , but only in villains . the thing to notice about this piece . the thing that makes it very , very special . is its realistic depiction of its figures . when the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated . as always happens . this is vintage .
wrap it up .
what are you doing back so soon ? what about hiking to the gas station ?
it was closed . i was going to leave a note , but i didn ' t . you know . <person> anything to write with .
hundred-fifty .
to replace a goddamn radiator hose ! ?
<person> --
i see him .
rinse three times .
to put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works .
. and if i did , what ' s in it for moi ?
more money than you ever dreamed , <person> . and the thing is no one gets hurt . how bout a beer ?
i will .
<person> .
because i hate wearing glasses .
but they look good on you .
i know they haven ' t assigned anyone to it specifically . it ' s an old case .
an old case . can you find him ?
i don ' t have a bioport , remember ?
`` thou , the player of the game , art god . `` very spiritual . <person> , too . god , the artist . the mechanic . <person> .
<person> , i know i ' m not perfect , and i may have made a few wrong turns , but you have to understand -- i ' m a chosen . that ' s a lot of responsibility -- you can ' t even imagine .
the only one who thinks you ' re chosen is you , so shut up already !
i am going to take a wild guess that this isn ' t him , either . who is he , i wonder . not , i gather , the world ' s greatest living expert on <person> and <person> , but someone else entirely . will you be you be mean to him too ? will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly , miraculously , like a bolt from the blue , find that sharp little tongue of yours ?
no , i won ' t . because the man who ' s coming here tonight is completely unlike you . the man who is coming here is kind and funny -- he has the most wonderful sense of humor --
yes , sir !
no excuses , no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit for presentation ! i want a full practice charge tomorrow .
i ' m not .
nice work if you can get it , and you can get it if you try . any scotch left ?
who said that ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t be silly , <person> . <person>s . <continued_utterance> . don ' t talk .
it ' s pleasant down that way , too .
the doctor who saved him couldn ' t get it out , so <person> killed him . when <person> found the x-rays , there was mild jubilation . effectively , he ' s a dead man . she presses a button , the hologram turns . <continued_utterance> the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata , killing off his sense of touch . he feels no pain . he can push himself harder , longer than any normal man .
' that which does not kill me makes me stronger . '
fifteen so far . we ' re still pulling some bodies out of the water . <continued_utterance> looking for anyone in particular ?
f don ' t want any of the bodies taken away until i ' ve had a chance to go over this , understood ?
you ' re so twitterpated you don ' t even see the miner ' s hat and the pickax .
you ' re implying she ' s , what , a gold digger ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' s right . <person> is so unattractive .
what are you talking about ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t even . you ' re not going to show me that tired map .
<person> . <person> .
<person> , boys , that ' s enough . we just want to --
no ! this smug asshole insulted you and i want him to take it back .
i don ' t know . i was just wondering about my work and all . i mean , what is it i do exactly ? all i really do is run a bookstore --
all you really do is this incredibly noble thing -- <person> nods .
your hole is healed , then ?
pretty much .
is the house locked up ?
yes .
wow !
pulsating laserlight !
i ' m sorry . i ' m probably wrong . i assumed that night after the raid was the first time you two fucked , but obviously it ' s been going on longer than that .
<person> , you ' re being silly .
nope . never been .
<person> ?
blonde .
tell me some other things about her .
-- are dilating . that ' s a good sign .
we still have to get him to a hospital .
i don ' t know . this is bad .
it ' s bullshit . this guy could be l . a . p . d . i think it ' s a setup .
maybe . met a guy named <person> , owns a garage , could have some work in about a week . met a few hard luck boys whos stayin here . whats that smell ?
i barfed . <person> to make it to the bathroom . <person> out it was the wrong door anyways . i sorta got it cleaned up .
how can i reach you ?
you can ' t .
yeah , i did . <continued_utterance> my name ' s <person> . dr . alvin <person> .
i know the name . why ?
what did you find out ?
call off the manhunt looking for me . i didn ' t kill the transport guards .
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal . you ' ve tried to poison my people ' s hearts against me with your manipulation , with letters i never wrote . you ' ve been watching me eat , work , raise my family . wash myself in the river . and now you ' re here , arresting me at a sacred place . in your eyes , that ' s power . <continued_utterance> so i plant this tree for you . and i take all this stuff that you ' ve laid on me and my people , and i put it in this hole with this pine cone . and i bury it . cuz ya know what it is , <person> ? bullshit . and shit is fertilizer . and the mother will turn your lies into something that lives . <continued_utterance> that ' s what power is , in the indian way . <person> me to rapid , <person> . i ' m the enemy .
if i told you . that i think <person> ' s innocent . but i ' m in over my head . would you believe me ?
i don ' t know .
you drank a little too much . call me tomorrow if you want .
what do you mean ?
it ' s not true . right , <person> ?
my dad gets me all the books i want .
well , that ' s very nice of him .
i rest my case . <continued_utterance> if i don ' t make it back here by ten .
<person> ?
<person> . is <person> there ?
yes .
how ' d you know that ?
it ' s right there on your golf bag .

i ' m going to the mall for wrapping paper .
you don ' t need to talk to him .
i mean , he ' s probably , you know , upset about the i . r . s . taking the house and all our stuff .
<person> , <person> . can you tell me what he looked like ?
he was . like him . <continued_utterance> not <person> , like him <person> frowns , puzzled:
yeah , but he ain ' t got the salt to truly take a man ' s life . especially not <person> ' s . he was scared of him .
why ?
i ' ve come alone and unarmed .
to what end ?
well ! we needed the money ! it ' s not like i killed anybody , for <person> ' s sake . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry . well , we need the money . now we have it .
oh shit , thelma ! ! <person> ! <person> ! <person> !
no . bring him on deck with the others .
<person> is a fool ' s game captain .
i got to agree with that .
that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . <person> has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this . well that ' s just more than the man deserves .
you can ' t kill <person> . he ' s got too much light on him .
you need not kill a man to destroy him .
thank you .
before we start taking calls , the huge surge in ratings over the last few days , how do you hope to sustain that audience now that <person> appears to have reconciled himself , returned to `` normal '' ?
just ignore him .
oh , <person> . i hate this guy .
but you think about him -- it -- her .
<person> ' t you ?
she didn ' t do anything . she took the patient ' s history and signed the charts . ' k . c . ' ' <person> . '
the ' history ' . ?
it wasn ' t <person> . it was <person> .
oh . it was <person> gianni . so , <person> was abducted by <person> , and now <person> is posing as <person> .
i ' d be too scared to ask him for it .
oh , well , then -- we ' ll ask him for you .

oak knoll . <continued_utterance> you ' re right , that ' s not who i am .

<person> , don ' t hurt me .
<person> , i ' m freaked out . it worked . so just tell me right now - where is <person> ?
<person> ' t even tell me you ' re hot for <person> over there .

my god , lady . if you ' re looking for uranium , why didn ' t you go to moab ?
and you know what , it ' s not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it . but let ' s face it , nobody comes out of our rib .
was the dope in the diaper , yes or no ?
you must have been really sick .
how is the garden doing ?

prelims : drug pusher gone missing , presumed dead , we ' re investigat-
i could take after dad , too .

that ' s not true , parker .
are you feeling well ?
i ' ve never been so tired in my life . where is <person> ?
no . there ' s no one here .
i have to see her . as soon as possible .
<person> , and there ' s no business as expensive . i ' m twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it ' s all because that rabbit can ' t keep his mind on his work .
one too many safes dropped on his head ?
what price do you put , mr . <person> , on the future of the solar system ?
aw , come off it , man . just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball .
what happened ?
<person> was taken to the tomsky institute for a few days for observation . he lost his medical license , of course . a doctor can ' t try to kill one of his patients and expect to get away with it .
you ' re cursed , man , and if you stay here then we ' ll all be cursed . you have to leave .
where am i supposed to go ?
most places are , <person> .
they say money can ' t buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile .
i had to . <person> ' t i ?
couldn ' t you ' ve just pulled him off me ?
i did .
who the fuck is he ?
what ?
mine . land mine ! <continued_utterance> i stepped on a land mine !
march into jotunheim as you once did , teach them a lesson , break their spirits so they ' ll never dare try to cross our borders again !
you ' re thinking only as a warrior !
i guess it ' s better than having tribal patterns carved in my face .
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach .
you ' ve never been sick ?
i don ' t know for sure . . i don ' t think so .
yeah . i ' ve been getting out here a bit more often .
you got ta be kidding me .

<person> . this is mr . dorchester in records . we ' re looking for <person> .
<person> ' t worry -- i ' ve already told them we ' d have to cancel .
why ? we have a floor , haven ' t we ?
oh , i don ' t know . it was an accident .
that ' s some accident , hombre . you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard . <continued_utterance> we seen this kind of parachutes before , you know . u . s . <person> . you got some friends here , jump out with you guys ?
what are you gon na gain from this thing here ?
now let me see here . i ' ve got to isolate that for a moment and think it over .
here ' s a man you should meet , mr . <person> . excellent character study for you , the real-life actual melancholy dane .
indeed , sir ? how so ?
you sent that ?
uh-huh . i was worried about you .
oh . <person> at this . what do you want , snakeskin ?
just passin through on my way to who knows where .
which you pulled , hard !
that was code for `` i like you . `` <person> giggles .
so was the one in kansas city , and the one in <person> , ohio , and the one in waco , texas .
<person> , ohio wasn ' t so much .
<person> , for <person> ' s sake .
i can ' t .
i think she ' s been truckin ' with <person> . got pipes like <person> but she ' s a junk fiend : caught her mainlining in the ladies room a month back .
<person> ? <person> get her hooked ?
it ' s a common medical expression , it ' s a crash program to restore the heartbeat . dr . <person> cut an airway in her trachea , to get her oxygen , her and the baby . ms . <person> .
why wasn ' t she getting oxygen . ?
if i did , i ' d have kept my mouth shut . it fits , <person> . fifty-five gallons of <person> <number> <person> confiscated four years ago . guess who was in on the collar ? mac . he salts it away somewhere . he knows the stuff is potent , but the street chemists haven ' t figured out how to process it . but they do now . and now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum .
who else knows ?
come on , <person> , you can do better then that .
<person> is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent . the glass canister is shot into the air and detonated . the black and white chemicals mix , forming a toxic cloud . when it settles down to earth , it ' ll kill everything in the vicinity .
you got a beer ?
what kind ?
you ' re an easy man to track , <person> . ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on .
is that right ? what are the trees saying today ?
where are you from any way ?
depths of hell . <person> . how ' bout you ?
he was large ? <continued_utterance> did you try to fight him ?
i . he had my wrists pinned behind me .
i forgot one more thing you will need to write down . <person> circulation is a chronic problem for people in my condition .
so . you think it could be a cure ?
i thought it was <person> tailing me .
<person> ' s greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side .
- how did you get all this stuff , this apartment , this life - <continued_utterance> i see .
how about if you help me ? unless i ' m horning in here .
so what are you going to do ?
do ?
all right , old man . <person> .
get me a dr . <person> ! i don ' t want no <person> . <person> ain ' t nothing but flavored water . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t forget to open it for me . i can ' t be opening my own bottle .
where are her parents ?
they ' re dead . they died .
that ' s good . it means the circulation ' s coming back .
<person> , but i mean really burn .
i think you have a gift for it . it was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness .
meanness ? let me tell you --
oh no , <person> ran it five feet past . how did he get the name ' <person> ' ?
he played catcher on the high school baseball team . the star pitcher had this big-league curve , and not all his pitches hit <person> in the mitt . finally , you got ta respect a man ' s doggedness . you know ? the team decided <person> sounded better than <person> .
i wonder if <person> got out . <continued_utterance> . i don ' t know how we ' re going to get home . i ' ve never been in new york , have you ?
i want to see the empire state building .
that ' s not . it ' s not like that .
i ' ve never even met you .
no , no ! <person> ' em around , turn ' em around !
eh , he ' s puttin ' ' em in backwards !
i figured they could wait a few years . it ' s not like they need my money to build a bomber . you think they ' re waiting for my money before they dig a new road ? are they all sitting there saying , ' well , it ' s time we went to see that guy on <person> . can ' t run this government without his four thousand dollars . ' i figured they ' d give me a little leeway . i ' m going to pay them . i know i ' ve got a debt . i just need a little leeway .
you can ' t mess around with the government . why don ' t you go to <person> , they ' ll take care of your taxes for you .

well , you ' d best get something . even if they didn ' t do it , it times out that they most likely witnessed it . i want somebody to at least talk to ' em . put out an apb with a description and see what we get back .
<person> .
what happened ?
the i . r . s . they need my furniture . they got some living room somewhere in this country that needs to be furnished .

who called this meeting ?

<person> . i ' m sick -- with leukemia . <continued_utterance> i found out last winter . i ' m not responding to treatment anymore .
why didn ' t you tell me ?
i don ' t know . you have to understand that , to understand what we ' ve really created with existenz .
you ' re telling me , for example , that you don ' t know what the special is ?
if you asked your girlfriend as a favor , would she do it with me ?
guys don ' t share their girlfriends .

<person> says it was she who ordered you out of the building . that you wanted to go back .
<person> , i was thinking we ought to -
at ease !

. work okay ?
no . i also wanted to say that i ' ll do whatever you think is best for <person> . i promise .
then leave him here . where he is .
that doesn ' t make him a child rapist . there ' s something else . this girl ' s had some problems . wrecked a couple of her mom ' s cars . <person> away .
where ' s this coming from ?
you want something ?
<person> i want something . i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop .
are you over at dr . <person> ' ?
<person> , i ' ve been here for about an hour already .
superior-er than you .

like an animal ! like an animal !
but yesterday , what did i have ?
i ' m sure you ' re mistaken . you musta told me before .
no , i would have told you `` <person> . `` only my grandmother , who ' s dead , ever called me <person> .
what kind of life is it to be hidden away ? i know you believe that what you are suggesting for franklin is best . but i think you are making it harder for him .
i think i know what ' s best for franklin . i am his mother !
what happened to her ?
there was only one job . <person> took the job . her friend took a hike . never saw her again .
well , if ever you need any more rats , we can always send ours over . `cause we ' ve more than we need , strictly speaking . besides , they scare off all the pretty girls .
our girls aren ' t afraid of rats .
by dawn , upon thirteen tolls of the runic drum !
<person> is too powerful . we need more forces . i say we retreat !
love .
yes .
i am <person> .
in one minute i ' m going to call the police --
your nickname is <person> ?
it ' s a long story , and we don ' t know each other .
<person> ! where are you !
in the helicopter .
something your father would ' ve come up with .
my father --
<person> , sure . i ' m not loaded , but it ' s okay -- i ' m working , i ' ve got modeling jobs lined up .
<person>o you have a boyfriend ?
what was that ?
`` what are you thinking ? '' . that was it . the hours are hell , but the money ' s starting to tumble in . i know this guy who ' s got an iron- clad way to make money , i can ' t lose and i can ' t get hurt .
well , i don ' t want to put you out .
<person> , put your boxes down and stay as long as you like . we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out .
nine-one-one emergency response .
<person> god ! hi ! <person> ! we need help !
<person> , bad report for <person> i ' m afraid . <person> here says there ' s no hope . we ' re going to have to put him down . <continued_utterance> . so i need you to round up <person> and greg , get a wagon and a harness stretcher . he has to be hauled .
a harness what ?
. tell me about this case .
this is a nuisance suit . he ' s looking for small change . he ' s asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don ' t want to go to court .
how did you settle on the amount ?
we thought it was just .
<person> ' t do it , honey .
i knew you ' d survived the accident .
no .
we ' ll find another couple , <person> .
may i advise you ? <continued_utterance> <person> was only nine years old when his father was assassinated . he lost his childhood forever that day . i have watched him grow toward manhood , seen the toll his life demands . a boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man . he is shy , yet boastful . giving , yet stubborn . but most of all , he is not yet sure exactly who he is . the boy who lost his father . or the king of france .
but how can i . ?
you ' ll kill yourself .
only if you get in my way to make me fall .
yeah ?
wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives ?
no .
i ' <number> get right to the point . i ' m smarter than you . i ' <number> find out what i want to know and i ' <number> get it from you whether you like it or not .
so now what happens ?
<person> if that judge deems you incapacitated then you will need a guardian . and if we can ' t find your daughter then the state .
i was the company secretary from <number> to <number> . i supposedly worked for all six companies . but . they weren ' t . i mean , it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone . we never sold anything the whole time i was there . sometimes people came and got paid . i don ' t really know what we did .
did mr . <person> say where the money came from ?
might head down to egypt . i hear it ' s a happening kinda place .
are you going alone ?
you ' d swear he ' d sprout wings and fly if <person> had told you so . it ' s a fine thing , loyal to your mate . even if he is a bit barmy . a team of two might manage , given a month and good weather .
ted too squeamish to watch , is he ?
we ' re looking for a suspect . we ' ve reason to believe he ' s still in the area .
you have no right to keep us here .
<person> ' <person> , you think your shit don ' t stink . well i got news for you -- you ' re goddamn right it don ' t ! how the hell are ya ? !
uh , i ' m fine . just wanted to let you know i ' ll have your car back in a couple hours , i ' m still staking out this girl ' s apartment .
shut the fuck up .
you best hope you find her ' fore i do . `cause i will enjoy tearing her ass apart . and when i ' m done there , i will cut her eyeballs out and skull fuck her . any luck , <person> ' s already beat me to it .
me and my friends sneak in on the weekends . we hang around , pick up on the babes , drink some wine , get wasted on killer hash --
you shouldn ' t be smoking either .
listen to me . the one thing in life that i definitely don ' t regret . is the choice . i made to be your mother . <continued_utterance> i miss you .
so much .
curb the squealing . you a gangsta or a boy scout ?

write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you ' re crazy about me .
you can trust me completely .
i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
that ' s not what i meant --
and when i said the thing about the price club and cans of olive oil , that wasn ' t what i meant either --
for me . <person> is all about the smells . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s my favorite . that and cider with cloves .

what do you mean ?
i mean i don ' t think you should live here anymore . i don ' t think you know how to behave around an eight-year- old and i don ' t know how to make you stop , so i think you shouldn ' t live here . i don ' t know what else to say .

so you decided to take a holiday on the orient express ?
<person> , <person> , maybe she ' s not your type , but you could , at least , be civil .
<person> ? i ' m civil .
five more turns and your neck will break . <continued_utterance> since i was a child , i ' ve always had a power over men . when i realized my father wouldn ' t rescue me from the kidnappers , i knew i had to form a new alliance .
you turned <person> .
oh , i see , there ' s milk with no milk in it ?
some babies are allergic to milk .
me . <continued_utterance> i ' m very sorry --
what kind of a man are you , son ?
to cover you or the war ?

<person> ' s greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side .
<person> ran <person> for you , not <person> .

you bet .
did you study under <person> ?
i want my daddy .

i ' m fine . i ' m going to live a long time . that ' s what i called to tell you .
<person>ny
actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot --
<person> up , <person> . i wasn ' t really seeking golf tips .
what does she do ?
some kinda legal secretary of something . <person> to some boring jerk . <continued_utterance> and she could be so hot , if she wanted to be . she ' s like a dying plant that just needs a little water .
where ' d you go ? <continued_utterance> i said where ? where ' d you go ? !
was dark . find a light .
but he acted like he ' d never heard of it .
did he say that ?
helena , i ' m so sorry --
<person> , thank god . <continued_utterance> can you please tell me what on earth is going on ?
<person> , can ' t you help me ? i ' m all alone .
tell you what . if this guy calls you again --
but who ' ll work the machine ?
i ' m the only one who does . why do you think <person> ' s left me alone all this time ? <continued_utterance> i was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the sphinx . it must ' ve been programmed . some kind of . force . shot into me .
i wondered about them , for so many years . i wondered if i looked like them , acted like them . i wondered why they gave me up .
giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did . when they founded `` heaven , '' they wished they could take you back but it was too late . all they could do was build the empire , knowing that someday it would all be yours .
i ' ll call you at four .
you couldn ' t possibly make it three thirty , could you ?
you red ?
well , i aint <person> .
why ? it ' s so obvious she ' s just wants him for the money .
i just can ' t win this one , <person> . trust me .
i ' m sorry to be late , <person> , but i was wrestling with an important matter of state .
why is it i don ' t see any of my musketeers ?
it didn ' t look like you were all that upset with the attention .
<person> thing you ' re not a cop .
<person> .
i want you to know . i don ' t know . i just think you ' re a hell of a guy .
who ?
my brother . he fell out of the old beech tree . <person> his neck . i was on a camp out . they started going at it , throwin ' things , a real knock down . they didn ' t find him ' till the next morning . they didn ' t even know why he was up there .
ah .
out of state . <person> .
should i ?
i wrote you a letter right after i saw the article in the paper .
yeah . it ' s in my bag . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> , can i ask you something ?
yeah . of course . what ?
because we don ' t ! it ' s a rule ! that ' s the tree of the knowledge of good and <person> . you don ' t eat from that one . nobody ever has .
why not ?
i thought all that <person> stuff was so charming . f-o-x .
i never lied about it --
<person> ? what are you doing here ? everyone and their mother ' s mother is looking for you .
they have me soon enough . where are you going ?
shut up , <person> ! or i ' ll throw you off the bus myself !
did they really pin all of you ?
i ' m telling you , the more you pick her up , the longer it ' ll take her to get to sleep .
thanks for the advice -- now why don ' t you just shove it ? i know you let her scream for hours but i can ' t .
my condolences to the window .
not now . we may need a hostage .
their fate is sealed . but for my faith and devotion , the self-same <person> has given unto me the whole of this land , from the jordan to the negev , from the river of egypt to the great euphrates . this did he grant to me and my seed .
this is all your land ?
<person> ! i guess that did it ! help yourself .
oh -- <continued_utterance> why , it ' s a man ! a man made out of tin !
i don ' t know . he ' s kind of a mook .
what ' s a mook ?
just a minute . i ' ll pour you some coffee .
you ' re not carrying a bullwhip . how ' d you manage to put my kids to work ?
what kind of trip ? i thought you were working with him .
i was .
boy , it ' s a miracle you ' re still alive fighting like that .
what do you mean ?
yeah . i actually brought you a copy .
who did he leave it too ? did he leave it to <person> ? !
what ?
was a massacre . soldiers there murdered old folks , women and babies , and dumped em in a trench . <person> peru probly killed the most .
<person> . <person> what are you talking about ?
i think you got the wrong idea .
maybe it ' s because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires , so then can she . <continued_utterance> she can become a child again . who wouldn ' t want that ?
she ' s on the move . time to go .
this . <continued_utterance> we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs . <person> . what ' s her first name ?
i don ' t know .
but i ' d face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains . <person> - - i won ' t be any trouble , because i don ' t eat a thing -- and i won ' t try to manage things , because i can ' t think . <person> ' t you take me with you ?
why , of course i will !
<person> didn ' t kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
<person> did this wanted to do <person> one better to improve upon what was already done .
you ought to watch it with that shit , <person> . you get busted again , you go back in a two-tine loser .
you got something against cigarettes ?
hey , no kidding ? where are your offices ?

you sure ?
yeah . i ' m good . why ?
oh , come on ! murder one and armed robbery , thelma !
murder one ! god , <person> , can ' t we even say it was self-defense ?
my father used to hunt in a forest like this . he promised to take me on my tenth birthday . i don ' t know why he picked that year . something about a boy becoming a man . i ' d lay in bed at night and imagine it , just the two of us . but he died before i could go with him .
well . you have your boyhood wish at last . the dark forest . the thrill of the hunt . the nearness of death .
<person> and son , together at last . that happened with <person> ?
i ' ve stayed here after , let ' s see , your mother , <person> that ballet dancer --

thank you .
just on paper . <continued_utterance> <person> is to be removed from the city council race . the means and methods implemented to that end i will entrust to you .
you want me to torpedo <person> so your buddy bethune can win a city council seat uncontested-
but he never stays on that long ! sometimes he hangs up after just a couple of seconds .
it ' s the only way we can help you . by the way , what ' s your name ?

i ' d like to fuck you .
i came clean . i told it like it happened on the boat . so what if i left out how i got there ? it ' s got so many holes in it , the d . a . would ' ve told me to blow amnesty out my ass . so you got what you wanted out of me . big fucking deal .
and this is why you never told the d . a .

you don ' t want to stay , do you ?
it isn ' t that , but i don ' t fit here anymore than you would in my time .

a weak vaccine against the virus <person> has been infected with . it must be administered with ninety six hours .

-- it was business . what is that supposed to mean ? i am so sick of that . all it means is it ' s not personal to you , but it ' s personal to me , it ' s personal to a lot of people . what ' s wrong with personal anyway ?
nothing .
so what are we gon na do ? adopt him ?
no . but i ' m not sending him back until i talk to his mother . she better freaking call me back .

oh , <person> , not like that . not this time -- not tonight .
what ' s up ?
well . i ' ve got a little more news about your friend <person> . <person> seems relieved .
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association . the world is a hologram , <person> .
yes , it ' s a great big psychedelic circus ride , isn ' t it , <person> ?
<person> , drag him in here . if you be nice , i will take you to disneyland . <person> , <person> and <person> put the suitcases down .
now you don ' t have to say anything if you don ' t want to .
i ' m not breathing right .
you ' re not breathing right ?
now what ?
we ' re not giving up , thelma .
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
knock it off , <person> , just ' cause you ' re in love doesn ' t mean everyone else has to be .
i have to . i just want to know what it ' s like to be with someone else . <continued_utterance> because if what i ' ve got with <person> is as good as it gets , i just . . i got ta know .
well , how are you going to manage it ?
he ' s right , <person> . <person> is saying we may have some time . we ' ve got to use it .

i ' m sorry to hear that .
it ' s my own fault . never marry a man who lies .
we ' re talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons , <person> , that human frailty you like to blather about , not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit .

so <person> ' s goes through turkey , direct to the med . ?
a huge project . the most expensive of the pipelines , but the one supported by every western leader . none of the american oil companies were willing to take it on . but king has connections to the region . he married into the vavra family , rich local industrialists . he used those connections to hold it all together .
everybody knows why she went over <person> . you jibed the boat .
i was trying to get her up wind ! that ' s what you do when you ' re hit a-beam . or maybe you ' re too stupid to know that !

he asked me to take his `niece and nephew ' to their cousin in oxnard . these beautiful , funny little kids . i dropped them off . <person> ' t ask any questions -- i believed <person> . a week later i saw their pictures in the post office . a week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near san pedro . i ' ll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought i was part of it . that i knew what was going to happen to them . so i pray to god that he let them look in when i put that knife into <person> . but i ' ll never ask his forgiveness for doing it . why do they call you `enforcer ? '
' dayo ! . da , da , da , da , day . daylight come and he wan na go home . '

the fact that you attend this school makes you privileged . <continued_utterance> finally , i ' d like you to join the drama club . rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings .
i see . he does talk loud .
<person> would not have sent us to <person> without thinking it was a high priority situation .
i know .
. then it wouldn ' t be stalkerish .
i saw .
and what does that tell you ? <continued_utterance> and what does that tell you ?
i didn ' t do it , <person> .
who are you protecting , then ?
sure . more money in intelligence on their side of the border . so we have a better idea who we ' re looking for . more dogs . more people . supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through . outside of martial law that ' s about the best you ' re gon na do . but , i should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . in the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we ' re pulling over the same number of cars . what does that tell you ?
that triple the amount of stuff is going through .
you ' re right about the old man . his power ' s long dried up . he ' s supposed to be a medicine man but he won ' t go see the people . he says we changed , and we don ' t listen . well , he don ' t go out and talk no more . i haven ' t had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar , and this <person> is gettin ' watered .
cut the shit . you shouldn ' t be in here , <person> .
<person> ' . <person> ' came in today at all .
<person>g under peaches ? <person> again under peaches .
why didn ' t you go up there ? <continued_utterance> speak up .
he ' s afraid to climb .
i will .
do you love me ?
a plague ?
the plague to end all plagues , <person> . a silent weapon for a quiet war . the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure . they ' ve been working on this for fifty years . while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned <person> .
<person> , sure . hey , look , will you -- look at that sparkling beauty .
<person> . i mean , it ' s like .
he wants to meet you . he called last night and asked me to set it up . what do i tell him '
tell him we ' ll meet . mcmanus if you ' re lying , <person> .
if i had to explain it you <person> ' t understand . just say we ' re brothers to the bone .
<person> , but some of the things they say your brothers ' ve done .
i ' m sorry , <person> . i ' m sorry it had to happen like this . she was losing it .
a mask of blood .
something was there . you saw it .
did i ?
<person> , what kind of accent you got there ? you one of them russians ?
i am russian , da ! i am also
no way . no way .
<person> . now i ' m going to slap you .
yup .
<person> ?
we ' re american soldiers . we don ' t abandon people .
funny you should say that while we ' re out looking for gold .
so what did we just make ?
a similar triangle ?
my wife , <person> . my son , <person> . my daughter , <person> . my sister , <person> .
<person> . i was close ! what a wonderful family !
why not ?
cuz nothing happened at school .
i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .
i want to know where <person> is .
-- the pleasure of sofia . <person> .
we met today at the library , if you can believe that --
the swamp , most likely . <person> ' s a swamp rat , knows the body will never be found there . but he ' s made a mistake .
her grandmother said she ' d been threatening to run away . and i found the car at the miami bus terminal .
your sister <person> said she saw him in the field with you .
i think that was yesterday .
i could swear i heard my son call me .
you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there .
but you must buy your ticket and give your word that you ' ll go home . this is all about trust again , <person> . we must have trust .
i trust . i absolutely trust . i ' ll go buy my ticket . <person> now !
then why don ' t you ?
<person> ?
<person> ?
mr . crabtree was saying how <person> killed himself , only he couldn ' t remember how .
no , c ' mon !
oh . <person> . well . just a couple things . one -- there ' s only two kinds of beer available -- <person> and <person> . <person> ' s better . and two -- if you see <person> hanging around the hotel bar -- hot , hot , hot -- but don ' t touch . she belongs to tacho , and if anybody gets caught with her then el presidente has promised to personally cut off the guy ' s .
outside check out the rest of the house . <continued_utterance> we ' re police officers . we ' re looking for a fugitive , <person> . he ' s living here ?
i have nothing to say to you . get out of my house !
i have no idea .
the course of love is full of frightful turns . but , no matter how you feel , no matter how hopelessly afraid . never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in france . <person> that your starting point , and everything else will fall . into place .
what ' s on it ?
a little <person> , little <person> , little <person> , little this , little that . and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick i ever met .
books . <person> . how much we both love new york . harmless . harmless . meaningless . bouquets of sharpened pencils .
excuse me ?
i ' ve heard some foolish things in my life .
<person> is coming to pick me up .
why not ? how was the fishin ?
i think they are too serious , these american fishermen . in honduras , we are not so concerned with the method . reggie orders martinis for the three of them .
my secret diary . there are pages missing .
who would do that ?
the <person> boy saw him , <person> . i ' ll make it , but <person> and the homicide department off my back or they ' ll blow the whole thing .
when word gets out that <person> was a cop , all hell will break lose . you ' ve got <number> hours . that ' s all i can give you . <number> hours on your own . after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department . <continued_utterance> tell you what . why don ' t you and that blonde what ' s-her-name come over for dinner sunday . how ' bout that .
no ! never !
so , it was your first time .
because i ' m still scared !
oh , come on .
it has a trigger . i pulled it .
can i see it ?
enough to level an entire city block .
if i were you , i ' d get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the biltmore hotel .
remember me , from the bookstore ?
of course i remember you .
' bye , honey . i won ' t wait up .
see ya .
<person> , dad . this display of unconditional love is appalling .
we are a family .
yes , <person> .
tell me . what brought you to paris . and don ' t say ' a horse . '
you ' ve been well ?
yes . you ?
naturally you have copies .
i have an alternate version of the first chapter .
<person> , i ' ve been all over the place .
well , it ' s good to have you back here , i ' ll tell you that .
stands about so . <person> hair . <person> kind of banged up . was in an accident .
oh , yeah ? i was just with that guy , not more ' n an hour ago . <person> bad . <person> , huh ?
what if we have to fold ? i ' ll never find another part time job and i won ' t be able to pay the rent and i ' ll have to move to brooklyn .
the joy of rent control . six room for $ <number> a month .
who else ?
<person> for instants .
the truce with <person> is conditional upon your exile .
but couldn ' t we find a way to --
what are you implying , <person> ?
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .
<person> , <person> , i know you ' re-
you know nothing . what you don ' t <person> would fill a book . <person> , i feel like it ' s when you ' re around i need it most . you ' re never yourself , you never relax . never . everything ' s so stiff and dead . you always have to keep a rein on everything , ever yourself . oh , you smile sometimes , i ' ve even seen you laugh . but there ' s no light in your smile for me , <person> , nothing to keep me warm . and i get cold , <person> . i get so cold . what ' s between you and that <person> woman ?
no . i can give her an abortion . <person> rid of the bastard child , make them conceive one in wedlock . and then we are right as rain .
abortion ? no . that we won ' t do .
he ' s no magician .
he turned that monster into stone !
oh , now i ' ll never get home !
stay with us , then , <person> . we all love you . we don ' t want you to go .
hey , thanks dad . i never had one of these .
you better hurry . you ' re going to be late for school .
oh ! come back ! <person> ' t go without me !
i can ' t come back ! i don ' t know how it works !
i out rank you , that ' s why .
in the service you do , but we ' re not particularly in the service right now . way i see it , what we ' re doing , that doesn ' t particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
oh no , no .
<person> <number> seconds , a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure . has an lcd readout , and it ' s cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor .
a lot ? i mean , a whole lot ?
as much as possible .
i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight ?
this isn ' t some <number> ' s porno film , you dip shit . there are no wild sex orgies .
i don ' t know . she was standing outside my building with the police and the reporters .
what police and reporters ?
like take that trip to <person> . go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico . <person> ' s your chance .
but those are our dreams , son . we have to make them come true .
the first day you lied to me --
i didn ' t lie to you --
but this can ' t be possible . how can a game event emerge into real life ?
there ' s a very weird reality- bleed-through effect happening here . i ' m not sure i get it .
trying to scare up a bidding war between me and <person> , eh ? well , it won ' t work . i ' ll call <person> and i ' ll have ' em put out a rabbit call the likes of which this town ' s never seen !
it ' s your dime , <person> .
<person> ' t the state just leave him in his home ? that ' s what the guy wants .
they could but they never will . it ' s too much work . they ' ll probably move him into <person> . hand me one of their brochures ?
well , how are you going to manage it ?
<person> doesn ' t get home until at least two in the morning .
tech support .
yes , i ' m your tech support . we first met <number> years ago .
you ' d tell me anything to save your pathetic life .
you know what kind of woman <person> is , jake . you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior . what ' s she to you , jake ; a woman who wants you dead ? let me kill her . all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
who ' s <person> ?
nevermind . the point is we must elope .
who ' s car did you steal ?
a teacher ' s .
i ' m assuming command of this investigation myself .
what investigation ? <person> ' s murder ? <person> ' s disappearance ? what are you investigating ?
the only reason that <person> is even in this tournament is because of a video showing him beating up <person> in the gym .
but the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video , which is even more stunning than the <person> video . let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven ' t seen it , and i don ' t know anyone who hasn ' t , but <person> riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle , saving lives in the process , and then walked away without claiming a medal . he ripped the door off a tank !
he can ' t find you . as soon as we stop - before we stop - we ' ll jump off and i ' ll take you to a hotel in town .
and after that ? august has all our money . where will i go ?
can ' t blame me for trying . you look as beautiful as that painting i just bought . <continued_utterance> so what ' s the problem <person> ? you look like <person> thursday . <person> case of puppy love ?
it ' s not puppy love , <person> .
i like you .
<person> , do you want me to call the cops ?
they gave her the wrong anesthetic .
why is that ?
are you kidding ? this magazine is my dream . it ' s every red-blooded , heterosexual male ' s dream .
i never figured you for a pimp .
what war ?
great heavens , man , don ' t you know we ' ve been at war with germany since nineteen fourteen ? i thought perhaps you had seen action in france . or maybe . perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better . <person> ' t you come in ?
no , i haven ' t seen your baseball . <person> , warren , you know you ' re not supposed to leave the yard by yourself .
you know him ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
nothing . i ' m not going to be around for a while . i ' ll call you when i can .
oh really ? what ' s his problem ?
his problem is that he ' s like totally sheltered because you treat him like he ' s three , instead of eight , so that ' s how he behaves .
<person> , <person> , about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car , as soon as i get where i ' m going i swear i ' ll --
two-hundred .
do you have to call me that ?
i don ' t know your real name .
so all by yourself , you ' re going to destroy every government ; in the world .
easier than that , buddy . i ' ll get them to destroy each other . you kill an entire peace conference , someone is going to have to pay . then our friend <person> continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour . london , cairo , beijing . pretty soon everyone ' s involved . these guys bomb those guys , those guys invade these guys . soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days . no rules , no law , everybody free to do what they want .
no . <continued_utterance> in the aftermath of the battle , i went into the temple , and i found a baby . small for a giant ' s offspring -- abandoned , suffering , left to die . <person> ' s son .
<person> ' s son . <continued_utterance> why ? you were knee-deep in jotun blood . why would you take me ?
ask him what it is .
he says it ' s a box .
excuse me . <continued_utterance> <person> ? . <continued_utterance> . no , i just got in . i don ' t know if i can . <person> , i can ' t talk now . can i call you back ? . <person> . <person> . she hangs up the phone , stands and turns back toward the door . <person> is standing right behind her .
i ' m not from new york , actually . but i ' m very , very far from home .
tell me which ones are my moments and i ' ll try to duplicate them .
this is a moment . you look great .
doggone you ! <person> get them horses loose !
all right - you ' ll be sorry .
no , he said not to tell anyone .
but this is an emergency !
<person> , i think you and i have some things to talk about .
you do ? you finally think so too ? !
any sign of lindenmeyer ?
none . he could be hiding , he could be helping <person> , or could be in little pieces on <person> beach . any idea what <person> ' s going to do next ?
i know . <continued_utterance> i need to ask you something . and i need you to tell me the truth . <continued_utterance> who is it ? who is trying to kill me ?
i don ' t know . but i will find him .
ahh , the rampant <number> wit . i , of course , am laughing inside . but i dare say you ' ve met your match in this machine . the absolute latest in intercepts , surveillance and countermeasures . <person> plating and armor , a multi- tasking heads-up display . completely indestructible . all in all , rather stocked .
' <person> loaded ' i think is the term .
dr . <person> .
dr . <person> ' s not in .
you boys want a soda ?
oh , yeah , a coke . you buying ?
for grand theft auto . they found his prints in your father ' s car .
that ' s terrible . did he go quietly ?
and who pays for that ?
he does . it comes out of his estate and he can afford it . trust me .
we failed to mention the mower guy ' s a drunk , that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house , so he can ' t say how long she was in there . <person> with the kids . they saw her running down the street , but that ' s it . with no physical evidence , what do we have ? her word against his .
you ' re telling me you believe the guy ?
where is you would care to go at once , mr . price ?
bang-bang .
well , i ' d need the famous <person> charm , not that you ' d have to do anything you haven ' t done already .
how .
my parents sleep in separate beds .
thank you .
it ' s fine . it ' s done . basically . i ' m just sort of . . tinkering with it .
<person> . i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend . think that might be possible ?
i still aint sure what my daddy looks like .
like you , sweetheart . you and your daddy got the same mouth , eyes , ears , and nose . only difference is your color hair is like mine .
you ' re gon na fuck me over , aren ' t you ?
oh , for <person> ' s sake .
oh , i don ' t know , thelma . i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays . maybe we could have children with the prison guards .
i ' m not suggestin ' that ! i ' m not goin ' back . no matter what happens . so don ' t worry about me . <person> speeds up . <continued_utterance> can i ask you kind of a weird question ?
a vacation from my problems . you bet i will !
<person> ?
are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some . artificially injected fantasy ?
no , not quite . we didn ' t give you this . you ' re creating it yourself -- remember the option we offered you ? intelligence agent ? something inside you liked that idea , fastened on it . what you ' re experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating .
it ' s not my concern . i want to be left alone !
my god , you ' re afraid of these people .
it ' ll never feel right .
at least they work . would you rather have no hands at all ?
and after that ? august has all our money . where will i go ?
<person> , i ' m not leaving you . we ' ll find a way together . i won ' t let you go back to him . i promise . <continued_utterance> . i ' ll call my dean at cornell . if i can take my finals again , get my degree , i can get my license .
this picks up body heat . humans should be orange . there .
it ' s getting redder . <continued_utterance> bond . q switches the screen off , clears his throat .
hey there . i was beginnin ' to think you wasn ' t comin ' back . you don ' t look so good .
<person> , well , i ' ve been around the bend a bit .
let me get this straight .
if it isn ' t straight by now , son , you probably should see a doctor .
<person> ? - who are the <person> ? <continued_utterance> why are you afraid of the <person> ? <continued_utterance> tell me .
when they call , we must go below .
that ' s a hallmark of <person> ' s philosophy right there .
<person> is shocked . he thought he had a free pass into the second round , but instead he ' s going home . he dominated the fight the entire way , but fell prey to a very technical finish .
i think you skipped a couple steps . <continued_utterance> you forgot the `` now i ' m going to tell you what the hell is going on '' step . <person> usually that comes before the , `` it ' s over '' <person> . and it always , always comes before the `` you can go '' <person> . what is over ?
the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head . <continued_utterance> there are probably only four or five individuals in the world who can claim more knowledge of comics than myself . i ' ve spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read . i have studied the form intimately . i have seen the patterns in them . the references to social and cultural events and the atmosphere that surrounded them . i ' ve come to believe that comics are our last link to the ancient way of passing on history . <continued_utterance> the egyptians drew pictures on walls about battles , and events . countries all around the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms . i believe that comics , just at their core now . have a truth . they are depicting what someone , somewhere felt or experienced . then of course that core got chewed up in the commercial machine and gets jazzed up , made titillating - cartooned for the sale rack . <continued_utterance> this city has had its share of disasters . <person> publicized ones . it was around the time of that plane crash , when it first entered my head . and there it stayed , as i waited and watched the news over the years . and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed . and just like that , an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality .
damn if i won ' t .
you ain ' t tying me up .
just plain old coffee . none of that mocha nonsense .
it ' s fine .
what killed those men can ' t be identified in simple medical terms . my god , we can ' t even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv . we have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved .
a plague ?
i ' ll meet you there .
<person> ' t get out of the car .
this is a fun place . but we don ' t usually come here until after the orgies .
ah , in other words , this is the apres-orgy salon ?
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? your phones are almost certainly tapped . and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist , who may be a --
no . he checked out okay -- <person> slaps her again .
the bride doesn ' t want to chat ?
stop it .
yeah . <person> . you oughta know , you bet her for me .
of course .
<person> puffs . is that your brand ?
it ' s for <person> .
<person> ?
yeah ?
did you come here for money ?
mom , that ' s a terrible thing to ask .
what ' s he talking about ?
in college . a car accident .
i hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that i then have to wear like last year .
it was disgusting ?
but banishment ? you would lose him forever ? he ' s your son !
what would you have done ?
what ? !
what in the hell is that up there ?
<person> . i think we ' re going to oklahoma city . but i ' m not sure .
do you think you could . i mean , i could help pay for gas . thelma knows <person> isn ' t going to like this .
i am a legitimate business . fishing boats . <person> . check it out . tax records , everything --
listen you motherfucker , you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon .
how unlike him .
<person> your smart mouth . this means the end of child support .
oh . i bet by the end he gets something out of it .
like what ?
<person> , will you come here a minute ? i want to tell you something .
what is it ?
what ' s your name ?
<person> .
i have body issues .
no , you ' re perfect . your face , your hair -- your eyes are like the sea .
got it .
be happy ! <continued_utterance> staff meeting , everybody . <person> , <person> -- podium duty . <continued_utterance> hey etch ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> oh ! ! you got me again , etch ! you ' ve been working on that draw . <person> knobs in the west .
knock it off , <person> , just ' cause you ' re in love doesn ' t mean everyone else has to be .
<person> ? come on , i wouldn ' t call it love .
anyone hear from sammy this morning ?
i didn ' t .
no , my grandparents are dutch , so i was raised on salted licorice and sinterklaas .
how ' s that different from the regular <person> ?
oh i was walkin ' down lime street one day .
hey ! <person> ! blow the man down .
you ' ve been there ?
hell , i ' ve had days i would gladly trade with a whippin ' dog . <person> ' t much you can do when you feel like that ' cept tough it out .
he saw an owl .
so what ?
you can kill me . but a surprise waits for you in england . that even <person> can ' t prevent .
what . surprise ?
a strange threat . i can only assume you ' re here to kill me anyway . pity about mr . <person> . mcmanus fair trade for <person> . <continued_utterance> ahh , mr . <person> . do join us .
we know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . i ' m offering you the chance to call this off .
<person> , not dangerous . he was distraught when he found out that you ' d taken all of our research . it was years of his life , gone ! he got depressed , started drinking , and . well , you know the rest .
uh-huh . you mind if we take a moment to verify his identity ?
i ' ve got half the british government breathing down my neck . i don ' t have time for your nonsense . she ' s surprised - and hurt - by his coldness .
<person> ' t you even miss me ? <person> ' t i mean anything to you ?
i can do it !
the code name of your contact will be <person> . your code name will be --
<person> , this is difficult , but we ' ve all had our moments . i tried --
stop . you experimented in college .
what a lovely hat , mrs . <person> . it goes quite well with your head .
<person> ! oh , <person> !
no -- i lived in alaska . your dad lives in auburn . <person> as i know . we could look him up in the phone book . wan na try ?
all right .
new year ' s eve . would you go out with me ? !
yes . but not as a date date .
abortion ? no . that we won ' t do .
it ' ll work . <person> ' t no sin to abort a demon .
i know where you can find any number of naked girls who ' d love to hop on board .
<person> , you were right . all the naked girls in the world mean nothing . it ' s the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love .
truth is i usually get along better with animals than with people . in nepal the villagers call me ' kin-tan-tee ' , which means ' man who is loved by many animals . . who love him a lot , too . and so on . ' <person> stares dreamily at healy , smitten .
would you like a glass of tea or something ?
<person> pack my things and meet you downstairs .
and to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight .
<person> . i ' ve got ta talk to you .
<person> ! <person> , i ' m up against it today .
it ' s just us now .
i know .
well you look great . are you married , do you have kids ?
nope , nope -- dodged a few bullets . god , i can not believe i ' m standing here with <person> .
rust ?
as a color , not as rust . you know , a rust colored paint or wood ?
i . given the limits of your question , that ' s correct .
the <person>s were not negligent .
you too .
a vacation from my problems . you bet i will !
<number> for war . <number> for principle . <number> for profit -- mostly . why did you sign with hughes , knowing what he was ?
`for profit -- mostly . '
hey , listen , no one ' s getting replaced . this is <person> we ' re talking about . <continued_utterance> it doesn ' t matter how much we ' re played with . what matters is that we ' re here for <person> when he needs us . that ' s what we ' re made for . right ?
pardon me . i hate to break up the staff meeting , but they ' re here !
guess i kind of lost it there .
you could say that .
<person> bull .
<person> , i ' d like to speak to dr . <person> . this is his babysitter .
the chiefs are looking for a provocation out there . the president ' s going to come under enormous pressure . you have to keep ' em on a short leash , <person> . mcnamara spares <person> a short , nasty look .
you must think i ' m blind and stupid . i ' ve already gotten the birds and bees from <person>by . the president doesn ' t have to double-barrel me .
they haven ' t done much for you . hardly anything . you do what you think is right !
<person> , i ' ll make my own decisions ! i got along very well in the army without you !
what ' s that for ? it feels cold .
new ports are sometimes a bit tight . <person> ' t want to hurt you .
have you ever thought that <person> doesn ' t want you to have a child ? that ' s why he fucking kills them before they ' re born . because you ' re fucking insane monsters that don ' t deserve a child .
you take that back !
why is that ?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance . she .
at first the police thought he just ran away , but this afternoon dr . <person> found some blood spots on the carpet -
jesus .
why would you assume anything about me ? we just met .
i don ' t know . i guess you just .
i wasn ' t going to fight for you . i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend .
he ' s not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i ain ' t spoken for . not yet that is .
it means she ' s insecure .
about what ?
i have to clear the scene . i ' ve got word direct from the chief baer lights a cigarette , only half listening .
yes , the chief . <person> stuff . any survivors ?
they call it `` ahab '' , it ' s a solar powered submersible . it can circumnavigate the globe on it ' s own . they use it to track and study the migration patterns of whales .
you did say `` ahab '' ? you ' re sure about that ?
well , you are his grandfather . he is supposed to spend some time with you . you ' re supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that .
junior spends time with his child .
fantastic , <person> ! a twenty-seven hundred sale ! ' this job is free ' ! what a beaut ! i ' m out of the slump ! <person> ' s riding high again . <person> ' s back ! we ought to go and celebrate . <person> ' s go to the corral and have a drink . we can turn the paperwork in a little later .
<person> says that ' s where ' <person> ' hangs out .
you like pool ?
i enjoy the game .
your answer to my question . it ' s one thing to have never been injured in your life , but to state that you ' ve never taken ill , well that ' s a whole new level .
<person> ' s been injured .
good afternoon , everyone !
take a moment to catch your breath .
actually , i was curious about how you see things working out , for you , <person> and <person> .
excuse me ?
<person> .
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive .
<person> . <person> the dog .
except my life was no longer normal . there were blinding migranes now . <continued_utterance> . nerve damage . why ? this is how big business operates . a random accident . a `` lifestyle mishap ? '' they are not coincidences . how do you think air-tight contracts are broken ?
. preferably <person> .
nice guy but a loser . lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of <number> . you wan na be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching ? . <person> happened to that cute analyst at thudder , <person> ? .
if i ever need surgery , get me the heart of an arb like <person> , it ' s never been used . <person> .
how do you do mr . <person> . i ' m <person> .
thank you . you are cleared .
janice , how many years have you been buzzing us in ?
it ' s all my fault . if i hadn ' t been so damn smart , if i ' d just . oh <person> , <person> , i ' m so sorry .
<person> , <person> , i don ' t want to talk <person> now .
is that right ? what are the trees saying today ?
they ' re sayin ' that nobody ' s gon na talk to you cuz they don ' t give away one of their own . but they did say there ' s somebody way across the little walking river who wants to talk to you . <continued_utterance> he sent me to find ya . he says he ' s got information .
<person> funny , though , isn ' t it ? we ' re not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
somebody else makes those decisions , not guys like you and me . you ' ve done your job , x , head back to <person> . i ' ll be landing in <number> minutes . this is my operation now .

what are you doing ?
carrying out our mission , mr . secretary . if you don ' t mind , we ' re very busy right now . we need to be able to do our jobs .
in the meantime , we ' ll be watching your line . <person> , <person> ?
<person> .
the symphony of collision .
the only thing i want to hear is your silence .
<person> , i feel for you . it must be tough being a teenager in this house .
my mother wasn ' t any better .
i thought this look like your work .
<person> ' s go . i ' ll brief you in the air .
it ain ' t like playing some muni track in brownsville , is it ?

i ' m sorry . i mean i .

<person> , the thing is , i heard a rumor that this guy i like was gon na ask me .
uh-huh .
my employer requires your services . one job . one day ' s work . <person> dangerous . i don ' t expect all of you to live , but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit .
who ' s your boss ?
you bet your left nut he is ! he asked if i had any lustful thoughts toward my sister .
what did you tell him ?
you actually listen to all those tapes ?
no , i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you . how you feeling today ?
then you ' re in love .
i am .
he okay ?
healthy as can be .
hello .
<person> ?
<person> , <person> -- guess who ? that ' s right , and you know everyday i say to myself , today could be the day . so what do you say . will you marry me ? then please can you get me through to mr . <person> ?
it concerns his future !
and i have to work , i need the money to survive and anyway i love my job . <continued_utterance> but to work i ' ve got ta have a babysitter , and to have a babysitter i need to work , so i run around all day . . and i ' m not sure i ' m taking good care of her .
of course you ' re taking good care of her -- we know what it ' s like , don ' t cry , she looks great .
i love living here . and i refuse to clean up !
no problem .
thanks for your help , <person> .

this drink . i like it .
<person> , it ' s great , isn ' t it ? <person> makes the best coffee in town .
you bought her some time , <person> . <person> ' t never gon na be over . but you bought her some time .
some indian time ?
. work okay ?
. this drug testing is driving my guys nuts . i got flagged for my blood pressure pills . the only good news is , we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff . ' member that crash last summer ? and the investigation ? well , the faa is gon na rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism . i kept telling ' em it wasn ' t maintenance , it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in cincinnati . and i was right .
i don ' t know ! i don ' t know !
leave that rotting piece of meat here . it ' s done its job . let it die .
i am instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed . if this solution were raised at the u . n . by ambassador zorin , he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson .
so i understand you correctly . if the missiles in <person> were dismantled , returned to the soviet union , and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them , the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade <person> ?
what ' s the matter ?
i ' m freezing . i can ' t feel my toes .
if i am going to get through math today , you ' re going to have to bring me up to speed quick .
you didn ' t do your homework ?
j . d . ! just tell me . i know you ' re not some schoolboy . now come on , nobody ever tells me shit .
i ' m just some guy . a guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now .
eli is a fine carpenter . best in the district . he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago .
oh ? what happened to hochstetler ?
yes , it is . <person> , i think it worked .
it totally worked . they opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade .
yup .
i ' d say it ' s working .
-we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal .
but you ' re not dismissing me .
i ' m going to have you disbarred . i ' m going to have your ticket . you know what you did ? do you know what you did ?
it ' s all right , <person> .
what ?
that we ' re going back . i don ' t want it to end . i don ' t want to be what i was when i left .
-the what ?
meet me down the street from his place . you got bolt cutters ?
make yourself at home . the refrigerator ' s loaded .
<person> .
what interesting flowers , <person> . who are they for ?
uh , mrs . saunders .

how am i gon na do that ?
the chairs .
i left a message . i think it ' s going to be okay .
of course they are !
do you know what it took for most of them to get here ?
i don ' t think you do . but you say you saw <person> die . i think you ' re covering his ass and he ' s still out there somewhere . i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he ' s using you because you ' re stupid and you think he ' s your friend . you tell me he ' s dead , so be it . i want to make sure he ' s dead before i go back to new york .
he wasn ' t behind anything . it was the lawyer .
then <person> was right about a russian connection .
they ' re getting their weapons from the russians , but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons ? i can ' t help thinking . the person close to king , the one who switched that pin .
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it .
a hundred and . now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk : i don ' t care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller . you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <continued_utterance> what ' d you say to me !
you just keep looking around , that ' s all .
no , i was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments , actually . <continued_utterance> i ' ve actually got to confess to you , <person> . that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that i ' ve been kind of unable to write . on account of the fact that i was in jail for a little while .
doing some ad hoc dope seizures for <person> . still love taking the occasional door down .
you were born for the street fritz . i never featured you for the suit and tie set .
and ?
and <person> wants to trade the missiles in turkey .
well , here we are , eh ?
<person> ! <person> up !
she moved to <person> twelve years ago . i checked directory assistance down there and she ' s not listed . she might ' ve moved ten times since then .
all you want is a phone number ?
that could take days . i need to do something now . <person> ' t you see ? she wants us dead .
<person> , alright . <person> calm . you opened this door . there ' s got to be a way that you can close it .
<person> mean him . its <person> concerns me .

i ' ll be all right . you just do as i say .

<person> - i ' m getting something .

the ozone must be fully depleted on <person> .
you think my dad would have been like that if i knew him ? you think he would have bought me a stadium , instead of teaching me how to play ball ?
i don ' t know . i have no idea .
you have to stop .
fan works .
now what ?
<person> , you shamuses are a tough audience , but what happened to you that was so dark , lurid , embittering ?

trying to figure out what ' s wrong with my fricking back-up system .

jake never gives me more ' n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he don ' t want me goin ' anywhere .

where ' s my car ? what happened to my car ?
oh , <person> ? you know , last semester , what i said that time in office hours-i hope there ' s no hard feelings .
no .

they tell me you ' re an american agent .
there ' s a bus at nine .

<person> . i didn ' t realize it ' d been so long .

oh shit , i can ' t take this anymore !
<person> didn ' t kill <person> . why do you wan na do this ?
he tried to kill him twice before . that ' s a good place to start don ' t ya think ? <person> was on the other side , wasn ' t he ?
why are you like this ? because bond is dead ? it ' s what you wanted .
of course .
i wonder who they are . their hats are really great , aren ' t they ?
their hats ? i ' m sorry , but when that one guy cut the other guy ' s head off , my first thought wasn ' t , `` gee , what a great hat . ``
hungry sanderline ?
if they got shrimp .
<person> dollar .
you ' re a thief , <person> .
well , i think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his lincoln . he ' s giving my mom a joyride in it now . but he ' ll be back this afternoon , so i would come back then . he ' s pretty stubborn . you might have to beat it out of him .
that can be arranged . in the meantime we ' re leaving the piece of shit in the driveway . with a note .
i was studying the bus description . and i just . i got on the wrong bus -- i mean i missed my stop --
i don ' t care , <person> . i ' m just so glad to see you . !

<person> . i know a gun when i see one . and that ' s a gun .
when do i get time for me ?
you don ' t . that ' s the point . <continued_utterance> <person> , none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself . some of us remember how your father --
mcmanus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .
what call ?
what do you mean ?
<person> saw crayons as phallic symbols . when i asked for skinny crayons , it was a personal assault on his manhood .
no , men . there is a woman too , of course ! she looks after my house for me . she is sixty-two years old . - much older than you are . <person> , relieved , starts to comb her wet hair into a new arrangement .
how do they wear their hair ?
i ' m sorry , only relatives can visit patients .
but . i ' m his wife .
i . i just want you to be happy , <person> .
but i think i ' d be happiest . with you .
in season . yeah .
i hate you .
what was that ?
my office was on the other side of the building back then . you don ' t remember me do you ? <continued_utterance> i had red hair . <continued_utterance> i think you were a little younger than <person> when it happened . did you know we changed the conduct rules of the pool because of you ? <continued_utterance> the kids still talk about it like some ghost story . `` did you know there was a kid that almost drowned in the pool ? he got pneumonia and almost died . `` the nurse shakes her head . <continued_utterance> we let them tell it . it helps keep them safe . <continued_utterance> are you still phobic of water ?
i will !
where are we going ?
i mean it , now .
i said ' <person> , ' didn ' t i ?
you are incredibly brave . i have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling . i ' ve lived like this for years , so i ' m used to it . every day when i get up , i think it might be my last . but it makes you appreciate life . and the moment . because that may be all you have . <continued_utterance> to pull this cover story off , we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other . the enemy can spot a fake easily . <continued_utterance> you see what i mean ? that reaction would give us away in a second . <person> to relax .
it ' s just that . it ' s been sixteen years since anyone but <person> did that , i --
how is the garden doing ?
i need to get out there and get those weeds out .
well , the answer ' s ' no . ' i ' m going to make this marriage work . no fights .

<person> ' t you like to be pregnant ?
what ? oh sure . maybe . no . i dunno . <person> , there ' s been something bothering me for a long time .
let ' s try .
you won ' t get the harness on .
there ' s some folks i want to keep tabs on . <person> , tattooed , uncivilized . your kind of people .
what do i get out of it ?
maybe she ' s allergic to something ?
or maybe she ' s hungry again .
you ' ll be a wise king .
there will never be a wiser king than you . or a better father . <continued_utterance> i have much to learn . i know that now . but some day , perhaps , i will make you proud .
yep . for the hose . but while you was gone i replaced a gasket . that ' s going to run you another fifty .
i didn ' t tell you to replace any gasket .
go ahead . <person> . my men will still steal the bomb , and the shot will bring them directly to you . <person> gestures into the pit .
who ' s paying you to destroy the pipeline ?
ah , i got a date tonight with that <person> girl i told you about .
the sawbones ?

i demand answers .
ok . bye <person> .

<person> , are you telling me you don ' t know where <person> lives ?
some apartment somewhere . but i ' ve never seen it .
<person> . if a person can ' t get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins , at least he ought to be able to choose his own name . . and i wan na be called <person> !
fine . and you can call me . . <person> . <person> marie .
i just got it fixed .

i mean , what are you doing in town ?
thank you .
by the way , <person> went to sleep in his room tonight .

<person> ' s missing !
no one ' s going to kill you if [ you do what you ' re told . ] we ' re visiting e . i . o . for some new tests . now get in , or do we start playing rough ?
no ! it ' s not my fault ! you can ' t do it ! <continued_utterance> wait a minute , i remember --
it ' s the official scout magazine . tells about what it means to be a scout , what kind of boy you need to be , and , oh , about merit badges and stuff like that .
' suggested good turns a scout can do : assist a foreign boy with some english grammar . <person> put out a burning field . give water to a crippled dog . ' i could do those .
another !
<person> , brother ?
and he chose <person> , which quite frankly is something i just don ' t understand .
go get `em , son .
depends on what you call love . i grew up on a reservation . a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . that ' s where they stick indians , <person> . that ' s where they leave us to die . my brother killed himself when he was <number> cause he couldn ' t take it anymore . there ' s no hope there . <person> was my ticket out . <person> and me .
is that why you ' re with him ?
i hear things . it ' s hard to surprise me . <continued_utterance> and what else ?
<person> said that i ' m your bodyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety .
i am not a stupid <number> -year-old girl --

let me , let me , yeah ! <person> , you <person> .
no .
hey .
how are things goin ' out there ?
<person> afternoon .
<person> ? <person> ' t inspire a lot of confidence .
what are you talking about ?
i don ' t know . i . maybe this is . last year i sort of thought you were possibly interested in that . idea . but i was the one who , you know , wasn ' t `` ready '' at that point -- so that ' s why i thought things kind of slowed down with us .
he just never struck me as the marrying type , that ' s all .
who are you talking about ?
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for <person> ' s murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life . no thanks .
he was a <continued_utterance> ask you what ? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next ?

then you ' ll see who ' s really holding on to you .
you ' re amazing .
he made us all snowcream , like he said .
stop that , honey .
what are you doing ?
you ' re a dead man , macready -- or a dead whatever the hell you are ! <continued_utterance> we found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn .
<person> , i ' m a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ' s , now it ' s mine . i run my little business , i stay out of trouble .

you know how i feel about texas . we ' re not going that way .
i know , <person> , but we ' re running for our lives ! <person> ' t you think you could make an exception just this once ? ! i mean , look at the map . the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas !

that ' s pretty simplistic , don ' t you think ?
hey , pal , you don ' t start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens .
i ' m afraid it ' s too late , lad . i ' ve just paid thirty guineas for him .
<person> , i ' ll get you money . i will , i ' ll get you money . i ' ll . i ' ll work for it ! i ' ll work for it .
i never killed anybody before . i talk a good game , but i ' m not like that .
sure .
you never said anything . about the drapes .
they look nice .
i finally got hold of may . she was over your sister ' s .
oh , i forgot .
<person> --
because i ' m at the edge of my capabilities , <person> .
no . i really don ' t . <continued_utterance> look , we ' re all concerned with what ' s best for <person> so i ' m hoping we can settle this in an amicable way .
so do we .
oh no , <person> !
what ?
<person> . slayer of <person> . y ' got stones showing up this far south .
what happened to your face ?
sort of shorthand .
shorthand . really ?
no , but i figure now ' s a real good time to start . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t say anything . <continued_utterance> just keep quiet .
i have to answer him .
never .
and she was a little more than pissed about it .
i ' m sorry , he ' s not in . may i take a mess . tomorrow when , two o ' clock . i ' ll check my book . <continued_utterance> yes . mr . <person> ' s clear at that time . the bishop ' s office , tomorrow , the fifth at two p . m . thank you .
that ' s the call that i ' m waiting for .
yes , it is . so what do we do ?
we let him stay . i don ' t know , do we even have a choice ?
that ' s not a bear . that ' s just some lines on a skin .
it ' s not a real bear . it ' s a `` representation '' of a bear . you know , a `` picture . ``
<person> ? ! ? what are you doing here ?
is that any way to say hello ?
<person> ! that ' s not why we ' re here .
oh yeah ? i left the country because of him . . and i came back because of him . and now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse ' s ass on a midnight tour of managua . what are we doing here ?
yes i do . your son is a material witness to a homicide .
you don ' t understand , we have nothing to do with your laws !
you don ' t see what ' s going on here , do you ? there ' s four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas . <person> have been lost . no suspects have been named . so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . that the fbi didn ' t do its job .
and they want to blame us ?
you two don ' t like me , do you ?
we don ' t have an opinion on you .
abraham , i ' m a little worried about the city being destroyed .
their fate is sealed . but for my faith and devotion , the self-same <person> has given unto me the whole of this land , from the jordan to the negev , from the river of egypt to the great euphrates . this did he grant to me and my seed .
even though i couldn ' t afford the antenna fifteen upgrade , i figured out a method of virtual porting that i thought might .
you won ' t need it tonight . everything ' s provided for .
what are you talking about ?
i really did think i was still in reality . at least , until now . beam me up , <person> !
you ready for your big coming out party ? everybody ' s dying to meet you .
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
say it .
<person> . i take it back .
got the touch ?
yeah . still moldable , too .
oh , come on , rachel . no way .
there is always a way ! but you are such a . a glotzkopp you can not see ! you ' d rather go back to that city ! to nothing ! no woman ! no children ! no land !
well , spit it out .
the fact is . we ' d like you to give <person> another chance .
it ' s not like i didn ' t have ideas , i had plenty of ideas . but i never even shared them with your father .
what kind of ideas ?
sometimes it gets exciting out here .
what do you think ?
exactly . but don ' t expect everything all at once . even a baby occasionally falls and hits his head .
<person> step around the office . <person> step around the office ! <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> : hi fam ! he ' s a genius !
<person> . thirty seven . single . member of the tribal council .
<person> like <person> wasn ' t fast enough to outrun that load . what do you make of the damage ?
oh , great . disarmed my ass .
we ' ve come to arrest you . <person> your arms ! <continued_utterance> hold ! i don ' t want that !
i know . but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
<person> , of course . i was worried when i didn ' t hear from you that night .
what ?
some fruit . <continued_utterance> no .
you told me so . maybe you ' d get some sympathy . you came to the wrong place .
and what makes you so tough ?
so you wouldn ' t have any idea where he might be ?
have you tried <person> ? <person> ' s very nice this time of year .
i think so .
why ?
we are so in ! she ' s eye-knowing us like crazy .
you ' re gon na love <person> . trust me . it ' s crazy . this morning , i almost got a handie behind that pita stand .
dr . <person> , isn ' t it ? dr . alvin <person> ?
<person> .
hey .
hey , your . what the hell happened to you ?
<person> . that was part of the problem .
who ' s car did you steal ?
yes . but it was terrible .
really ? have you seen our show ? <continued_utterance> what was your favorite act ?
now what ' s the problem ?
the problem is i don ' t happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .
i ' m sorry -- <continued_utterance> what ' re you doing ? ! have you lost your mind ? !
you came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england .
the hell i don ' t .
you have acquaintances -- business friends and superficial golf buddies . you have always been a fringe player . you have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
<person> is a dish best served cold . well , it ' s payback time , sport . . see that building ? i bought into it ten years ago . it was my first real estate deal . i sold it a couple of years later and made an $ <number> , <number> dollar profit . it was better than sex . at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world . now , it ' s a day ' s pay . i had a mole in <person> ' s employ . gave me half the picture , then he got fired .
i don ' t understand .
<person> and i are both a little concerned about the neighborhood response -- what is this fabric ? does it have a name ?
money . its name is money .
and you chased one ?
something came over me , i just had nail him , no matter what the risk . it was pretty hairy . i thought he had me , a couple of times . but i really can ' t take credit . . .
that ' s right .
<person> , do you remember a carswell fensterwald ?
something like that .
but the white dot in the middle ; that ' s got to mean something .
oh , the usual one . `` must return immediately to earth .
i don ' t have a wife . well , i do - but not a real wife . <person> . look . someone else sent that note . someone who --
will you quit shouting !
when did this fucking package fucking arrive , <person> ?
you know what i do , <person> ? i pick certain houses that are strategically located , we put up the aluminum siding , and for every referral , for every person who sees this quality job that we do . sees how beautiful it is . i give you two hundred dollars .
two hundred dollars ?
<person> , check out <person> , it ' s still not over .
<person> .
<person> check everything the chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it . no one ' s to know about this but <person> . i need redundant control over what happens out there . and if things aren ' t as advertised , you ' re going to make sure they come out the way i want them to come out , starting with this low level flight thing .
that ' s going to be tough . you know how these guys are about their chains of command .
what did she say ?
that she thought we were married .
that ' s just the impression you have ! i tell you it ' s only shock ! <continued_utterance> take it easy , boy !
<person> ' t leave me ! everything is going round and round !
yes , sir .
the president has instructed me to pass along an order to you . you are not to get shot down .
parents still together ?
yes .
i had to . you saw how he ran . would have given us away . i had to .
maybe we ought to . you know , bury him .
gieg , <person> .
<person> , meet us out front when you ' re through . if they try to take anything away from you like <person> up there , just make a list and we ' ll have ' em send it down to the boat .
forget the shooter , boss . i lose ' em for you .
lose them ? in this ?
why ?
i ' m better than that .
with all the respect i can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories , <person> , trust me - you ' ve crossed that bridge .
<person> . <person> your dinner .
<person> <person> . are you sure ?
<person> ' . <person> ' came in today at all .
we saw it everywhere in dorsey nader ' s game store , remember ?
yes . so that makes it the game- life version of our own company . <person> is equivalent to <person> in the real world .
why ?
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex . i think you ' re gon na need one tonight .
thats right . could have a bad accident , though . before . durin . or after a hold-up .
whats gon na happen when he sees me drivin the car tomorrow ?
i think she ' s a republican .
i can ' t help myself . <person> pats him . frank what about you ? is there someone else ?
i heard you pounding . i came to tell you .
how do you open that panel ?
do you still love your husband ?
yes .
<person> lost <person> .
oh , yeah ? you ' ll be callin ' soon and maybe i ' m not gon na be there .
you jerking off or just pissed ?
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply ?
. no . no . no .
<person> bought this beautiful antique <person> .
do you mind if i have a word with him alone for a minute .
what ? ! what ' d i do ?
yeah . well , that ' s what i wan na do , so --
well but -- are you gon na come back to say good-bye ?
shut up ! they got wind of something they don ' t like !
oh shit !
uh huh . and what do you --
i mean i took him to play pool ! it was a little clandestine thing we did for fun ! it wasn ' t like a big secret , i mean who cares ? i was actually trying to be nice to him . but he ' s so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin ' squeal on me and i have to listen to your fuckin ' shit all day when i didn ' t even fuckin ' do anything !
<person> ' t say that . we don ' t know that for sure .
who else could it have been ? it was probably around <number> --
i don ' t have three months .
it takes time to find the proper collection .
i ' m sure a lot of you already know . <continued_utterance> palmer , you and copper tie everyone down . <person> tight .
what for ?
i don ' t know what you ' re asking ?
you ' re skill .
<person> , hey , it ' s been a while . <person> for you at the ten year reunion . you missed out . three days at the disneyworld hotel . <person> ourselves silly . <continued_utterance> couple of your old flames were there . you remember <person> , with the knockers . <continued_utterance> blew up like the goodyear blimp . <continued_utterance> but check this .
<person> . i ' m in some trouble . i need an attorney and you ' re the only one i know . so i figured i ' d start here .
that ' s your way , not mine .
that ' s <person> ' s way !
we ' ll ground her , clip her wings a bit . <person> and scheduled activities and that ' s it until further notice . this has to be handled delicately . <person> , in the district attorney ' s office , will probably help us out , quietly . <person> , this could be embarrassing .
<person> , this is difficult , but we ' ve all had our moments . i tried --
uh , sure . <person> .
i have only one concern . <continued_utterance> you do like girls , don ' t you ?
secretary of defense .
<person> !
<person> ! i ' m heading out the door .
but <person> , i can ' t find him !
. <person> .
<person> ! . i ' m gon na ask ya a few more questions now . ya think you ' ll be able to answer ' em ?
<person> .
what ?
i would have been laughed right out of xenia .
no one will be laughing at you now , ted . you can take that to the bank .
<person> , what ' s the matter with you ? tell them the truth . we ' re married , we have a daughter --
i don ' t know what this crazy bitch is on . you should just cut her loose , so we can get down to business .
<person> ' s see . they ' re not very imaginative ?
' <person> ' m just like dynamite . and when i go off , somebody gets hurt .
stop .
<person> !
. please , officer , please don ' t .
<person> !
ted , it ' s your dad . i have a question for you . i don ' t know how to put it tactfully . you know i ' m lousy with words .
just say it , dad .
what ' s your name , son ?
<person> .
are you going uptown ?
yes .
he sells aluminum siding ? i don ' t believe it . of all the people that could run into me , it has to be a fucking tin man . how come i don ' t know him ?
you musta seen him . he hangs out with <person> , cheese . you know , that group .
<person> .
<person> , i appreciate , you know , the concern and all , but like he said , i can take care of myself .
part of him is .
if we find <person> , <person> won ' t be far behind .
are we done now ? you ' ve got nothing on me . so if you ain ' t booking me , i ' m walking .
you ' ve got this wrong . you ' re not under arrest , you ' ve been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .
i guess if a man lives long enough , he gets to see everything . and i mean everything . what else do you have in your bag of tricks , mr . <person> ?
frankly , <person> , i can ' t see giving much more . if you have any suggestions i ' ll be glad to listen .
he ' s sitting in my waiting room .
<person> , listen pal , this is not the time to long that stock , you know what i mean ?
so what do you make of it ?
you know damn well what we both make of it .
<person> ?
i think there ' s a lot of truth in that . i ' m gon na pursue some options . i want to join that <person> thing .
would walter really press charges ?
it ' s within the realm . he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously . and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning .
what kind of stuff do i bring ?
i don ' t know . warm stuff , i guess . it ' s the mountains . i guess it gets cold at night . i ' m just gon na bring everything .
what is it , <person> ? you haven ' t the guts ?
you spineless paper tiger - <continued_utterance> where is she , <person> ? ! ? or did you kill her like paris ?
forget it , just the coffee .
<person> ?
mr . <person> . it ' s too bad your client didn ' t show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney . <continued_utterance> lately the only variation i ' m hearing in your argument is the name of the client . and you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of illinois v . <person> , but you aren ' t going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants . furthermore , there is no sacred protection of property rights in the united sates . when you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm , whether it ' s one joint or an acre of plants , your property can be seized and your property can be sold .
i ' m sorry the court finds my argument repetitious .
did she have someone with her ?
right . she had a friend with her . the friend took off .
why what ?
why does he belong with us ?
i agree . if there has been a coup , and there ' s a hard-line government in power now , then it doesn ' t matter what we say . the end of the day we ' ll either agree to their terms , they ' ll agree to ours , or we ' ll go to war . but what if there hasn ' t been a coup ? what if . what if what is happening is a series of accidents ?
the second letter is an accident ?
what c- <number> . was <person> talking about ?
let me put it to you this way . whether i ' m here . or whether i ' m not . i ' m leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
<person> . we ' ll work it out .
well . i could use a beer .
why ?
i ' m not worried ?
what was here , mr . <person> ?
a trailer was here . what the hell do you think ?
`` the great went '' .
here we go again . like we ' re back at one eyed <person> .
<person> <person> . heavy duty medicine .
<person> . as in medicine man ? <continued_utterance> why does he wan na see me ?
i need to go out .
to see your father ?
you do ?
i can ' t think of anyone i ' d rather lie here with . <continued_utterance> <person> maybe <person> . if <person> were here , what do you suppose he would do to me ?
i ' ll bet you a thousand dollars against my car that i can beat you in any game -- any game , you name it -- with a seven iron .
this is ridiculous .
you stopped breathing !
why did you kill him ? it was the next bit i really .
<person> has invited <person> and me to see the work he ' s been doing .
<person> ! playing in a pool all day long ? squandering his birthright on a group of fawning strangers ? i consider this your fault , <person> !
the only fight we ' d ever have is what video to rent on saturday night .
who fights about that ?
is everything ready ?
yes , <person> .
she ' s very pretty .
she is . i knew she would be . she had to be .
hey , you want to hear a joke ? i got a joke . why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
chill out --
it needs no cleaning .
no , of course not . kind of makes you wonder though -- the guys who built it , did they just die the minute they finished , or did the gods give them a second to get out ?
<person> , listen , can i .
sure you can , no problem . <person> , i got ta go now , i ' m gon na see if she ' ll share a cab with me . you take the shuttle , okay ?
and the address ?
<number> oakridge drive .
can ' t hurt . and i think it ' s important you find out what she wants .
are you humoring me ?
but that dog ' s a champion !
get his rifle back .
<person> steps to the hall . <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s the catskills , isn ' t it ?
<person> .
there ya go . always remember , focus on the peach .
. not the pit .
but the captain ordered you hard to starboard .
twice .
your what ?
i mean , where are our real bodies ? are they all right ? are they hungry ? what if there ' s danger ?
you know how it is , sir . some of these red-asses are a bit prejudiced .
prejudiced ? against what ?
<person> , fred , you can ' t give away all those .
forget it . i got vegetables coming out my ears . usually the varmints eat up half my crop , but lately i ain ' t so much as <continued_utterance> we playing cards tonight ?
again : what is the magician ' s weapon ?
his will .
slovo ? <continued_utterance> <person> , what are you doing here ?
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
dr . <person> ?
mandrakis . it ' s okay . everyone gets it wrong the first time . you ' re <person> ? come on in .
the americans have their money . i left it all for them .
what about <person> ' s money ?
so who ' s washing your car this weekend , mr . <person> ? the senior car wash , remember ? <person> ' s making a schedule . she said you bought a coupon but you ' re not on anybody ' s list .
well , you know . figured i ' d buy a washing ticket , support the effort . that old jeep of mine ' s kind of a waste of time , don ' t you think ?
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting .
is that what you ' d like me to do ?
yes it does . the fairy queen told me .
the fairy queen ? and the baby here ' s a princess ? and these two rodents are your guides ? <continued_utterance> yeah well . in the morning i think i ' ll be on my way .
maya ? ! what are you doing here ?
i had no choice . i ' m a slave , remember ?
i would not have exiled him to a world of mortals , stripped of his powers , to suffer alone . i would not have had the heart for such cruelty !
that is why i ' m king . <continued_utterance> i , too , grieve the loss of our son . but there are some things that even i can not undo .
<person> , buddy . thinking big is fine . . but you shouldn ' t forget where you come from , either .
you know , you ' re absolutely right . would you mind sitting over there ?
no . no . no . no . i had my child at cedars and sinai . and that ain ' t no county hospital . you have to have cash or check before you come in the door .
some folks take that natural stuff too far .
what is it ?
it ' s trouble , that ' s what . not that i give a damn , but you ' re playing with dynamite with those two and you ' re gon na blow all of us up . <person> is the meanest sonofabitch i ' ve ever met .
all right , say you ' re right , say you don ' t get yourself killed . there ' s something else . it ' s too late for <person> , he already rolled his bone . but it ' s not too late for you , morg .
what ' re you talkin ' about ?
it was me , what ?
you amped the neural connectors back up , didn ' t you ? you ' re the reason the convict died .
bottom hose was shot too . <person> clear through . had to put a new one in . runs like a dream now . bobby how much ? <continued_utterance> well . you got your parts , you got your labour . let ' s call it a hundred-fifty bucks .
how much ! ?
oh sure , <person> .
who are these orphans , anyway ?
you ' ll never believe who called me , <person> . <person> !
what ? ! ? why ?
beethoven . he ' s coming hard , just like we planned . i want you to angle out , hit , and move .
<person> out , hit , and move .
i don ' t see the connection .
the connection is , it did a head number on him . he ' s petrified of cars . <person> ' t drive . i ' ve known him all my life , and he ' s never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle . he rides passenger and he rides horses , and that ' s it . the man that shot <person> down was behind the wheel of a moving car .
but <person> --
please .
<person> ' t worry about it , all right ?
<person> , i hate sounding so clinical all the time . all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well , but then i .

he can wait .
that was our insurance company ' s recommendation .
yes . it would be .
i need to find my daughter . i ' ll pay you .
who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i shouldn ' t just put you in a dumpster ?
you better be careful . you ' ll get a stroke arguing .
i wouldn ' t care if i drop dead if he learn something from it . <person> , you make me wish i was dead .
no <person> ' s . a- <number> , <person> .
<person> ?
wow . are you going to ?
i don ' t know . if he ' d ' ve asked me this time last year i would have probably said yes . but the minute he said it , i don ' t know , i felt like somebody was trying to strangle me .
i accept full responsibility .
well , good , that ' s settled .
what for ?
to find out if he knows anything . if you think he does , you got ta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped .
call ya later .
and you glad you married me ?
stop . <continued_utterance> how do i look ?
like a king . <continued_utterance> it ' s time .
right . now it ' s used by somebody from the juarez cartel , one of his lieutenants . who knows ? every damn day there ' s birthday party . at first i thought they must have three hundred children , then i realized they ' re taunting us . three miles away and we can ' t touch them . ha , ha , ha .
who do we interface with on their side ?

<person> .

sometimes kill the crew ; other times - torture them .
i ' m sorry .
i mean anybody . <continued_utterance> i heard what <person> said to you . he said , `` we have enemies in our own house . `` he said it as he was dying .
i don ' t think he died . i mean , do you ? i think he maybe fainted . <continued_utterance> that was <person> , head of publicity and marketing , at antenna hq . <continued_utterance> . on that very expensive pink- fone you threw away . <continued_utterance> he said that some bizarre fanatical group called the anti- existenzialists has put a price of <number> million dollars on your head , payable to anybody who kills you . it ' s been released to all the media now . everybody knows about it .
just ' cause i ain ' t got eyes doesn ' t mean i can ' t see .
that a fact ?
it ' s too big a spread .
it ' s that fucking lunatic again . <continued_utterance> can you believe this guy ? is he sane or what ?
i wan na go home now .
<person> , look , i know you feel bad . i know it ' s harder to talk here than in your room , but we need to get it on tape . just tell us what you told us before . tell us the truth .

he lived through that ?
he ' s an asshole ! ' i heard you ' re not ready yet . ' ' we ' re gon na kick your ass . ' well , we may be behind schedule , but we ' re still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe i haven ' t scored with <person> yet , but neither has he . she ' s not an easy lay , that ' s what i like about her . you know what they say : it ain ' t over till it ' s over . <person> and <person> go into the living room . <person> is picking up glasses . <person> is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket .
well , i didn ' t do so well either -- i blew it with <person> . i don ' t even know how .
you are not carrying me inside .
<person> on .
. <person> , i enjoy my classes , especially the ones that are advanced , but i ' ve been feeling a little restless lately . it ' s hard to explain .
well , you ' re probably bored . not being challenged . your application was very good , <person> , but we have many boys who want to go to <person> . not everybody is comfortable at a prep school .
am i married ? what kind of a question is that ? how can you ask me that ? <person> ' t you know me at all ? oh wait , i get it . your friends are telling you the reason we haven ' t met is that i ' m married . am i right ? <continued_utterance> so he didn ' t exactly answer .

you think i killed him ? cuz he was an apple ? well , let me tell you something about <person> , <person> --

but you ' re crazy about him --
excuse me ?
it ' s from the godfather . when the movie producer realizes that <person> is the emissary of <person> -- <person> is staring at him . joe -- just before the horse ' s head ends up in his bed never mind --

<person> ' t you hear me ? girard --
sit . <continued_utterance> your father was a proud man . and he had a right to be . i never knew one as brave or as kind . he knew that his strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor . that is why he dedicated his life to his country and his king . that is why he gave his life , for both . <continued_utterance> i watched you this morning and saw someone i knew . you have your father ' s heart , his will to fight , his courage . but these gifts have no value unless they are given . <continued_utterance> it ' s time for you find your fortune with men as brave and as bold as you are . in paris . with the king ' s musketeers . you ' ll need this .

the king pipeline .
and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it .
it ' s transparent . the press ' ll be all over it .

we got you on tape making the deal . we got you bragging about the quality . we got you bragging about your business . we got you . <continued_utterance> one chance here , <person> . make us believe you got a boss . no boss , it ' s all on you .
it ' s a death sentence . i ' ll never make it to the trial .
<person> ?
well , i don ' t want to . i mean , couldn ' t we just . i mean , could we give it a rest ?
landon . to save your life , you have to either go deaf or go numb in your dick and balls .
i ' m thinking .
do you think this is funny ? some kind of joke ? you lost six people out there .
i don ' t think one second of this is funny , sir .
it looks that way .
you know what that would mean ? <continued_utterance> to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he ' ll testify ?
that perfume you ' re wearing , antonia . it wouldn ' t happen to be cristaile , would it ?
why yes . how did you know ?
<person> , if it achieves your aim of de- stabilizing the western world . <continued_utterance> <number> . what do you know of the caspian sea ?

<person> , what are you doing ?
well , i dunno what you ' re gon na do , but i ' m giving suicide serious consideration this time .

last night i read rudy the story of winnie the pooh and the honey pot . know what happened : he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung .
maybe you ought to read him pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .
what happened to you ?
one minute you ' re defending the whole galaxy . . and suddenly you find yourself suckin ' down darjeeling with <person> and her little sisters . the headless dolls turn and wave .

you , an army brat ? i don ' t see that one at all . did you join the service as well ?
the amount of money that killed <person> is the same amount as the ransom demand for <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> kidnapped <person> is the same man who killed her father . m looks at the paper , a long time .
it ' s a message . he wants us to know he ' s back .
i ' m sorry . it was a national emergency -
that hardly makes up for the imposition . now , for what i hope will be the very last time - pay attention , <number> . first , computer generated retrograde analysis map . body here , meteorolog- ical influences here , likely vector- ing of the ship ' s coordinates here .
he ' s sealed himself in .
he ' s going to insert the plutonium . <continued_utterance> do you know what you ' re doing ?
what ' s the deal ?
oh come on , don ' t feel bad . you got played , so what ? you ' re new at this . did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out ?
think about it . you walk into a video store and you see <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> since we guarantee you ' ll get every bit as good a work-out .
how do you guarantee that ?
you know . take the pictures ?
i remember the first time you walked into mrs . <person> ' s class in <number> nd grade . <person> gingham dress .
so were you a rehobeth beach family or <person> ?
<person> .

i have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up .

quit fooling around , <person> . this is your dad . is everything okay there ?
<person> ' t be afraid , dad . everything will be okay . you deserve to be loved .
what does that mean ?
the three unions . it ' s <number> % of <person> ' s operating budget , the hourly cost of a flight crew is $ <number> an hour , that ' s the real hidden value g . g . , if you can negotiate that out , get a crew down to $ <number> - <number> an hour a run , this airline is gon na be the hottest thing since <person> .
why are you saying this ?
it ' s all right . no one can hear . we ' ll never get another chance to say it all . <continued_utterance> nothing can ever happen with us , you know . it ' s too dangerous . august will never let me go . you don ' t know what he ' s capable of .
who is . <continued_utterance> <person> ? <continued_utterance> i catch you , right ?
in america the cops catch the crooks , not the victim .
what about <person> ?
he can stay .
you seem to find guns therapeutic . maybe i oughta try it . <continued_utterance> let me guess , some boy didn ' t call and screwed up the weekend . so you ' re taking the day off .
which one of your `` bodyguards '' is that ?
forget him . it ' s not important . i was trying to make a point .
this whole thing was a shakedown . mcmanus what makes you say that ? <continued_utterance> how many times have you been in a line- up ? it ' s always you and four dummies . the p . d . pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time . no way they ' d line five felons in the same row . no way . and what the hell is a voice line- . up ? a public defender could get you off of that .
oh , the uncle is missing .
not <person> ' s uncle but probably the sheriff ' s uncle in federal prison .
we ' ll get twenty years if the cops find this on us ! <person> down the fire escape and hide it . anywhere ! <continued_utterance> hey , whatever you do , don ' t lose the goddamn dope , we got ta be able to return it to those dealers or we ' re dead . those guys are serious .
<person> ' t worry . <continued_utterance> oh , by the way , i put some water up to boil for her bottle .
i believe you would .
why did you say that ?
<person> . this may be a bad time to ask this question but . what if <person> ' s wrong ?
she can ' t be wrong . she ' s a very very very powerful sorceress .
yeah .
when ' s the last time you wrestled ?
i want to stay .
i said come on !
what ?
she can ' t be here without me .
what ?
i said . and do you have kids , too ?
a ghost ?
did you ?
which part ? the colonel ' s ? or yours ?
a piece of advice , mr . <person> : <person> ' t screw with a man who buys ink by the ton . it ' s deadlier than uranium .
things up off the street . <person>s .
like ?
i ' m sure . pretty sure . <continued_utterance> it ' s like the wind . i can ' t see it but i feel it .
we can measure wind .
<person> <person> wouldn ' t tell me what the blue rose meant .
and neither will i .
well , i ' m sorry you can ' t stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again .
yeah . if i want to smoke should i go outside ?
anyone messes with me -- the whole camp goes . <continued_utterance> put those torches on the floor and back off .
the men step backwards carefully .
yeah , why ?
when the hell did this package arrive ?
just relax , dear . now , um . what exactly are we looking at here ?
what do you mean ?
what happened ?
he wasn ' t able to make it .
no problem . just in a little slump here .
<person> ' t try to go walking on me .
oh , <person> , don ' t say that , please , that just makes it worse .
what ? you don ' t love me ? <continued_utterance> me either .
what ' s in the other direction ?
this road , it leads straight to kuwait .
what time is it ? do you think you can just treat us like your slave ?
i tried to call to let you know i was going to be late .
it ' s a bachelor party . you sort of have to do it before the wedding .
i suppose <person> is the creative force behind all this .
why ? ?
how else they gon na make dew drops ?
you don ' t mulder -- you ' ve never needed me . i ' ve only held you back . i ' ve got to go .
you ' re wrong -- he hurries to catch her . as she turns on him .
shit ! i spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap you like ! <person> ' s cheese and <person> ' s crackers and those stupid little french pickles , i forget what they ' re called-
cornichons . i love cornichons .
you know you can always talk to me . right ? whatever is going on in your life , your mom and i ' ll understand .
<person> , dad .
it sure didn ' t come from me . the tone of it in the game was very , very passionate , fanatical . and the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming . the whole thing felt unstable , dangerous , volatile . but worse than that , there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot . <person> game-systems , jumping ship from one game company to another . that kind of thing .
so which one of them did these elements come from ?
he ' d just slow us down , and drink our water . and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he ' d sell us out .
we don ' t leave him , we don ' t take him with us . what does that leave ? <continued_utterance> you ' re out of your mind .
<person> , why don ' t you let <person> work with you . i ' m off to florida at the end of the week for some sun and fun . let <person> work with you , and when i get back , we ' ll see how <person> ' s doing .
i don ' t know . to be honest with you , i think i ' d rather work alone . he ' s too green . is he a pain in the ass ?
you think i ' m after money ? i told you , my friend . <person> . time for a change . <person> is good , but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves .
so all by yourself , you ' re going to destroy every government ; in the world .
you drank a little too much . call me tomorrow if you want .
tomorrow i ' ll wish i was dead .
i don ' t know , <person> . i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow . leave the t . v . on , sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off .
what ' s happened ?
that might have been a possibility , if little miss not-so-bright here hadn ' t started throwing things .
<person> off .
where is <person> ?
<person> is in the kitchen .
if i can smoke it .
you want a muffin ?
temporary derangement . it ' s your best chance . they won ' t believe me .
what do you believe ?
holy shit !
what ' s the matter ?
i ' m not bad , i ' m just drawn that way .
i ' m not complainin ' . but give me credit . i ' m the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
i didn ' t miss it . i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you ' d want to turn back .
so , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?
yep . there ' s some great places nearby .
<person> .
yes . yes . it was your parents who were brave . i make jams .
and you ' ve never done a brave thing in your life ?
outside <person> .
i never heard of it .
different how ? different like a dwarf at a basketball game ? or different like a lesbian in pumps ?
i don ' t get the distinction .
i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago .
what ' s a toby ?
so what i want to do is stop it here . i ' m going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .
all right . but let ' s keep the price down . i ' ve called <person> . he recommends that we continue to respond as if we ' re going to trial .
alright , i ' ll tell you what . you want the commission ? you can have it . and you don ' t even have to take <person> . i ' ll take care of him for free and i ' ll send you the check every month . on one condition .
what ' s that ?
i wish you hadn ' t gotten in the car with that girl .
sofia . i ' m .
you have moments .
tell me which ones are my moments and i ' ll try to duplicate them .
nice of you to turn up .
he ' s got speed . i ' ll give him that . but has he got stamina ?
no , not right now .
every time i listen to <person> , i always remember when i used to work in atlantic city back in the late <number> ' s . you know , a busboy job . <person> used to play at the <number> <person> , and we used to take our dates and say , ' hey , you wan na go and hear <person> ? ' then we ' d just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music . i think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown .
you ' ve had your say , wes . now leave it .
maybe you ' ve got ideas of your own for the gold . maybe you ' ve already got things worked out .
where were you last night ? we were supposed to get together . you didn ' t show up .
you were supposed to show up . maybe i wasn ' t .
she ' ll never make it with all that luggage she ' s got . i got ta give her a hand . <person> at the colors in her hair ! <person> , i ' ve never seen a woman like her before .
<person> , listen , can i .
hi !
hi there ! you alright ?
they ' re holding the lead in the world section for <person> .
it ' s great stuff , isn ' t it ? we ' d go down in a blaze of glory .
<person> . like a plague . no matter how many you pay there ' s always another with his hand out . how did you pick him out ?
he flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink .
i can ' t quite picture you in the back woods of georgia .
where do you picture me , <person> ?
come back ?
never mind .
you found the body ?
uh uh . not me , daddy , i just reported it . it was the kid .
i popped his shoulder .
<person> , breathe .
it didn ' t come up .
well i do . i ' ve always loved you , <person> . i

guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views .
the owl is a messenger . when one shows itself to a sioux . it means someone ' s gon na die . the owl told him about <person> .
the owl told him about <person> . that ' s incredible . i guess we just broke the back of this investigation , didn ' t we ? evidence doesn ' t get any harder than that -- not for my money . is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court ?
<person> the jerk reneged on me . i ' ve got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand ! i ' m tapped out man , american express got a hit man looking for me .

well ? what move , do you think ?
i say we use `` the norn ' s <person> . ``
oh , thank god , you ' re still here ! there ' s been a terrible mistake . that wasn ' t the package you were s ' posed to take . it was another one . i have it right here .
what do you mean ? what other package ?
yes .
did he come in with you ?
he had a hand grenade tied to that . how much longer do you need ?
few more hours . maybe . <person> didn ' t skimp on this thing . i got ta bore right through the face plate . you got some time now , why don ' t you get <person> off my back and go work that <person> broad .
i just didn ' t want to take a chance . i didn ' t want to risk it . it could have been frozen along with everything else .
you had it all figured out . you move into my house . you raise my kids . you sleep with my wife . it was a good plan , <person> .
she ' s left the room before . she always came back . <person> nods . considers this .
so . i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other , and have this baby , right ? <person> .

who ?
<person> . a . k . a .
<person> . what do you think ?
mr . president , you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option . the soviet will only tie you down in negotiation , and leave us short of our goal , the removal of the missiles . negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational , complicating the necessary military task we have at hand . <continued_utterance> for the last fifteen years , i have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet . gentlemen , i do not wish to seem melodramatic , but i do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity . a lesson i have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice . the soviet understands only one language : action . it respects only one word : force . <person> stares at the old man . <person> ' s gaze finds his <continued_utterance> i concur with general taylor . i recommend , sir , air strikes followed by invasion , perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits .

he believes she has the answer .

do you think you won ?
oh really ? are you an expert on this now ? how should i speak to my wife , <person> ?
with the respect she deserves . <person> , i don ' t deny the work you ' re doing here could be important --
what did you tell the watch commander upstairs ?
that this was a random drug seizure . i ' m not using names and i ' m number coding everything . a load of interesting stuff too . i got unregistered fire-arms , more dope than i ' ve ever seen , and some mail from business associates that seems hinky . we should follow up- -here , this one , `hurwitz holdings ' <person> had some real estate dealings-

i saw a movie once . part of it took place in heaven . everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses . like that . at least that ' s the way i remember it . abruptly , <person> glances at his watch . <continued_utterance> i should be going .
<person> . <person> ' t leave just yet . there ' s something i think you ought to see .
<person> . now listen to me , asshole . i ' m giving you a break . but if my partner finds out you ' re here , you ' re gon na be reading rat tracks in sioux falls <person> .
<person> . <person> . i ' m goin ' . <continued_utterance> hey , <person> . <continued_utterance> you weigh one sixty-three , yeah ? not a beer drinker . you ' re one of these tofu and pilaf characters . pack your gun , under your coat -- left shoulder . but you got backup ; a little . <number> , . <number> maybe , in a ankle holster that gives you a right foot drag , shoes are too tight at the toe but , man , they look cool . and that ' s what counts .
he doesn ' t have a choice .
oh , i disagree .
-he ever offer her to you ?
i ' m married !
oh ?
morning , officer .
it ' s incredibly simple .
i feel like i ' m being drawn and quartered . like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction .
<person> , listen up . this is dr . alice sheldrake .
i ' m ship ' s surgeon . i ' m in charge of aches , pains , biology , math and science .
no .
i feel so bad . i had nightmares all night long . they all knew you at that place .
see that . i was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast . but now i guess it ' ll just be her and me . you have your smart mouth to thank for that .
damn it . i guess i ' ll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository .
<person> enough . but <person> ' s on alert and we ' re flying attack planes over their sites , on the deck . there ' s no way for them to know they ' re carrying cameras , not bombs . they ' re going to be shot at , plain and simple . <continued_utterance> i ' m your political advisor , and i ' m giving you political analysis here . this is a setup . the chiefs want to go in . it ' s the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs . they have to go in , and they have to do it right . it ' s that simple .
i ' m gon na protect those pilots .
oh , right . you ' re probably not a virgin anymore . but as far as being a hack , that much is status quo .
what do you want from me ? i ' m trying to be fair . but i can ' t keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up .
is the tape on ?
of course .
i ' ll pass . <continued_utterance> i think you ' d better give your pooch a sip . he looks sick .
that ' s ' cause he ' s dead .
first let ' s see if <person> ' s still out there .
<person> ' t he have a home to go to ?
got ta be from the norwegian camp .
how far ' s that ?
that is a damn lie and you know it . every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . <person> asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you weren ' t a farmer ; get <person> to do it . every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell <person> to do it . <person> , you ought to grow up .
i told you about calling me boy . i ain ' t no boy . <person> , you and <person> got a bad habit of calling me boy . you call me boy in front of my wife . you think i ' m going to fix the roof ? i hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain .
how ' s your pulse ?
i couldn ' t tell you .
. well , she , on the eve of the case . you understand . i think quite frankly she ' s come down with nerves and she ' d like . <continued_utterance> when was that arrived at . ? i , i know what mr . <person> said , but . i . well , i think you ' re making a mistake . i think that you should reconsider ; why don ' t you check with your principals , and i ' ll call you in the . no ? . you . uh . all right . no . that ' s fine . i understand . <person> to bother you at home .
what happened . ? <continued_utterance> what happened , <person> . ?
so whatta you got for me , sport ? why are you here ?
chart break-out on this one here . uh whitewood-young industries . low p . e . explosive earnings . <number> % discount from book . great cash flow . <person> <number> % holders .
hell no , i can ' t do that myself . i ' m blind . <person> ' t you see that ?
i ' m sorry , i didn ' t --
they look . happy .
<person> , more likely .
have a great vacation !
you too .
i already have .
<person> and new york . i ' m going to <person> with you .
i hope this goes quickly . i ' m famished .
<person> !
what ' s with you , <person> ?
i miss my wife ! i miss my chil- dren ! my boy <person> ! he ' s growing up so fast , he even helps me on the farm now ! and little <person> ! if you ever saw her sweet little face you ' d melt <person> , you ' d melt ! or maybe you wouldn ' t . you don ' t know anything about love . you don ' t know anything about any- thing .
yes . so that makes it the game- life version of our own company . <person> is equivalent to <person> in the real world .
that ' s probably fair to say .
<person> , <person> skipped school . have you talked to her ?
no .
you mean , you ' re . you ' re all happy about it ?
very happy - now she won ' t be able to hit us with a broom .
yeah . i know . i ' m with you . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na . i ' m just gon na stop for a little water .
<person> ' t drink up all of yours , ' cause you aren ' t getting any of ours .
-there ' s a body in the trunk-
-burn it .
is anyone there now ?
yeah . <person> . but i think he might be better off at <number> .
<person> , <person> , <person> just called me . she knew you were in n . o . , so they left the city .
did she tell you where she was callin from ?
by who ?
i think <person> or <person> .
if you ' ll just let me - <continued_utterance> <person> ' t hurt me .
hurt you , you sonofabitch ? i could kill you .
i am .
who is he ?
funny you should say `` peachy . ``
i did my homework . your grandfather was a peach farmer .
hello there . looking great . <person> nice .
you ' re late , bro !
well , i don ' t know where <person> intends to stick you . that ' s his problem . maybe in his room . but i ' m warning you , mrs .
<person> .
everything worthwhile .
what did you tell the watch commander upstairs ?
who says i ' m the one that called it off ?
a brick house says you divorced him . i ' ll put you on your honor . bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner . and i ' ll take your word for it . now you tell me the truth . because you can not lie to me . what ' s your name ?
i know . unfortunately he didn ' t fight in vietnam either .
were you friends with him ?
just wanted to let you know you ' re sitting in my chair .
that a fact ?
i guess the surgeon general was right .
he ' s shut out the communication circuit !
what ' s the matter ? . <person> ?
nothing .
what ?
are you glad ? i ' m glad .
<person> ' t you approach mr . <person> <number> , <number> , while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his house had been selected , as one of only <number> homes in the state of maryland , for a free aluminum siding job ?
what ' s the name again ?
<person> ! i know these guys !
<person> ?
and no phone .
or an automobile accident . those cab drivers are maniacs .
<person> ! just in time . <person> up a chair .
<person> hittin ' it awful hard , <person> .
<person> !
no , it ' s okay . i just can ' t believe i left it out in the open like that . crabtree hasn ' t been in here , has he ? poking around ?
i ' m done .
i seem to remember something about a history project that ' s due tomorrow .
i wouldn ' t know . - i ' m just a guard because my `` brother '' didn ' t pull any strings with his friends in the royal court .
<person> , first of all , we ' re not actually brothers -- -
<person> is dead !
what if he ' s not ?
hey !
that ' s the sweat of a man who hasn ' t an honest bone in his body . <person> ' t be offended , lad . a man who ' s got no ethics is a free man . i envy that . <person> , how can i blame you ? that <person> sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , don ' t she ? eh ? jake nudges <person> who smiles a nervous smile . <continued_utterance> she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don ' t think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ?
let him alone .
`` we few , we happy few , we band of brothers ; / for he today that sheds his blood with me/ shall be my brother ; be he ne ' er so vile . / this day shall gentle his condition ; / and gentlemen in england now a-bed/ shall think themselves accurs ' d they were no here . / and hold their manhood cheap whiles any speaks/ that <person> with us upon <person> ' s day ! ''
that was that sicko who kept calling dr . <person> . what about him ?
he ' s dead .
norwegian . jans <person> .
got ta be from the norwegian camp .
<person> , i ' ll get you money . i will , i ' ll get you money . i ' ll . i ' ll work for it ! i ' ll work for it .
i ' m sorry .
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days .
that ' s nice .
<person> , well you just don ' t feed a baby . first you got ta look and see if she has any teeth or not .
why ?
megan ? <continued_utterance> me too .
is she all right ?
the name is so familiar but --
<person> , <person> ' s diving !
do you have any idea who she is ?
um . i ' d rather not say . just yet .
what ' s that ?
like most editors , he really wants to be a writer , but he ' s too busy living a novel to bother writing one .
edie .
i don ' t buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly don ' t believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?
they ' ll catch up eventually .
my father used to hunt in a forest like this . he promised to take me on my tenth birthday . i don ' t know why he picked that year . something about a boy becoming a man . i ' d lay in bed at night and imagine it , just the two of us . but he died before i could go with him .
i know you ' re going to pay me . <continued_utterance> y ' know i finally got rid of the leopard suit thing -- it was so retro , y ' know . it ' s not easy being a post-modern stripper . so . twelve big ones ?
there . with equity and inventory it ' s worth twelve grand . more or less .
well , i --
-- and the courage that you promised <person> ?
many thanks . forgive me for arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise .
<person> ' t be silly . i couldn ' t wait for you to come .
if you ' re looking for <person> , she ' s on the aisle .
no .
it takes a key . he keeps it on himself all the time . i mean <continued_utterance> kill him .
i can ' t kill , <person> . i can ' t kill anybody .
he started to reorganize . i was going to call you . but half-way through , he gave up and fell asleep .
i want to check the set-ups for tomorrow ' s insurance convention . <continued_utterance> give me a shot from his wedding band .
it ' ll come . it needs us . we ' re the only thing left to imitate . give me a hand . <continued_utterance> you and <person> got to block off the west side bunks , the mess hall and the kitchen .
you crazy ? he might be inside already ?
i don ' t know . they killed wes .
why haven ' t they killed us ! ?
i wanted to talk to you . the other guys -
i did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but don ' t think we ' re friends . i ' m sorry , but i have other things -
i mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty .
how would you know ?
oh that ' s bullshit . you don ' t feed a baby like an adult .
oh , really ? and how would you know ?
are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference ?
alphabetically seems . fair .
<person> . it ' s freezing out here . <person> ' s just get in the car and you can tell me what happened .
what are you doing back so soon ? what about hiking to the gas station ?
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics ?
i am on the staff of .
a pot is a pot . we ' ll find some use for it . <person> , where ' s the livestock ?
i make jam . we have no animals .
we ' re getting out of this place . we ' ve done enough .
wait a minute , whoa . we can ' t go now . what ' s <person> got planned with that nerve agent ?
we ' ve touched on this , his own witness has said .
. almost nine minutes . causing brain damage .
i have a key back at the office . i could go get it .
is he ok ?
<person> . i just figured it ' s old .
well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows .
someone from new york . <continued_utterance> about a security job at a museum . they want to hire you . i didn ' t know you guys were moving to new york . thanks for telling me .
we ' re not moving .
<person> . <person> . <person> .
what ?
won him over just like that .
i see .
and what do you think you might have said ?
i think i might ' ve said i was in love with you . <person> ' s face remains . unchanged . grady he told you .
fuck you .
you through ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll ask again . how well do you know the bible ?
the main problem is , <person> , these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders , non-indians . relations have not been amicable .
different culture . <person> to penetrate . the indians don ' t like white cops poking around . and that ' s why we ' re in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent .
how do i look ?
you ' re a vision , <person> , a goddamn vision of loveliness , you always are .
what i admire are the details , the invention , the little lies all around the big one . it takes talent .
oh , it ' s nothing .
i mean it ' s open . anyone ' s got a shot at it . you just got ta get past a local and a sectional qualifier , and unlike doral or colonial or the a . t . t . , they can ' t keep you out . they can ' t ask you if you ' re a garbageman or a bean- picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper . you qualify , you ' re in .
and then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated --
where is <person> ?
she has turned against you .
maybe you should talk to <person> . owns a marine salvage company . nobody knows more about the strait .
where can i find him ?
we ' re going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this . it works the quadriceps .
how long have you been married ?
who , <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' s my dog .
well , i ' m a little muddled . the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east . and there ' s the house , and here you are , and that ' s all . <continued_utterance> . is , are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?
<person> , the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads . do you honestly think <person> ' s practice of word association works ?
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association . the world is a hologram , <person> .
<person> is okay . but <person> , he is the best . he pitches for the baltimore orioles , and some day i will be the second man from nicaragua to play in the major leagues .
<person> had a good fastball , but <person> has a curveball and a screwball that are better .
oh , come on , <person> . cut the kid some slack .
it ' s just ail that crap he spins out . just once i ' d like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth .
<person> ' s a babe !
what ?
<person> did your people get into <person> ?
the house of odin is full of traitors .
one-hundred-thousand ! ? that son-of-a-bitch . grace what do you mean ? bobby if it ' s in a safe we ' d have to get the combination --
it takes a key . he keeps it on himself all the time . i mean <continued_utterance> kill him .
so now you ' re going to tell me where i lost my eyes . you don ' t think i know where i lost my eyes ? i was there when i lost them . i lost them in the war . the war in the joint . there ' s always wars in the joint . cause i was a code talker in the joint and in the war too . <person> , nothing like the smell of a naked lady . be careful , boy .
<person> been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the <number> ' s . this town ' s all inbreeding .
the sitter ' s here . <continued_utterance> we can do this another time if you want ? i ' m fine with anything .
but i put cologne on .
<person> , you old sheep-fucker ! how the hell are ya ?
my name ' s mel .
maybe .
does it have something to do with another guy ? are you in love with him ?
i never said that .
yes you did . last night . to your friend
she looks . i would say she has a little of the coloring of that <person> person .
<person> of the bookstore .
he won ' t be able to do it - he ' s too young - he ' s not even been backed yet .
ted !
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car .
that ' s funny : you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
what kind of infection ?
i don ' t know .
it ' s not up to me .
<person> and <person> said it ' s yours . they seem to think you ' re coming home .
whacking is not of much use on a farm .
now hold on . there ' s a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job .
mr . <person> , wouldn ' t you be more comfortable waiting for my husband outside ?
in the street , mrs . <person> ?
. resourceful !
yes , sir . so we ' d like you to keep your promise to us , if you please , sir .
you got a problem with me going ?
i got a problem with you not doing your job , burbank . you already screwed up once this week .
mr . <person> .
our police are afraid of them . please get them out of here . <continued_utterance> they ' re going to kill me next . that ' s what i hear . these new indians are destroying everything . our people are a quiet people .
but you ' re strong <person> . so much
he ' s in love with a girl who ' s dead . it _is_ dangerous for you to have it . i ' m sorry .
cut the language , will ya ?
it ' s gone ! some . malfunction .
<person> , antonia --
<person> . now that i ' m home .
there . with equity and inventory it ' s worth twelve grand . more or less .
this is how you think you can settle up ? by deeding me your driving range ?
if i give it to you , will you let us go ?
sure . whatever you want . for old time sake . <continued_utterance> looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who ' s better than who , don ' t we , <person> ? like i said ; i expected more from you .
what ?
<person> - soze .
<person> , well , i have to put her to bed now .
you have to put her to bed ? where ' s <person> ' s mommy ?
how ya feelin , <person> ? i heard you wasn't doin too well recent .
<person> fine , thank you . i had a cardiac infarction but <person> on a new diet and exercising regularly . ive never felt better .
you don ' t know anything about ba- bies .
<person> ! but i know a lot of women who do . why , if i had somebody in my life -- a little daughter for instance -- i ' d have a reason to live . <continued_utterance> <person> . you can ' t let me die here . not when i wan na help you .
<person> .
well , <person> , you ' ve done a very good job , but we ' ll take care of it from here . <continued_utterance> we ' ve been following these narco- trafficantes for some time but had not been able to bring them to justice . put the prisoners in the car . impound the truck . <continued_utterance> one question . how did you find about this ?
it feels so . . real .
it ' s better than real . it ' s synthetic flesh . <person> blood . <person> organs . it ' s a physiological machine .
what ? you ' re don ' t even drive .
<person> . that was part of the problem .
minus specifics , it ' s hard to help .
what ?
not just the biggest golf tournament in the world ; the most democratic .
what do you mean ?
<person> , utah . <person> effective immediately . <continued_utterance> i already gave <person> my letter of resignation .
you can ' t quit , <person> .
oh , you did it yourself !
i -- oh --
can i talk to you ?
sure .
i think you don ' t know how to behave around an eight-year-old .
are you out of your mind ! ? ! <continued_utterance> now you just listen to me . i may not be the greatest mother in the world , but i ' m doing the best i know how . and he doesn ' t need you to rub his face in shit because you think it ' s good for him . he ' s going to find out the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough , and without any help from you . believe me ! <continued_utterance> i think you should get your own place . i thought , if you want , you could -- i ' ll be glad to help you out financially --
you ' re telling me you didn ' t just hear me banging on the door ?
i don ' t know what you ' re-
that ' s just how my brain works , i guess .
fascinating . <person> , why don ' t you come out with us after the lecture . there ' s a place on the <person> i always get <person> to take me .
let me tell you something , when i go and see his boss and show him this contract , he ' s out of this business . he ' ll lose his home . his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street . he ' ll probably spend some time in an institution , so god knows what will happen to his wife and kids .
why do they have to be thrown out onto the street ?
i defy any and all limits .
<person> ' t do it , ted . <person> ' t do it .
everybody likes a conspiracy . it ' s more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing . <continued_utterance> well , what are we going to do out here ? do you know your way around ? you know any country people ?
not country people . games people . the countryside ' s full of games development people , project co- ordinators , little factories - you name it .
who ? the soviets ?
meet me in one hour with that file , <person> park-
it ' s fine .
you look a little old for a student .
you ought to come hear our preacher . remember old <person> ? well , our preacher is just as strong .
next time when i feel a little better perhaps .
what do you think , <person> ?
i dunno . i don ' t know what they ' ve got .
who ' s intimidated ? i just told you i ' m gon na win the damn thing !
you don ' t got the game .
you don ' t need eagle to qualify ! you need to get used to playing smart -- no mistakes wins the open .
<person> ? i want the course record ! now gim me the lumber !
how long will you be here ?
depends on how lucky i get . i ' ll only be coming around once , maybe twice a week .
we ordered it because another game character told you to . that ' s a clue we can ' t ignore . but that ' s just basic games playing .
i want to put the game on pause . <continued_utterance> the game can be paused , can ' t it ? i mean , all games can be paused , right ?
the number of times he ' s seen the godfather .
that ' s the first good thing i ' ve heard about him .
actually , im lookin for <person> daughter , <person> . <person> and er beau took off the other day . <person> real upset about it .
<person> , that rings a bell . <person> told me somebody lookin like her was at the nothin fancy yesterday .
they ' ve got snakes ?
i ' ve heard they ' ve got snakes that ' ll outrun a horse through the grass . they got a snake that bites you . you got eleven seconds to live . no thank you . i don ' t want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy . i ' d like to go to a place where . hold it !
you black ?
no .
if you called the cops on us , pal , you ' re a dead man .
all right , what ' s that doing on the back of the bike ? <continued_utterance> you wouldn ' t by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle , would you ?
this is where he marked on the map , <person> . where he says those fossils were unearthed .
i don ' t see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . not even a sewer or a storm drain .
it ' s my job to risk my life , but not yours . i feel bad about bringing you into this , but you ' re the only one i can trust .
where were you ? on a . uh , mission ?
look at that horse ! look at the muscles he ' s got , them long legs . they ' re made for running , horses .
running away is all they have .
only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage chief <person> . and yourself .
like i said <person> , he ' s flipped his lid . i don ' t want to go to internal affairs but i ' m afraid <person> might ' ve forced just that .
just til sunday .
<person> , no . the other falls are clear on the other side . it would take you a couple nights just to get there .
my leg is falling asleep .
it ' s not falling asleep . you ' ve only been standing there for three minutes .
<person> .
i doubt it was drugs , more likely a problem with a nerve . i could recheck the arm for injuries , but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland .
no , it ' s all right .
<person> ' s been taken down . he was working for <person> .
he . he could have been watching us .
maybe we should give him some water .
about how fast was i going ?
about a hundred and ten . you wan na step out of the car , please ? <continued_utterance> is this your car ?
i don ' t know nothing about satellites . but it was heavy . <person> heavy . nobody could lift it . this gets <person> ' s attention . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> .
where ? !
she ' d aspirated vomitus into her mask .
she threw up in her mask . <person> ' s cut the bullshit . say it : she threw up
yes . but what am i running from ?
and for heaven ' s sake , practice your horsemanship .
. would i even have told you they were gone if i had anything to hide ?
but why didn ' t you kennel that dog right away ?
you ' re turning my apartment into a typewriter museum .
i ' ll stop . i ' ll try . i probably can ' t . i see one and my knees go weak . <person> , what were you starting to say ?
i see . what ' s your name , lad ?
<person> , sir .
when did you stop caring ?
about what --
shall i translate it for you ?
you speak french ?
yes ? <continued_utterance> what is it ?
thank you for seeing me .
nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere .
perhaps in appreciation for our country ' s pursuit of peace , you might offer us some , token of gratitude .
then why are you here ? y ' should be picking up a paycheck from hughes .
i ' m not watching you for him anymore .
oil , gas , cattle , farmin . <person> nobody shows off around here . <person> one of the richest in texas .
<person> guessed it , thats sure .
his problem is that he ' s like totally sheltered because you treat him like he ' s three , instead of eight , so that ' s how he behaves .
oh yeah ? and how do you think he should behave ?
hi ya , fellas . to infinity and beyond !
hey look ! it ' s <person> !
is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a --
as a matter of fact , falling down was a tactic . lulling the destroyer into a false sense of security !
there are going to be some changes <person> . you ' re going to start following some rules . and i ' m going to be there to see that you do .
<person> , right .
<person> will come .
who ? bond ? bond is dead . <continued_utterance> somehow , i find that strangely . disappointing .
and do you have kids , too ?
what ?
you okay ?
a piece of shrapnel hit me .
but there are other things . bigger things . but i realize just talking about it , they all sound petty and silly .
<person> , if you think all of this is going too fast , maybe i should move out . is that what you want , <person> ? <continued_utterance> i really care for you , but if you think it ' s best . i don ' t want to make you unhappy .
i ' m <person> . <person> ' s sick . she thought you might like me , so --
let me do the talking . you are very pretty . you may start by unzipping your dress . <continued_utterance> no no . do it slowly . <person> slowly . <continued_utterance> now slip the dress down . slowly . <continued_utterance> now slide the nylons off one by one .
<person> ? she ' s not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn ' t like to be alone .
and it doesn ' t cramp your style ?
i dreamed about <person> again . it was bizarre , yet is was so real .
it ' s your time of the month again . <continued_utterance> at least once a month . <person> ' s obsession . for twelve years you ' ve been talking about <person> .
it ' s him .
oh , happy day .
la train . at one-thirty , and we have to pack .
<person> ?
' fuck . ' ' shit . ' these are highly technical golf terms and you ' re using them on your first lesson -- this is promising .
<person> , wise ass , show me .
fourteen , <person> .

<person> me .
no . not like you . <continued_utterance> what the -- ? !
i ' m the one . i never made it work . i just . it ' s not that i don ' t love you . it ' s not that . i just never thought i ' d be thirty-six years old and i never thought . i don ' t know what i thought . what do you want , darlin ' . what do you want me to do .
i don ' t know . it doesn ' t even matter anymore . i just want you to be happy . it ' s not that i don ' t love you either . but <person> , your timing couldn ' t be worse .
<person> .
<person> , he succeeded <person> . <continued_utterance> and i ' m tired of <person> elevators . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t leave me .
brian ? did you want to see me ?
<person> . i was kind of wondering what happened to you today .
then what do they have ?
they have a president . a benjamin yahoo something .
. while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing . the other events you ' ve laid down here seem too incredible on their own , and quite frankly implausible in their connection .
what is it you find incredible ?
<person> . <person> .
nice of you to turn up .
whoever sent you knew what they were doing . you and yorgi are practically twins . two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don ' t say much .
<person> ' t judge a comic book by it ' s cover .
a teacher ' s .
oh my god .
the strait can be a very dangerous place , mr . <person> . a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london doesn ' t carry a lot of value out here . including life insurance .
i ' ll keep that in mind .
fine you want to stay here ? <continued_utterance> officers in toluca lake just found an affluent couple . completely gutted . so were the first two cops to arrive on scene .
their weapons missing ?
i ' m not talking to you anymore .
and you don ' t want to show me your face .
i don ' t know .
sit . you ' re supposed to sit .
ow ! ahh ! ow ! that really hurts .
say hello to freud for me .
if you ' re anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we didn ' t want you when you were born , so who cares if we ' re dead ? am i right ?
but we did want you . it ' s just that you don ' t always get to keep what you want . we knew you needed a real mom and dad .
i ' m sorry .
i have learned to live with death .
yeah --
or anywhere where people might see us .
<person> . i own this store .
<person> . just call me <person> . we ' ll take these books .
long time no see , huh ? you have a big book out . things are clicking , huh ?
that ' s the way i planned it .
i don ' t talk like that .
she ' s right across the room and she ' s burning a hole in my back right now , isn ' t she ?
am i going ?
you promised .
it ' s the treasure , that ' s what it is .
it better be .
<person> . i see you look at everything , study everything , ask questions . i know exactly what you ' re doing . empty your pockets .
you ' ve got to relax , baby , you ' re paranoid . <continued_utterance> hey , you ' re good .
she ' s sickly , no ?
if you or any of your friends harm her , as old as i am , i will kill you .
no , honey . this is official from the court . it ' s what <person> said . <continued_utterance> he gets paid for being <person> ' s guardian , <person> . and then he just put him in that place so he didn ' t have to worry about him . <continued_utterance> <person> belongs with us , <person> .
why ?
great . what ' s the occasion ?
just a little surprise .
i ' ll tell you something i haven ' t told my family . i ' m going back in the army .
<person> , sir ? that ' s great news !
well , hello .
we ' ve never actually met . my name ' s-
`` there is marked falling away of the muscle masses on either side of the spine in the lower lumbar region . his lower extremities present a most depressing picture . `` <continued_utterance> `` i feel after studying him that the psychological factor in his management is paramount . he has such courage and ambition . yet at the same time he is such an extraordinarily sensitive emotional mechanism .
please .
hey -- you don ' t write me for six months , i have no idea where you are --
i ' m sorry --
you dumb ass , it ' s <person> .
my name is <person> . <person>uel .
it ' s embarrassing . but you ' re all acting like you don ' t care ! well , i ' m not getting paid enough to just jerk around here . i don ' t know about you ?
i ' m not getting paid enough .
i could give a shit . i just want to this case to get a quick burial .
i ' ll bet . who made the call ?
who ' s that ?
<person> kelly , lovely woman . i think we might have had a date once . or maybe we just exchange letters .
some people grow up and change their ways .
i know your mother ain ' t still operating that house of hers .
<person> , we take goddam care of it .
we haven ' t had a decent night ' s sleep in two weeks . <person> ' s probably going to lose a $ <number> , <number> contract .
see if any of the other neighbors can verify this `peeper ' thing .
no one touch a thing `til i say . <continued_utterance> dave-
you ' ve been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel .
yes , i am confident that <person> will be taken into custody before the end of the year . but , you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force . we get a tip that he is one place , then we get there and he is already gone , having been warned by someone on our side .
a mutant species .
okay boys , smile ! <continued_utterance> all right . as you were .
get in . <continued_utterance> seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today . you ' re not planning on staying are you ?
no , sir . i ' m not going to be around long if that ' s what you ' re worried about .
yes .
i ' m sorry i turned the lights down . it didn ' t work anyway . i can turn them back up if you like --
i guess there ' s probably a story behind that .
there is , but it ' s not that interesting .
that ' s none of your goddamn business ! what kind of questions are these ?
you ' re in a lot of trouble , mrs . <person> , so i suggest you cooperate . if we want to know the most intimate details of your life , you ' d better tell us .
<person> , are you botherin ' these poor girls ?
hell , no . i was just bein ' friendly .
all these years , and no one ' s ever dared to use it as a weapon . <continued_utterance> you can ' t stop it . the bifrost will build until it rips <person> apart .
why have you done this ?
<person> low .
where the hell is it ! ?
no happy snaps .
<person> , okay . i ' ll just . be over here .
. <person> ' re <number> m in the account numbers and i ' m the invisible man . they ' re always looking for red flags , <person> ' s always getting checked by them , they never come up with anything . we ' re invulnerable on this .
<person> . i just wan na slow down <person> . no more calls for awhile , no lunches . we suspend our business , alright .
how ' d i do that ?
you ain ' t thinking about shanking , you ain ' t thinking about the doctor lady , you ain ' t thinking period . you just lookin ' like a fool and hittin ' it pure -- your natural state .
what ?
it was the police . they have <person> .
you okay , honey ?
that womans laugh creeps me out . i heard somethin like that . somewhere before . <person> like the wicked witch .
listen , russell , let ' s grow up . it ' s very easy to fall in love with the underdog , eh ? but there ' s an upside and downside to this thing -- just wanta remind you . this stuff about a `` revolution of poets '' is crap .
but it ' s great p . r . so what ' s the upside ?
then shoot him already .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> what do we do now ?
i ' m on a special phone , may i speak freely ?
you may speak .
laser .
<person> , laser .
who the fuck is he ?
-- a fucking cop . <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> police .
well . this is . surprising . does <person> . ?
i think <person> would find this a little more than surprising .
listen to me , a bomb is planted somewhere in the hollywood bowl !
i ' m sorry , sir , i don ' t have the authorization to do that .
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat .
objection , we ' ve .
you didn ' t see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . but i did . you kind of liked it , didn ' t you ? that thrill of going over the edge again . of taking out an innocent bystander or two , as long as you got the target .
go to hell .
he ' s still a little warm . <continued_utterance> yuck . <continued_utterance> that ' s a . big trunk . it fits a tuba , a <continued_utterance> whose tuba is that anyway ?
<person> ' s .
<person> has forbidden your return . <continued_utterance> this is goodbye , brother . i ' m so sorry .
no , i ' m sorry . <person> . thank you for coming here .
but i ' m telling you , my father put away every penny he ever earned . they owned that house outright . why would he have a mortgage ?
my guess is because he let people pay him in beans and eggs or whatever they had , instead of money .
you should have killed me when you had the chance . but you couldn ' t . not me . a woman you ' ve loved .
you meant . nothing . to me . <continued_utterance> one . last . screw ?
he died of dehydration . thirst .
but that doesn ' t make sense . that takes a couple of days , doesn ' t it ?
<person> <person> informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter , but that you ' re not even mentally-handicapped , and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body .
that rat-fink-fuck !
<person> can not transform you . i ' ve protected this camp with a spell .
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress , <person> ?
i admire your courage , young man . you might have made a fine <person> after all . <continued_utterance> but we ' ll never know , will we ? <continued_utterance> find the three <person>s and kill them .
they ' ll be dead by dawn .
we ' re not canceling .
i know .
you might be new but you seem to know what you ' re doing .
i , ah . i ' ve been trained by the very best .
i ' m so sick of that shit ! and when he isn ' t singing , he ' s watching t . v . and don ' t say you don ' t ' cause when i come home i always put my hand on top of it to see if it ' s warm , and it always is . this is the news , kid -- i ' m wise to you .
oh , big , big deal , who cares , and as long as we ' re passing out news here , i don ' t want to do my paper route anymore .
only when i ' m working . <continued_utterance> <person> shit . are you serious ?
as a heart attack .
we ' ll be quiet . <person> and quiet .
i don ' t want to be either .
<person> . i ' m coming . <person> down ! <continued_utterance> why ' s that ?
' <person> i love you . inching closer .

<person> ! ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! !
he didn ' t want anyone to know . he kept it out of the papers . he said a third wife was bad for his image . you ' ve got to protect me !
go to my hotel room . i ' ll be there in twenty minutes .
not yet . i don ' t want to freak her out .
<person> call . so we just need a new strategy , that ' s all . what about that judge that ' s always throwing work your way ? can ' t she help you out ?
how did ya know ?
you mean to make up my mind to marry her ?
i know , i know . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m sorry i got so mad before . i just don ' t want him , you know -- terrified of `` telling , '' if there ' s --

i don ' t want courage . i don ' t want to be a warrior . all i ' ve ever wanted was to do magic , real magic , like you !

<person> , this is crazy .
oh it ' s just a rental . i ' m moving to the east side soon . i ' ve got a couple of deals brewing with <person> . but that ' s just conversation . what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . friday . <person> . <person> .

so what was it about ? your book . what was the story ?
i said , you ' re not really here . neither am i . we ' re both in the memory studio -- in the offices of <person> , <person> . on earth .
are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some . artificially injected fantasy ?
must be a compartment .
i feel air . probably opens up outside somewhere . that ' s where the light comes from . <person> ' t see it with the lanternon .
what are you doing ?
what are you talking about ?
what do you mean it doesn ' t change anything ? have a heart , brendan .
you listen to me . you take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road . run it out on someone who doesn ' t know you like i do .
and neither will i .
oh , alright . you know , i liked <person> desmond . he had his own m . o . <continued_utterance> i cracked the whiteman case with this .
we kidnapped <person> out of panama . is that covered in your constitution ?
<person> is a criminal .
i didn ' t lie to you --
you did too --
i was good . i mean , even better than usual .

you queered the fed ' s <person> by killing that boxer and they already had a hard-on for the lapd- <person> sent you down here as damaged goods . think about it . everybody sees what ' s coming . now close this quick .
what do you want ?
i ' m looking for my daughter , <person> . she comes here .
-so you show-up <person> . co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can . <person> can you turn lemons to lemonade .
no cop will testify against other cops . this is why <person> has suddenly disappeared .
you were in the room . it was your purview . it was your job to make sure bissel wasn ' t fucking us over and you didn ' t do it . you ' ve got the most important job in the world right now . you ' re the smartest guy the president has . besides me .
anybody ever tell you you ' re an egomaniac and a prick , <person> ' <person> ?
what ' s that ?
well . if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school . in the long run you ' d save them thousands of dollars . i mean look at the cost of dental bills . i bet i could have put my kids through college with what i ' ve spent on fillings .
the inside man ?
is maybe . the inside woman .
we ' re going to make your arms function as your legs .
how is that possible ?
oh , my god , i said fuck to a rabbi . i ' m sorry .

<person> ' t do it .
<person> . ?
my friend and i are guests . we ' ve come down for the snow . where are you keeping it ?

i am mad at you ! and at landon ! and the universe ! and god ! i don ' t even know where to put all my anger .
you enjoy them all year round . we won ' t get in your way , will we ?
as long as your friend doesn ' t try to take my sister for a sleigh ride .
right . ok . so i ' ll go get <person> .
how ' s he doing ?
i ' m making you uncomfortable . baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that doesn ' t bother you . but me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull .
yes . yes . that ' s exactly it . yes .
from what i understand , the u . s . open is the most difficult golf tournament in the world played under the most difficult circumstances with the greatest players -- winning it means controlling yourself , managing your emotions , staying cool , not getting in a pissing contest with your caddie who , incidentally , quit .
he always quits , he always comes back .
nerve boards ?
we use the nervous systems of specially-bred insects to create the electronic circuits on our motherboards . <continued_utterance> <person> has it .
nah . <person> called me . he ' s starting up a new fund out here in may so i ' m gon na wait for that .
that guy ' s starting another fund ?
she is the presumed guardian , mr flaherty .
i understand that .
i guess it must .
what do you do anyway ?
general , the joint chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the soviets . you have signalled an escalation which i had no wish to signal , and which i did not approve .
lemay . he ' s history .

according to jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . they must be buried together or their souls won ' t rest in peace .

he shut down your paper ! you ' re stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and pta brunches !
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you .

i give you the body of <person> , head of lapd ' s <person> . proof of a <number> -year criminal collusion between his department and <person> and my testimony to link the dots . then i leave la for good .
what happened to <person> ?
can i say something here ? <person> asked me to come and talk to you , because it ' s her opinion that you ' re not gon na find what you ' re looking for the way you ' re looking for it --
how would she know ?
of course you ' re taking good care of her -- we know what it ' s like , don ' t cry , she looks great .
it ' s just ' cause i haven ' t slept in four nights -- she must be teething or something , i don ' t know but i can ' t manage .
<person> . <continued_utterance> hey , you sure we should do this ?
why not ? whether he ' s here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day . unless you want him hanging out here ?
is that what you ' d like me to do ?
go home , <person> . it ' s late .
you must learn magic .
that ' s all i ever wanted !
one idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately <number> million dollars .
you can ' t keep bringing up starbucks . that was your only real hit in like <number> tries .
it ' s always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field . tell me , why do you think <person> went to new york ?
she has a job in the carousel .
soy un periodista .
mr . price . you must accept our deepest apologies for the misunderstanding . <person> saw you taking photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub -- our young officers get carried away . they ' re always looking for traitors .
that ' s true . <person> , maybe i am gay .
<person> ' t be retarded . we were doing research for our girlfriends .
that ' s thirty-three bucks . can you believe that . ?
oh , yeah . your broad from last night .
moving the line . <person> of genius .
<person>f course it is . but the president needs to realize we ' re going to have to stop a ship eventually .
you know i am .
<person> . you sat in front . i saw you there .
undersheriff <person> and i have talked on the phone . <person> work .
sure you don ' t want us to post some backup units ?
you didn ' t have to fly back -- from -- wherever , for me .
i ' m here to congratulate my friends and their children . i ' m leaving again tonight .
that ' s what i heard .
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this . and no one had a machine like this .
all set . <continued_utterance> to us . <continued_utterance> now go easy on me , <person> . i ' m just a beginner .
<person> takes bishop at <person> four -- <person> take pawn at <person> two -- <person> takes <person> at <person> one -- checkmate .
you ' re getting gold , and you ' re going to blow it on wheels ?
what are you going to do with your <continued_utterance> oh , that ' s fun .
in the passenger car ?
yes . where are the rest of the passengers ?
do you have the `` shoe '' books ?
the `` shoe '' books ? who ' s the author ?
this body is in your possession ?
and it ' s what you need to burn <person> to the ground . but if those files and his body were to be given to <person> and the feds , with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop . well . the word `cataclysmic ' comes to mind .
forget it , man . it ' s not worth it .
she ' s got us . now , listen , the plan is : we have done our last job in perfection .
is <person> lying again ? they did kill him , didn ' t they ?
everybody smile .
i ' m just getting used to ya , <person> .
<person> ' s face it , we ' re not exactly setting the world on fire .
<person> .
<person> , thanks a lot , <person> -- believe them instead of me .
well , good . i ' d feel awful if it hadn ' t worked out . <continued_utterance> i told <person> ' d marry him . in two weeks . i don ' t know what else to do . i mean , he ' s been helping me with the rent since <person> left . and you need a father . i think it ' s the best thing all the way around -- what d ' you think ? there is a pause as they look at each other .
i think it ' s the best thing .
you do everything <person> says ?
go to hell .
welcome to <person> . have a look at our proposal . please follow me .
you can wait out here .
i can see that .
i didn ' t ask for an extra bed . <continued_utterance> are you all right with the sofa ? if you like , i can have them bring one up ?
do your friend a favor , <person> , keep him quiet . mcmanus you ' re clean , <person> ? say it ain ' t so . was it you that hit that truck ?
forget him . it ' s not important . i was trying to make a point .
well maybe your wife .
she isn ' t here .
a thing like that should never be allowed to happen again .
i couldn ' t agree with you more .
you turned <person> over on his face . but the coyotes must ' ve turned him back over , man , cuz his spirit is out . it ' s out , and it knows .
what do you know about spirits ? you ain ' t no in ' dn .
i ' ve always been a collector at heart . when i see something i want , i have to have it .
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
the guidance counselor at blue bay .
we understand your feelings , ms . <person> . but please , we ' d like some time with <person> . we ' d like to take her statement alone .
just relax .
how ' m i gon na relax standing on a mine ! ?
are you crazy , <person> ?
you heard <person> say `` sam . `` that was <person> on the phone . and you saw the girls .
more ?
<person> and <person> were not terribly prudent in terms of providing for the possibility of the unforeseen .
tell him i ' m trying to find the man who murdered <person> . ask him if he knows where he is . <continued_utterance> what did he say ?
he said he doesn ' t know .
what are you looking at ?
telephone poles . they must have a junction box or something to test the lines . there ! see that one ?
how ' d it go with the doctor lady , boss ?
if she was a par three , i ' d ' a made a nine .
remember how we were ?
not like this . we were never like this . i want to go over there . after dinner , we can --
then go through the list . get me <person> .
all i ' m saying is if you need somebody to help you , i ' m happy to keep your boy warm for you .
<person> ' t you say your mom went to catholic school ?
when we fall , we fall hard .
its none of my business , but when are you and <person> gon na tie the knot ? i always wondered why you never did .
not for lack of love , i can tell ya that .
. to get her heartbeat back . ?
we ' ve touched on this , his own witness has said .
you ' re right on the money , <person> .
she must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long .
<person> , lionel ?
i can ' t . i ' m working for the federal government .
the bitch shot me , is what happened . <continued_utterance> hey , what did you want me to do , die ?
well , shit , you ' re the cop , they don ' t teach you to disarm people , shoot them in the leg or something ? you weren ' t supposed to kill her for <person> ' s sake .
<person> ' t that bring back memories ? remember those terrible , trying days in italy . when we had to beat the women off with chocolate bars ?
and wasn ' t it awful the way they kept bothering us for american cigarettes ? why , i must have taught fifty girls how to smoke .
you calling me a murderer ?
did i say that ?
<person> , i want a complete workup on her . do we know where she is ?
uh huh . <person> here in river city .
i ask for a lot of ' em . <person> is it ?
dean <person> ' s , sir .
is that one of the <number> steps ? or does a guy like you get <number> ?
just the <number> .
know what you mean , <person> . <person> is a tough thing to come by these days . just trust in the lord .
<person> .
what ' s the matter with you ?
nothing . i ' m just tired .
gates , myrhvold , <person> . i sell to all those guys . why ? because the technology to intrude has reached the masses . your competitor , your ex-spouse , adversaries , stalkers , they ' re at the local electronics store right now , and they ' re gon na be intruding on you not only through your telephone , but your fax , cell phone , pager , cable tv , <person> , windows , walls , air conditioning ventilation , modem , and internet connection . <continued_utterance> nobody has these babies , no way , not the shiznit .
i want to intercept cell phone calls , digital and analog . and locate the source of the call . i need databasing capability , to cross-reference calls and numbers .
i had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute .
uh-huh .
because i never do .
that ' s why we got adjusters .
-- those are very serious allegations , <person> --
yes . i know .
i told her that i have no idea what <person> was talking about in that letter .
did she believe you ?
excellent .
i see you ' re in your natural element , <person> : a room filled with lethal power . . with a toxic core at its center .
you ' re right . it ' s not a joke . <person> , i know a little about the amish . i know this has to be an ordeal for you ; and i ' m really sorry you an <person> got involved . <continued_utterance> what was that ?
he wants to know who you are . your name . i told him we don ' t need to know anything about you .
as queen , my mind touches on many subjects .
do your knees feel as weak as water ?
maybe we should just .
<person> .
it ' s a stakeout suit . it ' s got food , water , recording gear , anything you need for covert spying . it ' s all- weather , fire retardant , and if you give this buckle a sharp pull , the whole outfit deploys into a parachute .
you ' re joking , right ?
how can you not have a cell ?
how ' re you doing ? you all right ?
<person> , i had to go slummin ' . <person> , a friend of mine ' s bein ' framed .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
the same interest as yours <person> . <person> . i thought it ' d be a good investment for my kid .
no . this time i ' m in for the long term . this is not a liquidation , <person> . i ' m going to turn it around . you ' re getting a free ride on my tail , mate , and with the dollars you ' re costing me to buy back the stock , i could modernize the plant . i ' m not the only one who pays here <person> . we ' re talking about lives and jobs ; three and four generations of steel workers .
you have dangerous coworkers , dr .
<person> , not dangerous . he was distraught when he found out that you ' d taken all of our research . it was years of his life , gone ! he got depressed , started drinking , and . well , you know the rest .
<person> , okay , i ' m sure that i just . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
restaurant . let them know we ' re running late .
<person> ' you swear that the evidence you are about to give will be the truth , the .
the bailiff swearing in kathy .
hey babe . how was work ? <continued_utterance> oh my god . what happened ? you said it was going to be a slow night .
i ' m not bouncing at a club .
my employer wishes to remain anonymous .
<person> ' t jerk me off . we all know what this is . you don ' t work with me if i work with you without knowing who i ' m working for . now let ' s cut the shit . who ' s the man ?
i snuck back to my car , trying to convince myself it never happened . and when i woke up in the hospital . somehow it hadn ' t . <person> now .
it was last year . we were having troubles .
<person> <person> lived at the canyon trailer park for a month . we ' ll check that . and worked as a waitress at hap ' s <person> . worked the night shift . <person> place for dinner when we ' re through here , <person> . no one came to claim the body and no known next of kin . as <person> is doing this , <person> takes out his special machine .
solved the whiteman case with this .
<person> ' s scenario is unacceptable . and he has more experience than anyone .
there is no expert on this subject , no wise old man .
<person> . i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend . think that might be possible ?
i don ' t know . i ' m sort of at a critical . . . juncture .
come over the top a little .
yeah . well , as <person> once said -- ' sex and golf are the only two things you can be bad at and still enjoy . '
i guess .
i ' m saying it ' s luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he ' s paid the dues , he ' s ready , does all the market research , picks his shot -- `` <person> . ``
that ' s the face of my kaiser and he does not look pleased with me . the horse is yours .
<person> quiet , hasn ' t it ?
i do trust you , <person> . like i aint never trusted nobody before .
well be alright , peanut , long as weve got room to move .
and who might that be ? <person> ? <person> ?
<person> , wow . i was afraid you left . i was afraid i ' d never see you again .
fine -- give me proof .
su hija , su hija ! your daughter from los angeles .
you haven ' t been here very long .
long enough , lets face it , you were right . everybody was right .
maybe you should move back into the city ? get a new job . shake it up a bit .
nah . <person> called me . he ' s starting up a new fund out here in may so i ' m gon na wait for that .
it ' s certainly . dramatic .
especially in this light . this is the only light they had then , so i like to study it this way . i love this place . i love all ruins .
we have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . under the authority vested in me by the president , i ' m giving you temporary reassignment .
what ' s the assignment ?
god . why is this happening to us ?
i can feel your stomach rumbling .
through the forehead ?
yes .
<person> and <person> don ' t think so .
<person> ' s happy because he wants to be state attorney general and his most likely opponent will be welles <person> . <person> ' s happy because <person> , who ' s leading their city council race , is endorsed by <person> . thus , they ' re not seeing the larger play . <person> ' s new target will likely be the lapd itself .
oh , <person> .
i hope you wasn ' t pettin ' him none , was you ?
i came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england .
a spy . ?
you have to excuse <person> : she thinks she ' s on a ' seduce and destroy ' mission through life . . but she won ' t kill us .
no ?
well . i ' d like to think that love is a question of destiny , not chance .
for a moment there you just reminded me of somebody . <continued_utterance> he had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he ' d completely avoided the truth . his entire life was wrapped up in deception . he told so many lies , i wouldn ' t believe him even if he finally did tell the truth .
can i ask you something ?
you mean there ' s something you haven ' t asked me ?
-chapter <number> : don ' t write shit down . chapter <number> : or other cops might kill you .
so you think <person> will come after you for the sanderline thing ? he seems like a real hard charger .
why else would they approach us in this way ? it ' s deniable . the soviets have done nothing but lie to us . this could be more of the same .
that may be why <person> ' s introducing this guy . we ' ve been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .
we can make a dimpled smile out of a frown --
can you even dye my eyes to match my gown ?
it ' s lovely mom .
<person>by , please !
<person> , so . i ' m gon na wait and see what happens there . but that sounds great , yeah .
<person> . so is that a yes or a no ?
to die by a man who can ' t even grasp what he ' s caught up in .
<person> isn ' t so hard to fathom . what ' s clever is getting someone else to pay for it .
<person> , have you ever seen my hands so steady ? have you ?
i ' m going inside .
i ' m trembling with excitement .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .
i saw their car last night in the parking lot at base . so they didn ' t leave , `` just before dusk . ``
well , i was down at base this morning . car ' s gone now .
tails . i stay .
but . ? <continued_utterance> at least take my pistol . <continued_utterance> i ' ll never forget you .
oh . so . is -- is your friend crabtree -- is he -- gay ?
most of the time he is , <person> . some of the time he isn ' t . now what do we have here ? <continued_utterance> looks like . our old friend mr . <person> . that should take the pinch out of my ankle . have one .
hmmm . i suppose this is a step above that profession . ten seconds . are you leaving ?
no .
you should always work with a spotter .
heandiacute ; s busy right now .
no , i ' ve learned my lesson . <person> na play it safe , smart , conservative . fairways and greens . hand me the two iron .
you sure ?
<person> ' t cross <person> . he ' ll crush you . you ' ve worked hard to get where you are . if <person> doesn ' t buy <person> someone else will ; and who ' s to say they won ' t do the same thing .
at least i wouldn ' t be pulling the trigger .
hmm ?
maybe she ' ll change her mind . women do . she might give you a second chance .
goddamnit , <person> . this is our butts . so your life is in the toilet . so your wife is banging a used car salesman . sure it ' s humiliating . but be a man here --
you tell on me , i tell on you .
oh , actually it was . then why ' d you call it off ?
who says i ' m the one that called it off ?
governments are always wrong , eh ?
this time they ' re right . who are you ?
or what ?
the boy goes away .
hi ?
<person> ' t you recognize me ?
<person> .
it means setting small , reasonable goals for yourself . one day at a time , one tiny step at a time -- do- able , accomplishable goals .
you do .
oh my god . its <person> . <person> down ! . get goin !
when . when will she be back ?
i don ' t know .
i don ' t know what to say .
i ' m not the police . i don ' t care about experimentation . she ' s a kid .
huh ? if . if we . we ' re not ?
if we ' re not , then you just killed someone real . a real person .
mr . <person> , i don ' t think i can . go on .
. finish out the game , <person> , push yourself . <continued_utterance> the public is out there throwing darts at a board , sport . i don ' t throw darts at a board . i only bet sure things . <person> ' s `` the art of war . `` ' every battle is won before it is ever fought . ' think about it .
youre excitin me , honey . whatd she do ?
her face was half-pushed into the pillow , and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said , i wont suck you . <person> ask me to suck you .
i ' ve seen this thirty times .
we did a story on this guy . he owns half of arizona .
eighty-three . well , you humble now .
eleven bogeys and seven pars . i didn ' t make a three . i didn ' t make one goddam three all day .
and if no one comes to get them by night-time , then they belong to me .
<person> . <person> at me . you can not ride .
dad , it takes time . you got ta build a customer list . i ' m doing it . i could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline .
i don ' t get it , you get a scholarship to nyu , you get <number> , <number> the first year , and <number> last year , where the hell is it ?
my own business . thanks for the light . <person> ?
next round ' s on me .
<person> ' t show up for work last night . called a friend of hers , a waitress that works here too , said she was at bido lito ' s in hollywood . said she was `hiding out . '
she actually said `hiding out ? '
is it over ?
no .
<person> , alright . <person> calm . you opened this door . there ' s got to be a way that you can close it .
like what ?
it was <person> ' s idea .
what can i get you ?
if we don ' t get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house . we haven ' t had a guest for three weeks .
what are you looking for ?
if only .
please . i have to go .
boyd you idiot , the shit ' s coming down !
what does that mean ?
sit down here .
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ?
may i ask you something ? <continued_utterance> how ' d you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as <person> ?
it wasn ' t hard .
what ' s real to you ? wall street ? capital hill ? now they are myths .
i can ' t be dicking around here . that ' s all i ' m saying . i don ' t carry crystals , i don ' t wan na come back in another life . i just wan na do my job , and do it right , and get the fuck outta here .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
really ? !
yeah . but it ' s still going to be `` neil '' .
i think we just need to get wasted .
i wan na live at the beach someday .
i need a ticket .
where to ?
<person> , <person> . little accident . <continued_utterance> yo voy a pagar la taza .
did you see that ? the first time she brings a man in here , and he ' s a lunatic !
the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
<person> , but we made that deal while <person> was still alive . he ' s gone . time for a new deal .
thank you .
i ' ve written the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the phone . zip me up , will you please ? if we aren ' t home in two hours , it means we ' ve decided to go on to a movie and won ' t be back until after midnight . is that all right ?
i know she ' s in there . let me talk to her .
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about . go away !
you ' ve got no chance , lad . he ' ll not turn over half an acre . give it up now . you ' ve done well . you ' ve tried hard . you ' re more of a man than your father .
come on now , mr . lyons , that ' s a bit rough , isn ' t it ?
i don ' t know . he could have told someone . he could have , like in the event of his death , somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried .
the only proof is those bodies .
i was just thinking about where i ' m gon na stay . i lost the house . it ' s like waking up from a goddamn nightmare .
you ' ll get over it . we ' ve got a knockdown , airtight , motherfucker of a lawsuit against <person> .
then somebody ' d better deny it publicly .
<person> , <person> ' <person> , you ' re the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution .

<person> , we promised never to talk about this . <continued_utterance> what are we supposed to do ? leave town ? take the kids and lock ourselves up somewhere ? come on . <person> ' s get a good night ' s sleep , and in the morning we can rethink this whole thing .
nothing has to be rethought . and i ' m not about to fall asleep .
you fucked me , man ? why would you do that ?
what do you mean ' why ' ?
i can ' t . it ' s a facial shield . it ' s an antiseptic prosthesis to stop infections . these fucking doctors .

. i ' m sure you do .
what did you put on it ?
it ' s healing now .
<person> , ladies , thanks for all the advice . but i think i ' ll just take one of each . to be on the safe side .
<person> ' t forget -- if the baby ' s less than three months old , you have to be sure to sterilize the bottles .
mr . <person> , i ' ve charted the growth of new office space in the city , and i think you ' re in the right business at the right time .
thank you for telling me what i already know .
man , ever since i let her dump my ass she just can ' t resist kicking me in it .
maybe you should treat her more like a lady .
we will accept your most gracious offer .
run back home , little princess .
were you in nam ?
airborne . that ' s where they used to get us agents from . now we get ' em from carnegie-melon , ivy league . accountants and computer whiz-kids . yuppies with guns . that ' s scary shit .
i wish <person> was here . i ain ' t cut out to do this . i ' m a spectator by nature . an observer .
<person> up and hand me the big dog .
but the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video , which is even more stunning than the <person> video . let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven ' t seen it , and i don ' t know anyone who hasn ' t , but <person> riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle , saving lives in the process , and then walked away without claiming a medal . he ripped the door off a tank !
<person> riordan is a genuine war hero , i ' m not taking anything away from the guy . he ' s a very , very tough guy , <person> , but the tank don ' t hit back . we ' ve seen youtube sensations fail on the big stage before .
there are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the <person> . i have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking .
i understand .
you ' re lying .
no . though i have no way to prove otherwise . the virus is extraterrestrial . we know very little about it , except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet .
and you must be <person> holiday .
that ' s the rumor .
thank you for telling me what i already know .
i ' m impressed with your work and i could use a tax break . this is a growing business . are you interested in some working capital and a partner ?
that ' s why we got adjusters .
you got a problem with me going ?

it was nip and tuck .
they welcomed your company , franklin .
<person> ' t patronize me .

come on down , guys . it ' s time for games ! we ' ve got prizes !
-- and yet , they might only be here because you wanted them to be . you are their god . and not only that , you could make them obey you . or even destroy you .
what i ' d like them to do is shut up ! especially you ! silence . <person> opens his eyes . they ' re all staring at him . casually waiting for orders .
-- if they want someone to blame , they can blame me . <person> doesn ' t deserve this .
she ' s in there right now saying the same thing about you .
and you believe the board , the seven dwarves , put you here to take control of your company .
what do you care ?
you can ' t just propose to me out of nowhere . you think that ' s going to solve our problems ? i ' m sorry , x . it was a kick for a while , but it ' s over . you ' re just not going anywhere .
you ' re not exactly `` going anywhere '' yourself .
then what ?
mcmanus was furious . he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . that night we got the call .
<person> thinks she was murdered .
i don ' t know what to say .

' who knows his own strength is twice armed . '
it ' s always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field . tell me , why do you think <person> went to new york ?

but i survive ! i survive with my arm and my face reconstructed . and what ' s worse i couldn ' t wake up .
how was your house after the party ?
you have a problem , <person> . my wife is right . somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it .
are you finished ?
<person> --
it may be extraterrestrial .

as the town ' s most popular playboy , the president felt my presence would be sorely missed . so in the interests of national security .
<person> the car .
<person> ! <person> , you shot him .
<person> was here , but he left . he only dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms .
but i gave <person> two already .

a joker to the end .
<person> like our goose is cooked , our hash is slung , our fait is accompli .
you heard right .
you really are one dumb asshole .
oh , no .
he gave you an infected bioport so that my pod would die and so would my game-system .
yup . and now i ' m gon na change hers .
but wait . why did you install a bad port into me ?
you know theres somethin i aint never told you about , sailor , and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things to happen . when i was almost sixteen i got pregnant .
<person> been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time . what did you do , your mama find out ?
they ' re studying the buildings . trying to figure them out .
<person> , they ' re confused . they can feel our vibrations , but they can ' t find us .
nice to have you back with us , mr . <person> .
nice to be back . i ' m flattered you remember me .
if i had it all to do over , i ' d still hit that shot .
the look comes over your face , you would bury yourself alive to prove you can handle a shovel . <person> looks over at <person> for signs of an implied pejorative . but <person> ' s just washing and scooping balls . and looking badly in need of perspective .
you want anything special for dinner ?
no , thelma , i don ' t give a shit what we have for dinner . i may not even make it home for dinner . you know how fridays are .
<person> ? is that you ?
i am <person> twisp . i am alive . i am a breathing organism .
depends on the state .
<person> .

yeah ? <person> stares hard at the man in front of him .
we ' ve had some problems with drug selling in this stadium . would you mind if i checked the pockets of your sweatshirt ?
<person> . it wouldn ' t really be .
<person> ? can ' t we just skirt the issue ?
that you have to stay .
yes . - i am sorry because i could tell so much to the people of my own time . i could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them . they could learn from it . or would they ?
no !
well , could i please --
you do ? what else you do ?
i ' m a national merit finalist . i ' m on the hi-q team and the math team . i ' m in the spanish club . i ' m a thespian . i ' m vice-president of my class . i ' m on the volleyball team .
time for you to die .
the reactor is secured . <continued_utterance> this is the end .
so what about you <person> anyway ?
if i had to explain it you <person> ' t understand . just say we ' re brothers to the bone .
it ' s on the boat . he ' s holding a press conference tomorrow . <continued_utterance> i ' m so sorry , <person> . i promise , i ' ll never leave you again .
<person> .
<person> christ !
<person> , <person> , you owe me sixteen plus from the race , and you ' re in for over two grand on the books , so i tell you what . i ' ll wipe the slate clean . <continued_utterance> here ' s a thou until you get yourself set up . i can do no better than that .
he wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .
and you agreed ?
but why all of this ?
we had to watchdog you . make sure the erasure took . a wife seemed like a good idea .
dr . <person> , please don ' t be angry . it ' s <person> . i know i shouldn ' t call this way but --
<person> , listen to me . the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust . when you call me against my wishes or pretend to be my sister , i can ' t trust you any more .
oh man , how ' d that feel , <person> ? we ' ll just call you `` pancake '' !
<person> up , chewbaka .
call him a sissy .
why ?
now you sound like <person> and <person> .
there is something in their common sense attitude to life . <person> , i speak to you as a friend . more , as a brother . if that machine can do what you say it can . destroy it . destroy it , <person> , before it destroys you .
<person> , he succeeded <person> . <continued_utterance> and i ' m tired of <person> elevators . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t leave me .
i already have .
i know you ' re bored in this assignment , but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now .
how ' s that ?
i don ' t know , <person> .
and where are they going with it ?
<person> , i got ta start makin ' money .
oh , all right .
as for you , my galvanized friend , you want a heart ! you don ' t know how lucky you are not to have one . hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable . i could have been a world figure , a power among men , a - a successful wizard , had i not been obstructed by a heart .
but i still want one .
problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you ' re never happy ' cause somebody ' s always trying to take it away from you . <person> ' s one giant pain in the ass y ' ask me . thanks .
. <person> , you should ' ve been a ceo .
you ' ve got no business in the ring with those animals .

<person> ' t i , norman ? you kept the fucking necklace . of a woman you killed !
i did not ! i did not kill anyone . <person> . <person> , listen to me . i walked in and she was lying there dead . i swear to you . on my life ! she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me ! to destroy us ! if i hadn ' t stopped by here before school , the painters would have --
i love you .
one move , and you really will be a woman . <continued_utterance> you ' re a fool . now put her back .

we should make our move now .
mid-fight ? look at the crowd : you wan na be at the center of a riot ?
could you identify ' em , if ya saw ' em again ?
<person> , i ' ve told you about twenty times , yes , i could identify ' em , but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this .
you mean in scottsville ?
yes .
i have a gift for you . something that belonged to my father . he would have wanted you to have it .
perhaps this isn ' t the time .
mr . <person> , got a sure thing . <person> .
no such thing <person> - ' cept death and taxes . not a good company anymore , no fundamentals . what ' s going on <person> ? do you know something ? remember there ' re no short cuts son , quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets . you ' re part of something here , <person> . the money you make for people creates science and research jobs .
you ' re young , strong . it ' s gon na be easy for you . not like me .
wh-what . ?
you live in the neighborhood ?
uh-huh . my nephew ' s going to be staying with us in a few months , so i stopped by .
it ' s no arsonist ' s <person> , but i guess you know that . it ' s a young man ' s book . it got me remembering how it felt to be young .
maybe i should read it .
what ' s a big deal ?
ask your daddy , sweetie . maybe he ' ll tell you .
come join us .
you fight like a musketeer . <person> ' s see if you can drink like one .
it ' s just new drapes and curtain rods . if i had known it was going to be so heavy i would have had them delivered up to the house . <continued_utterance> i just got tired of looking at the old drapes . my mother made them . had them long as i can remember . you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it ? bobby yes , i have . <continued_utterance> ' course they cost a little more than i should really be spending . but , damn it , i don ' t hardly ever do anything nice for myself . i deserve nice things . bobby i . can ' t . argue . <continued_utterance> this is it . <continued_utterance> thank you , <person> .
you ' re welcome , <person> .
yes . i ' m sure he ' s hoping you ' ll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .
do you really think so ?
you know , sometimes i wish i could be like <person> and not go home . i ' d like to just bounce around for awhile , do a little traveling .
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to ? it ' s clear healy forgot about that one .
see this ? can you believe it ? two inch screen .
. i can ' t even see it .
you talk to <person> about this ?
all the rangers are on the lookout .
yes , i am , mother ! those new linen pants you got me from egypt make my ass look just huge .
well , you can ' t keep starving yourself .
why don ' t you go and try some of that on ?
okay .
<person> , at night i ' m in charge .
will you quit fighting all the time ? she just fell asleep , for <person> .
i never heard of him .
his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians . most likely the same hungarians that <person> all but wiped out back in turkey . the money wasn ' t there for dope . the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger <person> for them .
musketeers . <continued_utterance> by joint edict of his majesty king <person> and his eminence cardinal <person> , the musketeers are officially disbanded . in preparation for the coming war with england , your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the infantry . you will be contacted and told where to report . until that time , you are instructed to return to your homes .
and who will protect the king ?
uh-huh . where was he ?
out getting coffee .
you ' ve made a considerably wise decision .
my kid ' s gon na go berserk .
you must overcome your fears and regain control . <person> hold of your life again . it ' s as easy as holding that glass . what if i told you that you can take control of all of this . everything . even me .
<person> . i ' m straight , okay ?
what do they want a virgin for ?
to throw into the fire .
rather an obvious question under the circumstances , don ' t you <person> ? a better one might be how do you feel ?
hurts . hurts pretty bad .
what ' s <continued_utterance> toons aren ' t given imperfections .
no ? i guess we ' re not counting lying , stealing and murder .
who did it ?
friend of mine , owns a club . <person> . you ' d know him if you saw him . his brother was in your class . <person> .
you heard about it ? ! i was lucky .
did anyone ever die next to you in combat ?
then whose ? <continued_utterance> after the lightning strike , we tried to go aloft to drop sail . we ' d done it a thousand times . we didn ' t have to wait for an order . but <person> called us down .
if the foremast had taken a strike , everyone in the rigging would ' ve been fried . what would you have done ?
really ? and what game did you want to play ? you carry my box for me , and i fall into bed with you ?
i think i can find my own way back to into town .
wait a minute , you thinkin ' of getting in bed with the cowboys ?
business is business . <person> ' t have to love ' em to work with ' em . not if there ' s money in it .
no big deal . just your average day in the nhl .
how long have you known ?
that stuff ' s a waste of money .
i ' m sure there are excesses and repetitions here , but i believe in the gathering of knowledge and i figured , well , there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices -- and that you ' d help me sort through it . <continued_utterance> i have dozens of golf videotapes , too . and a golf watch .
it has to be done .
we have to get going .
all right then . it ' s refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment . will you have friends or family saying words -- singing or anything ?
are we supposed to ?
-<person> did you load that gun ? <person> nods , `` yes . `` crying harder now . jeremy -you won ' t get hurt . <continued_utterance> -<person> was wrong .
-sometimes when people are sick or hurt for a long time , like <person> , they ' re mind gets hurt too . <continued_utterance> -they start to think things that aren ' t true . he hold me what he thought about your father . it isn ' t true . jeremy -i ' ll show you .
well once . <person> .
<person> again .
my dear , if there ' s one thing the demise of <person> twisp has taught me , it ' s that self worth comes from within .
would you like to stay the night , <person> ? we can reminisce of our departed .
you ' re really going to commit suicide for her ? <person> responds , into the microphone .
in case you ' ve forgotten . i ' m dead already .
<person> never tasted nuthin ' like that ?
fifty bucks . <continued_utterance> i ' ll sell you the jar for fifty bucks .
i can whack people . i ' m hell at whacking .
whacking is not of much use on a farm .
you ' re mocking me , aren ' t you ?
oh , no , no , no . <person> , look ! an alien !
<person> again , that ' s government property . you have to sign for everything . i ' ve got one more that wasn ' t on your list .
from the beastie boys collection ?
well -- maybe it would ' ve been better if you had . <continued_utterance> i mean -- look , i don ' t mean to be unsympathetic about your domestic situation , whatever it is , but i ' m just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their actions , they might end up having a lot less trouble generally . that ' s all .
hey , that ' s what i ' ve been trying to tell you guys at the bank .
and what ' s the mysterious code word ?
peaches .
says they were deserters , they were afraid to fight , don ' t believe in saddam anyway . they flew the gunship up here to hide out . when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them , so they shot first .
why ' d he come in our camp .
you tell me . you tell me who went to the b . i . a . -- bureau of indian annihilation and said i was messin ' with your case , man . i don ' t give a goddamn about your case .
and i don ' t give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not , <person> , but i didn ' t cut you .
yes , sir .
they look strong - should last a month or two .
<person> is my uncle !
<person> or dutch ?

i jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked . now it ' s totally fucked ! this is a disaster !
come on man , what ' d they look like ?

i ' ve done a few things but i ' m not a murderer , mr . mckenna .
how do you know if you ' ve never tried ?
me ?
you are the guardian , <person> . you must take her to <person> .
its okay . i hardly used to see them anyway . i didn't have much parental guiding . the public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin . he was a good ol boy , stood by me . even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time .
id stand by you , sailor . through anything .
what ' s the best thing i can see tonight ?
me . <continued_utterance> the second best thing is <person> .
who cares ?
i care , and you should too . our house is going on national television tomorrow . you want your friends to think you live in a dump ?
we call this thing a stud-finder . ' it locates the spot on your spine where the x intersects with the y . we don ' t want to be even a micron out of whack . that ' s when you get troubles . it ' s a little radar/sonar/laser thingee . <person> you with a special range-finding dye .
never say dye .
just felt like it .
so let me ask you something , <person> . how good are you ?
so let ' s get some of the usual questions out of the way . why am i using a cane ? raise your hand if you were thinking that . <continued_utterance> i fractured my leg . it ' s the fifth time i ' ve done that particular bone . it didn ' t really heal well this time . <continued_utterance> raise your hand is you ' re wondering who the hell breaks the same bone five times ? <continued_utterance> i have something called <person> . it ' s a genetic disorder . i don ' t make this particular type of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density , very easy to break . i ' ve had fifty-four breaks in my life . i have the tamest version of the disorder . type one . there are type two , type three , and type four . type four ' s don ' t make it very long . that ends our lecture on the medical anomaly known as <person> . <continued_utterance> how certain are you that you haven ' t been sick in your life ?
seventy-five percent .
open it . <continued_utterance> do you know what this is ?
can you give me a clue ? it could be a water heater for all i know .
are you crazy ? this man couldn ' t possibly be the rooftop killer .
remember when you thought <person> might be the unabomber ?
ya know , <person> , we been working together for over a year .
<person> , must be about that .
oh . here ' s a bucket . you shouldn ' t be smoking but if you do could you put the cigarettes in here .
i quit now that i ' m wrestling
i thought he was in mexico .
maybe he ' s in mexico , but today he was in new york . the most brilliant and reclusive novelist in the history of the world is here , in this neighborhood . he may be living on this very block .
lem me go ! lem me go ! !
i don ' t know . we got ta get ' im outta here before skipper sees him like this .
<person> , why don ' t you get to the point where you get to the point .
why is he giving you a gift ? <continued_utterance> did you give him a gift ?
it ' s tuesday , near nine .
nine ? are you sure ?
if it ' s incurable --
i told him to leave me alone .
. no , he insisted we only call you . though it took us a while to track down your number . it ' s not on file here .
<person> handles that type of stuff .
i broke my clubs -- don ' t ask why , my caddie ' s pissed off at me , i lost my wheels in a sucker bet , and my shrink thinks i ' m a fool -- ' cause i probably am .
you ' re seeing a therapist ? !

they don ' t call them lovers in high school , leland .
the killer doesn ' t want to see this pipeline continue , doesn ' t want to see you take over .
that ' s every man within a five mile radius . including you . that ' s why you ' re here , isn ' t it ? you think i can ' t do it . you think i ' m going to screw up . or get myself killed .
jody , she tried to kill him .

if you can , you be the first .

that ' s cool .
ok . so i have to ask , those tatoo ' s must have hurt , right ?
sounds like you ' ve been reading up .
i wish there was more to read . <person> few things being written about any of this . to think of someone like fred . locked away . his mind and heart so vibrant .
she smiles at everyone , ted . she ' s like a newborn with gas . <continued_utterance> the only chick more untouchable than <person> is <person> . `` hi , my name ' s <person> . i love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . `` here ' s a tip : set it on vibrate , honey , and don ' t be stingy with the lube . <person> ' t knock it till you tried it .

my sister said she saw <person> holding hands with some college guy .
i dunno , <person> . i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare .
the owl told him about <person> . that ' s incredible . i guess we just broke the back of this investigation , didn ' t we ? evidence doesn ' t get any harder than that -- not for my money . is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court ?
he also said `` listen to the water . ``
. <number> beverage cup holders ?
standard equipment . the world ' s automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders .
do you know how many times i ' ve boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me ? particularly while i ' m on my way to pittsburgh .
lay off pittsburgh . it ' s one of the great cities .
i know a spot along the river ' s great to watch the sunset ?
not tonight .
we ' ve declared a curfew . only the extras required for the search are on the set .
all prop cars accounted for ?
and .
he saw an owl .
what the hell do they want ?
i ' d be happy to tell you . <continued_utterance> we know what you ' re up to , <person> , and let me tell you this from here , you suck eggs , mister , over my dead body you ain ' t gon na break up bluestar .
hi .
hi . how are you doing ? she nods , happy to be working with the child . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been meaning to come in a long time .
that is depressing .
why ?
that ' s right . i agree . <person> .
this is a joke .
a few billion bucks and suddenly he ' s cro-magnon man of the year .
it ' s so nice to have friends like you , <person> .
ok . thanks . i ' ll be right down .
what ?
what the hell was that ?
i don ' t know , sir . we got massive energy readings out of nowhere , then they just disappeared .

we ' re a thousand miles from anybody else , man . it ' s going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better .
<person> ?
what ? no ' . there ' s no one here . i ' m just . just .
<person> ?
<person> ? what are you doing here ? everyone and their mother ' s mother is looking for you .
i didn ' t want to have to come here . i wish that i didn ' t have to ever see you again . i ' ve gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me . i was going through life , sailing along , pretty good . doing okay , and i tried to get even with some crazy guy . and i ' m here .
the wet becomes you . <person> rid of some of the slickness .
and if that doesn ' t work ?
we offer him rewards .
who was it , <person> ? that you had the thunderbolt over ?
but it wasn ' t meant to be .
<person> well - if that fancy plows that field i ' ll give you till october to set things straight .
what if he doesn ' t ?
well . it ' s a rumor , what do i know ?
estoy desemperado !
all right , first thing ' s first : it ' s my outfit now , i ' m runnin ' the show . <person> ' s number two man .
your outfit ? i ' m next in line .
it ' s part of some plan . she dresses it up like a terrorist attack . the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium .
who ' s she ?
i think he shouldn ' t have to run and tell his mommy every time he does something she might not like , for one thing .
uh huh . and what do you --
the baby will be queen . it has been foretold , bavmorda .
my ritual will kill the prophecy ! now the child dies with it , its en- ergy exiled into oblivion ! you see ? i hold the power of the universe !
you seem to think my brother ' s a bank !
oh sheila can we just cut out the puerile crap ? ! i ' ll be back just as soon as i can . ok ? i am not the kind of man that everyone says i am .
<person> , take him to the car . <continued_utterance> who in their right mind let ' s a child ride in the baggage car !
he had polio . probably still contagious .
any idea how much ?
i ' ve read official estimates but i wouldn ' t bet my house on them . i ' ve heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor-trailers . at least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who don ' t give a damn if they ' re caught or not .
you want some breakfast meat , <person> . is that what you want ?
<person> has a flare for the dramatic . the former pittsburgh steeler running back , beat known for `` the immaculate reception , '' his improbable sixty yard <person> . i say <person> has made a bold move on corporate america . <person> has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the <person> sausage company . by taking on the challenge of resurrecting <person> ' s , <person> is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .
why ?
cuz i want new york .

why ? why ? she ' s dead . why are you calling an ambulance ?
he ' s an idiot , and he ' s not nearly as hard as he thinks .
how tough you have to be to make the army ? all you ' ve got to do is shoot a gun , and stop a bullet .
it ' s not a priority right now .
not priority . right now . why ?
<person> !
stop .
that sucked . you ' re running good , buddy . kicking my ass .
yeah . i ' ve been getting out here a bit more often .
go for it !
no ! he just needs par to tie ! tell him to lay up ! he listens to you !
he gets the whole crew on deck , gets us on the halyard , and orders the old `` heave ho . `` .
up goes the jib and out roll tod-o and the mayor ' s daughter , naked as pilot whales .
the cranial structure was based on thirty pins fastened by small panels and bits of bone from the mandible . and it seems the cartilage grafts have maintained your cheek structure . unfortunately , because you were in a coma , immediate plastic surgery was impossible .
doctors . their power is in jargon . so you study up . <continued_utterance> is that the procedure for all bilateral periorbital hematomas in a lefort iii fracture of a comatose patient ?
laura , you didn ' t come and see me today .
i couldn ' t it was <person> ' s birthday . i promised i ' d be with him . i told you not to call me here .
my father left me the business . <continued_utterance> i used to be a divorce lawyer in new york city .
not a lot of difference .
<person> , this isn ' t about you . this is something that ' s happening to me . it ' s not to get even . and it ' s not some warped bid for attention . some strange things are happening in our house , whether you believe in them or not .
sweetheart --
my badge is in my jacket . <person> pocket .

what ! ?
it ' s my party -- we ' ll be late . you called it a `` strange war '' and an `` endless story . `` if you filed that story for me , i ' d say you were editorialishing .

it ' s metal .
<person> , woods are metal -- don ' t worry about it -- and the driver ' s known as the big dog and i ' m just saying to turn him loose , let ' er rip , let the big dog eat !
i tell you something , she ' s getting on my nerves .
who , nora ?
i still like suitcases .
<person> saturday night we ' ll have a party . invite all our friends , sit out on the veranda and interview each other .

yeah , give it here .
<person> , `` dude '' .
no .
we need something : a flare , a signal mirror .
six . their plane went down right outside scranton .
<person> ?
it appears as though <person> has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings . and he is using <person> as its core .
its core ?
<person> . you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up , talking about what ' s right and what ' s wrong . you ' re from the reservation . it ' s a different world .
i ' m from minneapolis . <person> . i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res . so i know about the other world , <person> . <continued_utterance> are you gon na keep that medicine bundle or are you gon na respect its power ? <continued_utterance> thank you .
we get it at work . we get the magazine at work .
yes , we know that you do . i have it in my files . that ' s at the manhattan health center .
who are you ?
i don ' t know how to drive .
is that what changed your mind ? the money ?
i don ' t give a damn about the money . i want you , and i want to get us out of this shithole . there ' s only one way to do that .
no . i ' d hit it again because that shot was a defining moment . and when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you . i did not shrink from the challenge . i rose to it .
<number> , fort washington golf club , fresno , california , final round of the tour qualifying school .
i ' ll need you driver ' s license , social security number , and you can pick them up on friday . the <number> th .
the eighteenth ?
how you doin ' , boy ?
fine . <person> . <continued_utterance> you were right . it ' s nothin ' like i thought . i almost wish .
not long at all , but i really like him . <person> , i know he ' s a little different , tucker , but that ' s what i like about him . he ' s a guy . a real guy . he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn ' t always politically correct and he probably farts , too . and that ' s okay with me .
that ' s what you ' ve been looking for -- a farter ?
there is nothing wrong with the work i do here . i have been doing just fine , the whole time before you came here -- and if you think that riding people in this petty , ridiculous way is the way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else i think you ' re out of your mind !
i didn ' t say there was . could i please -- could i please -- may i respond ?
dont worry , son . just stay here .
im sorry , <person>or . i just cant help it . give me a minute and <person> quit .
thousand .
<person> .
no . but you can buy a drink for my friend , <person> .
<person> ?
as i ' ve said we had some more .
. they start again three minutes earlier .
and we ' re worried that it ' s too intellectual , too complex , too weird , too artsy . that argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans . she hates to be rejected in the flesh , so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat .
<number> i ' ve heard that she ' s very sensitive . <continued_utterance> what are they doing ?
leland .
<person> didn ' t wash her hands before dinner . and look at this . <continued_utterance> oh , is this from a lover ? <person> has no response . leland did you get this from your lover ?
she still think you ' re a fucking architect ?
oh yeah .
you haven ' t been given an assignment in this case .
i was the one who brought that money in .
did you like it ; me watching you ?
i guess . i ' ve got an ego same as any man .
i ' m not complainin ' . but give me credit . i ' m the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
<person> came to me . he told me he ' d fire <person> if i didn ' t do it . i went along with him for <person> ' s sake . it was only pattycake , after all .
how ' m i doing so far ?
so far you ' re great . you got a cigarette ?
you think we ought to question him ?
what time is it , <person> ?
and who ' s he ?
he ' s my roommate .
how is old <person> ?
gone fishing .
. you should rest .
<person> .
it ' s a brief flirtation , honey . <person> ' s perfectly healthy .

yeah .
<person> ?
you know , choo choo . goes on tracks . wo woo .
you ' re joking .
it ' s hard because i ' m a complete stranger and what we ' re talking about is incredibly personal . besides , the first time most people come here , a part of them is wondering if i ' m gon na think they ' re crazy . she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry , i ' m required to have at least three sessions in order to commit . <continued_utterance> now that ' s a joke . <continued_utterance> i have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life , one of which you may or may not be experiencing . if you want to get some stuff off your chest , great . if not .
all right . i want you . to .
<person> ? kill him ? . how ?
[ and i thought . ]

well we better use those twelve hours to apprehend the right man .
the right man ? talk to me , <person> .
thank you for stopping by , mr . <person> .
i thought you might want to see a friendly face . so how ' s our boy doing ?
<person> , i don ' t want to play this game anymore .
it ' s an exaggeration of the truth . maybe it ' s based on something as simple as instinct . like being able to touch someone and tell whether they ' ve done something wrong . or the level of what they ' ve done wrong .
even if i knew i wouldn ' t tell you . you do not want to come into contact with these people . only <person> knows who they are . that ' s his real asset . <person> doesn ' t know them . they don ' t know <person> . <person> and state .
what about legitimate businesses ? we own a construction concern , real estate --
can i get a banana daiquiri , please ?

well , call him back . tell him you ' ll come later .
<person> ' <person> .
i ' ve heard that name before . are you a gascon ?
the kinds of urges other girls act on impulsively , i analyze until either the urge goes away or --
or what ?
<person> . you wan na eat through a tube , be my guest .
now you ' re gon na make me enjoy this , funny guy . now i ' m gon na take the whole foot off . <person> think of that ? <continued_utterance> what ' s that , eh ? i thought you didn ' t have no friends !
all right , let ' s see some identification , everybody .

they were the ones that put us together .
because they wanted me to invalidate your work , your investigations into the paranormal . but i think this goes deeper than that .
<person> on you counselor .
is that it ?
it may have been <person> ' s way of saying `` get off my ass . ``
she ' s that subtle ?
why ?
he is the brother of my late husband , <person> de winter . he blames me for de winter ' s death .
well why don ' t you look her up ?
yeah , right .
now what ?
what just happened ?
maybe she didn ' t come here .
she came here . we ' ll just wait . in the meantime , i need you to shimmy through . <continued_utterance> relax . <person> hasn ' t carried a house key since she was twelve years old . and your hips are as slim as hers .
not if i can help it . i looked out the window at work today , and he was parked across the street , watching .
<person> ' s so uncool . so boring .
i need a horse .
<person> , we don ' t sell horses . just dogs , cats , birds .
<person> is in the kitchen .
how come you didn ' t ask <person> to help you ?
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve .
it ' s no my fault i was born first . besides , nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation , so ease up on the sad sack stuff .
bus .
<person> ? all by yourself ?
it never occurred to me to try . c ' mon , let ' s go . the car ' s over here .
i ' ll bet you a thousand dollars against my car that i can beat you in any game -- any game , you name it -- with a seven iron .
go away , ted . just go .
please believe me . it was just a kiss for old time ' s sake . i ' ve had a stupid crush on her since i was seven , but i never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me , completely naked .
do you hear buzzing fish ?
buzzing ?
there ' s a ground breaking book that just came out , <person> . not everything in it applies to you but when you see the title , i think you ' ll see that it can help .
<person> .
why ? i don ' t get it . it ' s better sitting at home and watching tv .
i think there ' s something nice about a picnic . it ' s fun .
whatever . you ' re screwed now .
really ? how screwed ? like i knew it was a rule but i ' m a little fuzzy on the exact details .
<person> , get somebody to open this door .
nice try , <person> .
it ' s not about being fun . it ' s about being smart . you take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you don ' t ever have to do anything again . ever . that ' s freedom . that ' s what i ' m talking about .
and i ' m talking about enjoying myself .
you just shop here now ?
some of our extras haven ' t had a vegetable since <person> .
that sounds great .
testing one two three four .
that ' s the whole point . they rarely work out . but on occasion they do . and when they do , they do big .
your ideas never work out .
i don ' t want to go to the children ' s <person> .
<person> . the staten island ferry .
no , <person> , you wouldn ' t be very happy there .

<person> , please . <person> and his men only patrol the roustabout cars . they don ' t work the performer train . we can hide him easy until-
until when ? what are we going to do with him ? shoot him like <person> ? because that ' s what he is <person> . in a week , he won ' t be able to move his legs at all .
they ain ' t all strictly minor league . one of ' em pays almost two grand ! <continued_utterance> now wait , <person> . you got ta do the math , and you got ta look at how good i ' m playing . i hit the shot of the tournament at the best-ball . they put it on national tv .

<person> ' t be too much longer until dawn . <person> ' s bound to come along then . a snowplow or something .
how are your hands ?

not to mention ketchup and hot peppers .
it ' s too bad you don ' t live down here , ted .
. that it will take all the skill which we can muster to lead him successfully to a recognition of his severe physical limitations without crushing him . ``
patronizing son-of-a-bitch ! i wanted to walk again .

i ' m not just helping out the old man , <person> . it ' s not like it ' s charity work . i ' m getting paid for it .
what do you want with him ? <person> smiles now , tapping his metal helmet .
canandiacute ; t read my mind ?
to make sure she ' s all right .
<person> , honey , we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of --

it may be extraterrestrial .
i don ' t believe this . i don ' t fucking believe this . y ' know , i ' ve been here . i ' ve been here one too many times with you , <person> .
i think i have to meet this <person> .
yeah . he ' s a pretty funny dude .
how you feelin ' , <person> ?
rather an obvious question under the circumstances , don ' t you <person> ? a better one might be how do you feel ?
you forgot the tent ?
i think so .
how did you find me ?
<person> , you have to check the colors of the letters for the new issue of rise .
you killed me , remember ? now i have to hide out here with you . where have you been ?
i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with . they ' ve got a of nerve agent they ' re gon na unleash .
i hope you don ' t think i ' m interested in her .
why would i think that ? just because you couldn ' t take your eyes off her --
i know , i know .
what about these low-level flights ? they ' re starting in what ? an hour ? do you realize what you ' re letting yourself in for ?
no one will be laughing at you now , ted . you can take that to the bank .
it ' s really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
<person> !
. don ' t put me in the river .
i ' m a lawyer .
my ex-husband was a lawyer .
how bout a beer ?
thatd be fine , <person> .
hello ?
can i help you ?
with a picture in it ?
it ' s to the boy who owned <person> . i want to show him how wonderful he ' s looking .
champagne ?
you know i prefer wine .
i understand .
it ' s my job to risk my life , but not yours . i feel bad about bringing you into this , but you ' re the only one i can trust .
i think . if you get eaten by a bear and there isn ' t a ranger around , i ' m not carrying what ' s left of you down this mountain .
and they say romance is dead . timber falls it is . <continued_utterance> who ' s <person> and/or <person> ?
thinkin a second , baby .
<person> scared , mama .
yes , sir . but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division . he has proposed an additional <number> million dollar payment .
. and there ' s no truth that <number> % of that money will go into your swiss bank account ?
well , we .
. you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear . <person> ' t that what you did ?
and steal <person> ' s fishin ' stuff .
i don ' t know how to fish , <person> .
i can ' t know things if you don ' t tell me .
<person> came to the play .
it ' s not my fault , you tight-assed , critical , nonfeeling , sexist drunk .
sticks and stones . it doesn ' t bother me if you sleep on the couch from now on .
you ' ll only thaw it out .
come on , <person> , we could have a great week up in vermont .
oh , yes . it ' s come over all the media now . you ' ve never been more famous . your face is everywhere , which of course just . makes it worse . i .
what ? tell me .
today .
<person> .
what law , <person> ? having fun ? letting down our hair on prom night ?
our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking .
because he is my king , and i am sworn to obey him .
exactly . just as you ' re sworn to obey me now . yes ?
lot of good times , <person> .
a lot of good times , but i can ' t live off the good times . you know , my brother-in-law has offered me a job at hess shoes . i think maybe i should do it . you get there in the morning , you come home at night . you get health benefits . i get to be assistant manager .
i do believe you . that ' s what i want everybody to believe . <person> is , it doesn ' t look like an accident and you ' re not here to tell me about it . i need you to help me here . <continued_utterance> did <person> .
no !
why did you eat that fruit ? it ' s forbidden . everybody knows that .
i couldn ' t help myself ! <person> was just staring at me with those pouty eyes -- and those perky breasts -- opposable thumbs . and how about the name ? `` the tree of the knowledge of good and <person> '' ? you don ' t think that sounds tempting ? they should ' ve just called it `` the tree with the fruit that <person> . `` then for sure nobody would eat it .
then i guess we ' re even .
how did you find out about the toxin ?
give me one good reason why i shouldn ' t kill you right now .
a gift from mr . <person> gentlemen . he turns and walks out of the room .
are you doing that on purpose , or can ' t you make up your mind ?
that ' s the trouble . i can ' t make up my mind . i haven ' t got a brain -- only straw .
i listen to crap ?
hurts me to be the one to tell you .
yeah , i sent you pictures . here ' s what i ' m thinking . if they take out the cameras and sensors , they could probably put a bomb in this thing . you drop it in the water in the red sea and three weeks later it ' s swimming up the potomac .
this is good work , x , damn fine work . you need to press on at all costs , find out what they have planned with this `` ahab '' .
i don ' t know <person> . it ' s complicated .
what ' s complicated about it ? she doesn ' t give a shit about <person> . they hate each other . you can ' t let her take him .
<person> . there ' s always some sonofabitch who doesn ' t get the word . all we need is the soviets thinking we ' re bombing them . anybody else ?
mr . president , our pilots are in danger . we must order punitive airstrikes against the sam site that shot down <person> per our rules of engagement .
mr . <person> .
who is it ?
i ' ll find one .
but wait . you ' re rich and women love you and i ' m from ohio and i ' m drunk . can i tell you the truth ?

oh yeah , i ' m with them .
<person> to a shrink ! or you can call me sometime , instead of hiding in your apartment . <person> ' t take it out on a girl you only met once .
did she say that ? i met her `` once ? '' did she say i met her `` once ? '' brian looks away . he ' s said too much .
say what you want , but that was no accident . you don ' t see a pattern here ?
i see a pattern . every time something terrible can happen to me , it does .
so you ' re <person> .
no .
oh . hey , <person> . what ' s up ?
<person>ie , i have some bad news !
skip that word .
yes , sir . it certainly was a surprise hearing from you . your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine . of course you ' ve got plenty of time to be amusing , sitting on that porch , rocking away , while we put in a full day ' s work . you always were a lucky stiff , and i envy you . a few years more , i was saying to emmy the other evening , and i ' m going to be able to take it easy like old tom .

<person> was serious about doing this guy , that ' s for sure .
yes . <person> bought it so that he could look down upon the world . for him , christian humility has always been a struggle . <continued_utterance> well , it was nice to meet you , <person> . she trudges down the slate path to the home .

if i ' m not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can i do this ?
inspector <person> , <person> . do you admit you gave these men this package ?

my baby here has now taken three major hits , one in the church , one in the gas station , and one on the operating table . the only way i can tell if everything ' s ok - the game ' s not been contaminated , the pod ' s not fucked - is to play existenz with somebody friendly . are you friendly , or are you not ?

<person> .

this is not a four-star restaurant . we ' re not having a gourmet meal . we ' re ordering breakfast , for christ sake !

i couldn ' t tell you what they did . it seemed like science fiction to me .
he ' s going to be one good-looking guy when i ' m done .
you go to <person> !
<person> ! you bitch !
how did they ever get it in here ? my front door can ' t be more than three feet wide .
looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it .
my daddy aint never killed nobody , has he , mama ?
course he aint never killed nobody .
<person> .
i mean , how can that be ? it just happened that way ? and i ' m not even getting into the fruits . i ' m just dealing with vegetables right now . with all those things coming out of the earth , there must be a god .
are you serious ?
you keep saying that . <person> at this . games i ' ve never heard of . <person> . <person> a car . viral ecstasy . <person> . in viral ecstasy , you are a virus invading a specific human body . you create ingenious viral strategies to cope with the efforts of the body ' s immune system to destroy you . ``
i thought maybe you ' d won a radio contest or something . is that single-spaced ?
afraid so .
the rest of the letter is about the family . he ' s telling me they have nothing for me , we ' re not fooling each other . thank you . <person> , it couldn ' t be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes . now could it ?
no sir . begging your pardon , sir , there ' s a lot to be said for leisure . you ' re not used to it , you ' ve always been active , but in time -
i ' ve got <person> if you need it .
i don ' t need <person> .
<person> , sure . you got change ?
change ? you want my change ? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change ?
i don ' t give a shit about the money , brendan . i told you that . we ' re gon na end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money .
you don ' t think i can do it .
i ' m sorry . i can ' t take you .
i understand . then this is where we say goodbye .
her boyfriend , i guess , but he ' s an asshole .
does she even know you ' re here ?
you said you weren ' t coming ?
i wasn ' t planning on it . particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning . but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen .
but <person>-
i won ' t be pawed at , thank you very much
eighty-eight dollars ain ' t gon na make a dent , baby girl .
<person> ' t worry about it . you want anything ?
do you have a name ?
d ' <person> .
why didn ' t you catch a plane ?
my feet have never been on anything that wasn ' t directly attached to the ground .
<person> , man , don ' t know what you ' re talking about .
i ' m talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in genoa and wind up here . if you don ' t know about ' em , who does ? <continued_utterance> i guess i heard wrong . <person> turns to leave .
i said how ' s it going ?
i didn ' t hear you .
the conversation , the coffee --
<person> - the part where we parry and joust , and get to know each other bit-by-bit . we ' re going to have to skip it . you ' ve been charged with murder . in four weeks , a judge will determine your fate based on what i write . you will talk to me --
what happened ?
we drank . we fought . he made his ancestors proud .
yeah ?
are you afraid of death ?
not good .
what the hell happened ? we used to be good .
hi . we ' re looking for <person> ?
who should i say is calling ?
there ' ll be some deterioration . that ' s inevitable , but we can ' t say how much .
during the time that you had him here , did you discover any particular habits of his , peculiarities , quirks , anything that might help me find him ?
you think i ' m gon na let some schmuck know all my business . have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that . i need some privacy .
taxes is serious stuff , <person> .
yes , your honor , she is . but mr . <person> hasn ' t seen her for over twenty years .
who ?
come on mayor , he already told you no .
what about you ? you were a lawman .
we just try to keep the general part quiet .
why ? begging your pardon , sir .
wow . what ' s your play ?
i have no idea . i have no freaking idea !
it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u . s . several years ago .
and are you familiar with fema ? what the federal emergency management agency ' s real power is ? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency . to create a non-elected government . think about that . what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas ?
for what ? because i ' m a dangerous man . because i know too much about the truth .
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write ? i knew your name was familiar .
the jotuns must pay for what they ' ve done !
they have paid with their lives . the destroyer did its job , and the casket is safe . all is well .
must be some nanny he found through an agency . peter shrugs and walks away .
she wants to see <person> .
how ? supportive letters from prison while i ' m being kicked out of our home ? do you have any idea what is happening out here ? our credit cards are maxed . the people at the bank , you should see their faces when i walk in there . i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien . our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging . <person> will help us . <person> will take us in . <person> wants anything to do with us . so tell me , <person> , how you ' re gon na make it up to me . tell me again how we ' ll get through this , and maybe while you ' re at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection .
<person> --
i never knew this place existed . <continued_utterance> come on ! come on ! it ' s wonderful !
i . i can ' t .
he ' s a juvenile idiot .
you don ' t understand what i mean by the river .
can you believe that was me ?
before we knew it , we created the most popular men ' s magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .
a new outfit bought the red car . some big company called cloverleaf industries .
no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?
i can ' t wait to see the pictures .
it was incredible . the light , the crowd , everything .
we ' re going to the morgue .
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel .
or perhaps it was the wisest choice i ' ve ever made . i will hear you .
i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers , lead you into his chambers , and let you slay him where he lies . i ' ll keep the throne , and you will have the casket .
what are you talking about ? we went through all this and the ship isn ' t even down there ?
yes , the ship is down there . but the gold is gone .
i assumed we did . i mean , here . in the game . of course , we might not .
we ' d better check .
you ' re surprised . certainly you ' ve been expecting some response to your indiscretion . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite sure whatever you told <person> , you have your good reason . it ' s a weakness in men our age ; the urge to confess . i forgive you that .
what are you doing here ? what do you want from me ?
captain <person> exhibited an arrogant , controlling attitude in my presence on more than one occasion . i believe he had a personality conflict with my son from the start .
well , if you don ' t mind my asking , sir , why did you let your son stay ?
i don ' t get it .
<person> ' t get what ?
<person> and <person> , by the artist formerly known as prince .
what was that ?
it ' s a dog , what else you got , sport , besides connections at the airport ?
mr . <person> in san fransisco .
there ' s another pass on the photo . we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .
it should , or it will ? least going back the way we came we know what we ' re up against .
i do not trust him .
i ' m not sure who to trust .
just figure it ' s my map , i ought to hang on to it .
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself .
come look at this .
whats that , honey ?
i dunno . all my things are back at nellie ' s -- the other side of town . i know what i could do , i ' ll go back to the house . there ' s still a few things i left behind . at least i can get a change of clothes .
i ' m glad this is working out .
the what ?
<person> , i don ' t understand . what happened to the chevy-nova ?
and then . i came back to life . just like that dog , <person> . <person> the dog .
<person> . <person> the dog .
<person> is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . it ' s when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you ' re afraid of .
you afraid of the dark ?
where ' s the candy ?
there is no candy !
<person> .
you said , `` <person> '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?
a similar triangle ?
what else ? what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths .
i don ' t get the distinction .
could everybody else tell you were different , or were you the only one who knew ?
at least you could consider it , honey . for me . i ' ve never asked you for anything before .
maybe i could take him , but i ' d have certain conditions . i would have to be the only dad on the scene . <person> would have to go .
i ' m exactly who i said i was , am , it ' s just-
what the hell ' s going on here ?
what do you want me to do ?
find out who this renquist it .
<person> ? . what ' s going on ?
i ' ve been played like a grand- piano -- by the master , <person> the great . and today was the big crash . liquidation sale . he ' s gon na carve <person> into little pieces and sell it all off .
<person> ' t she ?
so how ' s the book ?
i think what he ' s trying to say -- what we ' re trying to say -- is that things aren ' t exactly what they seem to be .
well , they don ' t `` seem '' to be that great so i can ' t wait for this one . hey , here we are ! two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame . bullets flying !
on your knees .
no .
<person> , well , we ' ll see what happens .
<person> on you counselor .
i ' m through the worst of it .
i don ' t believe you . <continued_utterance> was i worth this ?
who took it ?
<person> said , the tax man . gave me a dollar to tell you so .
i dont need to explain anymoren i have . you know damn well .
you need to explain it .
i told him about beating off once with her brassiere .
what did you tell him that for ?
<person> . are you serious ?
yeah .
i felt . pain . that she ' d been hurt by someone . this is great . i ' m trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my --
have you been hurt ?
i just thought i ' d drop by and show you a photograph .
i ' ve already seen your photographs .
we ' re going to lose . <continued_utterance> do you think it ' s my fault ?
isn ' t there something you .
what time did he show up ?
around four . <person> and these pachucos poppin ' switchblades like punks . the only thing that was keepin ' him `untouched ' was <person> . is he really dead ?
i ' ll know soon enough .
what killed those men can ' t be identified in simple medical terms . my god , we can ' t even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv . we have no context for what killed those men , or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future . of how it will be transmitted ; of the environmental factors involved .
id stand by you , sailor . through anything .
<person> , peanut , you stuck with me after i planted <person> . a man cant ask for more than that .
<person> ' t we just talk ?
in my office , after <person> day .
so you give her a little tap on the head . women respond to that --
no . she only likes hunters -- not gatherers .
<person> ' you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
yes .
why not ? it ' s three am .
are you drunk , <person> ?
what ?
maybe you resent how busy i ' ve been .
i thought this was your dream come true .
that ' s not why he ' s sending me .
no . it didn ' t show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
this looks like new grass to you ?
we got a tournament coming up . you gon na kill every guy in the `burgh ? <continued_utterance> <person> . get me some ice . and call that <person> kid , the one that fights outa the bottoms . if he ' s here in <number> minutes , he gets <number> bucks .
yo , i ' ll fight him .
are you sure you ' re okay ?
i ' m fine .
me an ' you -- like the old days .
. well , put ' er there , partner ! these two homeboys are gon na show the world what golf in west texas is all about !
but you know that it is a war , old friend . and to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs , by any means necessary . and for that reason , i will always have the advantage . no matter how you trap me , how i am contained - chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation
and i will always be there , old friend .
will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes ? <continued_utterance> what the hell do you want ?
i found out about the garage sale down at bluestar . why ?
this has got to be a mistake .
the only mistake is that they didn ' t kill us in the elevator . <continued_utterance> wait here .
what ?
you heard me . a gun ? i left mine in the car .
i get a ' s . all a ' s .
you do ? what else you do ?
i got a problem with you not doing your job , burbank . you already screwed up once this week .
let me worry about that .
on top of teresa in bed . all whispers .
when ' s the next business trip , big fella ?
i wanted to thank you , <person> , for saving my flock .
oh , hey - it was nothing .
<person> ' s fallen into the <person>sleep . my mother fears he may never awaken again .
we would speak with her .
i ' m asking you seriously , <person> , a stranger ?
i don ' t know , honey . i guess it would depend .
each day is better than the next . have you ever been , you know . in love with someone ?
nah .
he ' s spoken of you . he says you ' re becoming friends .
we are . <continued_utterance> he ' s doing well today .
thats true . uncle <person> wasn't really an uncle . he was a business partner of my daddys ? and my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure . his real name was somethin kind of european , like <person> . but everyone just called him <person> . he came around the house sometimes when <person> was away . i always figured he was sweet on mama , so when he cornered me one afternoon , i was surprised moren a little .
howd it happen , peanut ? he just pull out the old toad and let it croak ?
i want to call her and tell her im okay . that were okay .
i aint so sure its a great idea , but thats up to you . just dont tell her where we are .
now you need me .
what is it ? you know so much about arabland tell me what it is .
but you don ' t refuse to believe in them because of that ?
not if i can see the proof with my own eyes .
i told him to make sure you were safe until this was over .
you shouldn ' t worry about me .
<person> , what in the world are you doing ?
what the hell is this ?
you ' re overreacting .
<person> ' t tell me how to react !
get up and don ' t make a sound !
dr . m . ! everybody ' s looking for you .
i wanted to think he ' d changed .
no you didn ' t . but he did change . just not enough .
what kind of whispering ?
i don ' t know . just . whispering .
hi .
hi , <person> . nice to meet you .
here . hold her .
i tried everything . a spoon . i poured milk into her mouth , she just spat it out . i don ' t know what to do , i ' m not a mother .

that ' s not right . the clock .
<person> . who the hell are you ?
gieg , <person> .
he wanted to know if a grady trip ? lived here and drove a dark maroon <number> ford <person> <number> with black interior .
what ' d you tell him ?
after graduation . maybe we could go away together ?
whatever you want .
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers .
my name is <person> . now i ' m not a stranger anymore . see how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
<person> ' t you hear me banging in there ?
when ?
brian . where are you ?
i ' m buying milk . i just thought i ' d say hello . <continued_utterance> look , i know it ' s probably too late , but is there any way you can come out for a little while ?
and just in case , i ' ve written the number of the children ' s <person> and <person> here , too .
<person> , in ten seconds i eat the staircase .
<person> looked pretty dead , himself . bullets don ' t kill these <person> .
we should have jumped his ass .
there ' s nothing to tell .
but did you tell him ?
she ' s waiting for someone .
probably waiting for me .
take comfort , son , you ' re not the first man whose wife played pattycake on him .
i don ' t believe it . i won ' t believe it .
god help me .
i heard they do this on photo shoots . wan na to do the other one ?
eleven-thirty .
a . m . or p . m . ?
i wanted to humiliate the guy . here i am , out busting my ass all day making a decent living , i come home , and some schmuck is trying to steal from me .
so you hit him with a gun , and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes ?
i had an appointment at his office , i think i must have got it wrong . we had a meeting .
he ' s not in , <person> .
well , it was just a dream , i --
<person> ! what ' s with you , <person> ? who are you ?
<person> . i was wonder --
-- i can ' t go out with you .
what is wrong with you people ? i ' m a helper here .
your investment ideas never work out .
well , well . as i live and breathe . i didn ' t expect to be seeing the like of you again . thought you ' d be long on your way by now .
that ' s my gun . that fucking <person> !
it wasn ' t an accident that you and i ended up on the run together .
not an accident ? <person> hefts the submachine gun in his hands .
whose side are you on ? !
<person> , <person> .
really ? <person> , i suggest we look at your father ' s firing as a blessing in disguise .
how so ?
<person> .
you can call me <person> . you ' re very brave to do this . you opened it .
oh . <continued_utterance> . yes .
<person> --
do -- do you suppose we ' ll meet any wild animals ?
we might .
dr . m . ! everybody ' s looking for you .
i said shut up !
<person> , alright . i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> can i just ask you one other thing ?
maybe .
drugs weren ' t even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem . opiates . but , who was using ' em ? chinese immigrants . <person> labor . and the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music . <person> on the fringe . artists . decadent rich people . and who got scared ? white men in power . who ' s scared today ? white men in power . if j . p . <person> and <person> . <person> ever admitted using , it ' d be a whole different story .
what you want ?
what do you want me to do about it ?
i want you to take care of <person> , so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again .
why did you come here , <person> ?
i -just wanted to see her , i guess -- <person> . and to see you too-you and irene . and to let everyone know that , even though it may be difficult to comprehend now , this-everything that ' s happening-it ' s not forever . it doesn ' t mean `` goodbye . ``
well , why don ' t you use them ? when you come home , don ' t go by <person> ' s place . then <person> won ' t get in her garden , and you won ' t get in no trouble .
oh , hunk , you just won ' t listen , that ' s all .
the problem is i don ' t happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people .
whacking ?
no , of course not . it wasn ' t an accident at all . it was attempted murder !
<person> , please .
yes ?
they need this in the back room . they asked for you .
i don ' t want to see people killed any more than you . but we try to help out we die , and all we do is die .
we can ' t just go off and --
<person> , then . <person> hardapple . the scar ' s are from a -- from a horse . he fell during a race and got trampled .
and now he ' s addicted to painkillers .
it ' s a problem .
i lost you when i got in that car . i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> but remember what you told me once ? every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around .
hey ! !
she ' s sick !
right . <continued_utterance> what was it about ?
you don ' t remember ?
. i think rust .
rust ?
i want you to call <person> .
what for ?
interpreted by another guy like my father .
your father doesn ' t like me .
what can i tell you ?
how did the car get back here ?
but <person> won ' t let you .
if i ' m the show ' s vet then it ' s my decision , isn ' t it ?
i swear . <person> , i almost feel like i know you .
well . you don ' t .
no , she needs to burp -- i ' ve got ta rock her for a little .
i ' m telling you , the more you pick her up , the longer it ' ll take her to get to sleep .
<person> thought , <person> . <continued_utterance> dollar bills . and he swings . <continued_utterance> who hit that shot ? anybody see ? he addresses another one . and swings .
a little thin , boss .
why shouldn ' t he hear me ? <person> ' t you get it , he ' s a sick person . a multiphobic mess ! he faked suicide .
<person> ' t that a cry for help ?
i ' m sorry , i guess . not for looking for the gold , or leaving my post . you know what it ' s like to have gold raining out of your hands ? that ' ll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig . i ' m just sorry about <person> . he was all right . it was the gold that made him what he became . if i hadn ' t found that map , if i hadn ' t talked them into going searching . <person> just might have made it home after all . i guess i feel responsible for him .
the way i view things you ' re responsible for the lives of two men : private first class <person> hanmond , and <person> <person> .
she ' s beautiful .
extremely .
i ' m glad i decided to come back for you , <person> .
can i ask you a question . <continued_utterance> what ' s it like ? being a criminal ?
well , she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad . <continued_utterance> she likes to sit on <person> ' s lap while he eats and blow in his ear . <continued_utterance> and she calls him `` thunder rod '' and he calls her `` <person> . `` super : at this point <person> has turned bright red .
you are confined to your room until school starts , you sick pervert .
<person> , voices , music , humming . all of it can turn me on , or off , like a switch .
i see .
it ' s just that . <person> . i wouldn ' t have thought .
<person> , the good news is i have all the information you need . got it from her bookie -- nice guy . you should definitely call her , <person> . i mean she ' s a real sparkplug , that one . she seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help i ' ll bet she does it .
not the usual swiss procedure , mr . <person> , but you understand , a man in my position .
which is neutral , no doubt .
iandiacute ; m sorry . iandiacute ; m not like the rest of you -- iandiacute ; m tired of hurting people . she starts to cry now .
itandiacute ; s okay .
what ?
so <person> , when were you going to tell me about the <number> million dollars we got in from san francisco two days after i got arrested ?
i bet if you ' d promised <person> some moccasins he ' d of got ' em .
no talk about <person> , okay ? and ditto the moccasins . we , can ' t , afford , them .
<person> well ! throw that basket in the river and drown him !
no ! no -- no ! here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back toto .
that ' s the life spark . exxence of magic and sorcery !
ouch ! !
<person> ginger paralysis .
no such thing . is there <person> ?
yes .
the bleeding has stopped but it will need stitches . you will have to fill out this form . how will this be covered , insurance , cash or check ?
<person> ? is everything okay , honey ?
yeah baby . everything ' s great .
such a pretty voice . surprised she didn ' t major in music . that ' s the last picture . a phone rings in the hallway . <continued_utterance> s ' cuse me . <continued_utterance> they ' re calling me in to work .
i should be going anyway .
<person> ?
yes ?
i hope you do . we need the money .
<person> , there are more important things in life than money .
god , you ' ve got a beautiful swing --

the plumber came yesterday . he said they have to dig under the slab or something and it ' s going to be six hundred dollars to fix .
uh huh . <person> .
i ' m talking about you , <person> --
you got your son back . <continued_utterance> you know , part of the reason i stuck around was `cause i thought i ' d finally get you all to myself . but you didn ' t have any interest in training me . <person> was the one .
about anybody but yourself . you never have .
and you ' re a little fucking reject .
place it on the altar .

lieutenant !
the way has been lost in time . but there is one person , a druid sor- ceress , who might guide you there . she was exiled by <person> many years ago . her name is <person> .
you need a warrior for this job .
curiosity , i guess .
about what ? how to improve your breast stroke ?

<person> ?
. <person> wants to play financial chicken with me , we ' ll see who swerves first . where the hell ' s gene ?
you sent him to vermont to get the deposition from the ceo <person> fired .
and , of course , we are .
well , you never can tell these days , can you ?
you ' d resort to any theory to not take care of her . just because you ' ve read some books .
can you believe what he just said to me . i read those books bec .
<person> , lightsnack , you stay away from <person> . he ' s mine , and no one is taking him away from me .
what are you talking about ? where ' s that bonding strip ? !
i don ' t know . if he ' d ' ve asked me this time last year i would have probably said yes . but the minute he said it , i don ' t know , i felt like somebody was trying to strangle me .
well . bad sign .
arrested ? ! ?
for grand theft auto . they found his prints in your father ' s car .
but we all need that too . hold him . <continued_utterance> you make a pretty couple . <continued_utterance> won this in a poker game in reno . god knows who it ' s registered to . you shoulda been more careful , <person> . see you later . <continued_utterance> now all we got to do is try <continued_utterance> <person> ! help me , <person> . ! we been through too much together . we ' ve only had one day , but you and me have been through more than most people ever will . i know you were angry at me , and , you know , you were right ! i ' m sorry i hit you . i was wrong about leaving you . you don ' t belong in mexico . <continued_utterance> thank you . thank you . i . i knew you wouldn ' t leave me , <person> .
<person> ? are you all right ?

-your ticket to immortality ?
<person> told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago . <person> with <person> at universal . he thought he was humoring me . until i got it . they offered me the role . there in the room . so <person> , who i ' m sure never thought in a million years i ' d land that part , makes some phone calls and just like that they don ' t want me anymore . nobody calls now . i can ' t get in to see any studio casting people . he ' s ruined me in those circles .
well i can ' t really comment on what `` a lot of people '' thought . i can only tell you that we had a horrible accident here and were all feeling extremely traumatized and your questions are a bit poorly timed . we ' re in full on grieving mode right now thank you very much officer . <person> .
<person> .

traveling light , huh ? okay , here we go . <continued_utterance> to the west !
that ' s west .
actually , it ' s not that i don ' t want to go . it ' s just that i ' ve never been on a boat and i ' m not sure i can handle it .
there ' s nothing to it . <person> ' s doing the sailing .
will you be sure to tell them about it ?
absolutely . <person> ' t worry about a thing .
yeah . of course . what ?
<person> told me that some judge made him move into that place . is that true or is he just making that up ?
oh - i ' ll get it !
oh ! oh ! <continued_utterance> oh --
what are you talking about ? the monthly payments on your <person> are more than this whole house . why don ' t you get yourself something cheaper , like a chevy ?
it doesn ' t instill confidence in my clients . <person> means that you ' re dealing with someone of importance . i thought i had a couple tonight . they just slipped away . slipped away . i ' m gon na take a bath -- my neck ' s been tight since this morning .
<person> our surprise when they began to gestate . my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists , facilitating their programs . to give us access to the virus . in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure . so that we might save ourselves , as the last of the species . your father wisely refused to believe this , choosing hope over selfishness . <person> is the only future he had : his children , the only future any of us have .
but . he sacrificed his own daughter .
i went to the hotel . <person> shot at somebody . i found a shell casing . i ' ll have it analyzed in the morning .
i ' d like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning .

ah , i ' d sell that . <person> fresh in a new place , quit the architect game , slow things down , read more books , see more movies .
you ' re a movie buff ?
it wouldn ' t have made a difference to you , now would it ? not a wit . do you know why ? because you ' re a man without scruples .
wait a second --
i don ' t see <person> winning . fuck it , i ' m not gon na even place the bet . i just made a hundred bucks .

dewey . i ' m the one asking the riddle . i already know the answer . i don ' t getta guess . although . we could say if i get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle , i get the pot . and i know what you ' re thinking . it ' s an impossible riddle . well , it ' s not . it ' s an easy riddle . and if somehow by the grace of fluke luck i win , and you all don ' t agree it was an easy riddle , hell , i ' ll refund your money .
i ' m in . we ' re in . count us in . etc .
i ' m the one who was tailing you .
oh , yeah , the park . the diaper and all .

hm .
how did i get here last night ?

she wants to lay down . i ' m a little worried .
what do they expect . the way men dress these days . then they scream rape .
you know -- let ' s really do it .
<person> ' t know . <person> for him for a bit . couldn ' t find him .
you ' re saying he wasn ' t put into the kennel until the night ?
well . bad sign .

and what ' s the little girl ' s name ?
<person> .

i can smell your blood , your sweat . i know you ' re close .
you really think your icicles are a match for <person>ian steel ? <continued_utterance> fair enough . <continued_utterance> could we stop just a moment while i get another sword ?
that ' s unfortunate .
what is it ?
it ' s the eight hundred on fordnee lane . i haven ' t got it .
-- did you understand me when i said that --
-- violation of the major crimes act on an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of instigation . i know that .
a laugh can be a powerful thing , <person> . sometimes it ' s the only weapon we have in life .
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety .
i ' m not the police . i don ' t care about experimentation . she ' s a kid .
you won ' t say anything to my parents ?
he says he saw you in a vision some time ago . <continued_utterance> i guess he had this vision some time ago , in the moon of the popping trees -- uh , back in the winter . he says you come from wasi ' cu city in the east but that your people . way back . are of the minniconjou sioux . but you yourself don ' t know that . <continued_utterance> he says he knew you ' d be coming to <person> . he was told . it is the will of tunkasilia -- the grandfather that you come here . he says let ' s smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe , symbol of truth . so that there will be no lies between us .
what ' s he smoke in that ?
how did you find out about the toxin ?
sid <number> . <number> told me after he killed the two guards . he suggested i kill you rather than him .
hm ?
a salesman -- that ' s what i am . i mean , i ' m gon na be anyway . i ' m starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as i get enough seed money .
she didn ' t hear barking . so they were either lousy guard dogs . or they knew the killer . you can ' t hit something this clean unless you ' re point blank . he could ' ve been petting them when he fired : look at the burn pattern- like when you shoot something with a silencer .
how do you know that ?
<person> , i know you get approached a lot by dubious men , but i ' m different , i never talk to strangers , all my life i ' ve been waiting for the right person to walk across the room . you ' re that person , you don ' t know it but i do and if you walk away now i ' ll never see you again or you me . you ' ll grow old .
oh really .

among others .
<person> and i are close friends !
you don ' t have to go to services ?

i ' m freezing . i can ' t feel my toes .

they think that i had something to so with this .
i ' m going to handle this exactly the way your father would have handled this . i ' ve got it solved .

you can ' t seriously want to play games now . not here . not while we ' re being hunted down by crazy people . _
indeed . please . <continued_utterance> thanks for your time on a sunday .
where ' s mr . <person> ?
i turned my gaze upon you in jotunheim , but could neither see nor hear you . you were shrouded from me , like the frost giants who entered this realm .
<person> your senses have weakened after your many years of service .
this experiment can be performed only once . if it succeeds , i lose my model forever . that is why i need witnesses .
go ahead .
i can ' t . but i did enjoy the dress rehearsal .
<person> tien , mr . <person> .
<person> ' t be afraid , dad . everything will be okay . you deserve to be loved .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ? is <person> there ?
<person> , this guy gets on my nerves . from day one ! i knew it then and i know it now .
i ' m back to pressing charges against you !
the victory of realism . and you were part of it .
the death of existenz . and we were part of it .
<person> . <person> , dear . it ' s <person> , darling .
oh , <person> -- it ' s you !
the answer is no .
mr . <person> will be most -

what do you figure it is ?
yeah .
what ' s he doing up here ?
you ' re right . that is all tha matters .
well , <person> , you said you had what we want . we ' re waiting .
well me , i was really bummed out at first . i got knocked out of the game so soon . it was fun to watch the rest , though . i liked that part where the ones who got knocked out of the game early got to be spooky customers in the game store .
but you were so wonderfully bad . so scary and crazy . i had a lot to do in that first scene in the church but i thought my character was kind of boring .
<person> ' t call me a <person> . my name is <person> .
<person> , <person> . i ' m madmartigan . <continued_utterance> you a woodcutter ?
what do you think of the cap ? <continued_utterance> <person> lining . i quite like it .
i ' m not sure it ' s going to make a lot of difference to the germans .
that one .
<person> , right . <person> .
what ' re you doing ? you can ' t fight this man .
why not ?
no sir . begging your pardon , sir , there ' s a lot to be said for leisure . you ' re not used to it , you ' ve always been active , but in time -
never kid a kidder . go on back to the hotel .
no i ' m not .
you ' re not ? !
i care , and you should too . our house is going on national television tomorrow . you want your friends to think you live in a dump ?
my friends would respect me for it .
how long will it take to get someone up ?
fifteen minutes , maybe . to your house , sir ?
sure , no problem . he immerses himself again in his books .
<person> ' t the baby be in bed by now ?
i didn ' t sleep with him .
. just so she could cut them off .
it ' s so frustrating .
did you meet the president ?
how long ?
she didn ' t cone home last night . we found her car at the bus terminal , but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket .
i ' ve met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , <person> , are positively funereal !
well , right now it ' s gon na be your funereal .
you do ? is he a funny uncle ? ' cause if he is , then he and i got somethin ' in common .
i don ' t mean to be rude , but i ' ve got something i need to talk to my friend about . in private .
we would speak with her .
she has refused to leave my father ' s bedside . you can bring your `` urgent '' matter to me , your king .
a body keeps hoping .
that was the nicest thing i ever saw anybody do .
no trouble at all , really . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t nothing .
oh , this isn ' t my car . it ' s down a ways . i should have parked closer . i just didn ' t think it would be so heavy . i could drive up .
you ' ve got to take the plates off , <person> .
i don ' t want to know what ' s under here .
you know who this is for ?
me !
you can ' t --
just , just a little coffee ?
he was driving the car that hit <person> --
by accident --
she ' s off with <person> , that ' s her boyfriend .
that ' s lonely for you , i guess . i always think of motel rooms as lonely .
at least i wouldn ' t be pulling the trigger .
are you mad ! why are you doing this ! we ' re so close , the town is going to be ours . <person> ' t throw away your future <person> !
in a minute .
come on , burt , we can ' t hold still long . they ' re damn smart and getting smarter by the minute .
i ' ve never seen so far . have you ? look at it . as far as the eye can see and it ' s nowhere near all that ' s out there .
are you all right ?
i ' m sorry , this can ' t wait .
will you gentlemen excuse us for a few minutes ? <continued_utterance> what the hell do you want ?
you expect more what ?
you ' re going to be hungover for three days . like those guys on `` oprah '' that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them .
not really .
<person> ' t lie to me . <person> . <continued_utterance> i got it on spring break . <person> like hell .
wow . <person> here just in time . i brought you this .

how am i gon na do that ?

i don ' t take those assignments .
that is my permiso .

but you ' re hopeful ?
hi , <person> .
<person> ? you want to be in `` heaven ? ''

he ' s right . they get set up in them rocks it ' s the end for us .
i ' m worn out but won ' t you feel like you are taking in a stranger ?
stranger my foot , it was my grandmother who helped you into this world .
right . she ' s only fourteen .
uh huh . and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm . i say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin ' her .
oh , my !
lions and tigers and bears !
is he here ?
what ?
this isn ' t about getting better is it ? you don ' t want to come home .
i refuse to be a burden to anyone .
is that right ? so we all share the same guilt . <continued_utterance> here . this is <person> <person> shortly after he was admitted here in <number> . <continued_utterance> -- to put the situation right . the hypodermic needles are only used to give you medication that will calm you down . they make you feel good , relaxed . all right ? we ' re not putting anything in your food either . the food is just food .
no . i don ' t eat the food . it doesn ' t taste right .
well , aren ' t you going to take him with you ?
if he had died in our care , we would be required to take him . since we found him dead , you will have to wait for the county to pick him up .

what you just said . say it again .
we ' ve got enough that ' s going down between the two of us , but the fact of the matter is that i love your wife , and i want to marry her .
i don ' t care who she marries , but i don ' t want her marrying you !
who would i be expecting here ?
you just keep looking around , that ' s all .
' of course i prayed -- and did god care ? he cared as much as on the air a bird had stamped her foot and cried , `` give me '' . ' now . what is the tone of this short poem ?
is it religious ?
no , he ' s out there somewhere .
out where ?
the lesson being ?
sometimes you have to do stuff you don ' t want to do . it ' s all part of growing up . and it usually works out peachy in the end .
. a turner , a perfect canary diaiaond . a lear jet . world peace . the best of everything .
well , why stop at that ?
it ' s not difficult to talk . it ' s difficult to explain . i coulda laid up and still won . i made a twelve on the last hole of the u . s . open . you know how much money that cost me ? <person> cost you a bundle . <continued_utterance> i got ta get outta here . <person> it was the greatest <number> i ever saw . back to you , <person> .
<person> <number> i ever saw . you crunched that dog , baby . gorgeous shot , etc .

well . the way i figure it , if it weren ' t called `` death '' , it wouldn ' t be so bad . i mean what if it were called `` dink '' ?
who did you break up with ?
patricia . you met her .
what ?

how long they been out now ?
forty . forty-five minutes .
<person> , these things are absolutely unprecedented !
yeah , but where ' d they come from ?
i ain ' t just some jerk driving- range pro who drinks too much booze and eats too few vegetables .
you ' re being defensive -- cut to the chase and tell me why you ' re here .
i don ' t know . i guess i needed something .
what did you need ?
it says here thirty-eight . thirty- eight times . <continued_utterance> what will happen to him now , without the drugs he was on ?
there ' ll be some deterioration . that ' s inevitable , but we can ' t say how much .
i ' m coming !
what took you so long ?
goddamn cruises .
<person> ' t she want to take her ?
what was ?
to jump all over you when i ' m the one who ' s really . oh , <person> , i don ' t know how to say this --

if you say ' look for the good stuff , ' i ' m gon na get <person> ' s <number> / <number> and shoot myself !
<person> kelly , lovely woman . i think we might have had a date once . or maybe we just exchange letters .
you wrote her letters ?
i ' m afraid she ' ll say no .
ahh . so what you ' re saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game -- not about your personal life .
just do it ! this is no time for small talk .
how did you know where to find me ?
i ' d give anything to have this in my house , even for a week .

<person> ?
<person> .
yes . she followed me down the street . she wanted to talk , and i had that buzz . from you and me , and i think my mind was on that terrible drawing of me . and , you know , i got inside . and she drove me off a bridge and committed suicide with me in the car .
because you ' re a cripple , verbal . because you ' re stupid . because you were weaker than them . because you couldn ' t see far enough into him to know the truth . <continued_utterance> if he ' s dead , verbal - if what you say is true , then it won ' t matter . it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york , wasn ' t it ? tell me the truth .
it was all <person> . we followed him from the beginning . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t know . i saw him die . i believe he ' s dead . christ
she could have hurt me if she wanted to .

nobody knows about your mental retardation .
nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation .

mm-hmm .
there ' s a ghost in my house . <continued_utterance> she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio . she likes rock and roll . <person> rock and roll .
when this kind of fire starts . it is very hard to put out .
<person> ?
of course i ' m excited <person> . the last person they interviewed on vacation was dr ruth . <continued_utterance> he didn ' t dive .
no .
wow . who saw that coming ?
now what ?
he ' s a really sweet kid . our girls love him .
that ' s nice . <continued_utterance> i am so sorry about this . it ' s just been such a difficult time .
mr . president , this will never be done . you need not be concerned .
so i do not misunderstand you : there are no offensive weapons in cuba .
it ' s right here . this region ; an-nagaf . i got recon photos . there ' re no troops there , no fighting --
you don ' t know where the iraqis have moved to . and our forces haven ' t even engaged the republican guard yet , we don ' t know --
so . any decisions ? or -- do you still want to think about it some more . ?
well -- i mean -- i don ' t know , <person> . i mean , we haven ' t exactly been going steady the last few months , if you know what i mean --
another month in this desert and i might just .
think we ' re going to do it ? think we ' re going to war ?
oh really . home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant .
oh it ' s just a rental . i ' m moving to the east side soon . i ' ve got a couple of deals brewing with <person> . but that ' s just conversation . what about real things ? like dinner . the two of us . friday . <person> . <person> .
they ' re not . i had the pictures .
<person> up ! both of you shut the hell up !
no , actually they had to leave unexpectedly . they had to catch a plane .
is she teething ?
well there are performers .
and then there are performers . considering we used to keep the goats in here , i ' m sure <person> ' s horses out there object to now sharing their quarters with you . of course i can always change that and send you back to a bottom bunk with the other kinkers who sorely miss your sunny personality and affectionate camaraderie . this gentleman is the show ' s new veterinarian - ivy league no less - which puts him a good deal higher than you in my estimation . perhaps you ' d like to offer him your cot .
this is <person> . <person> if you can guess his specialty .
oral hygiene ?
in english , please .
i accidentally triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program . <continued_utterance> it was very wellhidden . there was no way to see it until it was too late .
hello , <person> .
<person> ? ! ? what are you doing here ?
i can ' t do this without you .
you . i ' ve got cancer , franklin . it ' s spread everywhere .
sodium amytal , maybe some other truth agent .
it makes you tell the truth ?
<person> , <person> . we want you to tell us about the day mr . <person> gave you and <person> a ride .
you didn ' t tell me you were gon na put me on the fucking news .
yessir .
then lem me throw in a couple more things . <continued_utterance> <person> got ta eat , too . <continued_utterance> id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one , if its same to you .
did you ever ?
depends on what you call love . i grew up on a reservation . a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . that ' s where they stick indians , <person> . that ' s where they leave us to die . my brother killed himself when he was <number> cause he couldn ' t take it anymore . there ' s no hope there . <person> was my ticket out . <person> and me .
you have any idea where we ' re going ?
to the city . i have to find maya .
i guess this must be destiny alright . my first yuppie apartment and . my first yuppie .
you may call me a yuppie . it ' s <person> to you . <continued_utterance> so . see you friday .
i normally like the countryside , don ' t you ? normally , the country is relaxing and calm .
only if you don ' t really know what ' s going on .
oh , no -- no !
that ' s all -- the crystal ' s gone dark .
why -
it just is . <person> .
<person> ?
yeah , <person> ! you can tell her she ' s got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps !
are you being literal or figurative ? because literally it looks bad . and figuratively it looks even worse . the superintendent ' s coming by in a few minutes . so gim me a little help here , brendan . can you explain to me what the hell you were doing ?
i need the money , <person> .
we ' re getting everyone together as fast as we can .
what does the letter say ?
feur , i think . <person> department . figures . they ' re all psychotic .
she ' s awake .
`` . hearing the crash on nearby <person> <number> , they braved inclement weather to administer last rights . ``
that must be what we saw them doing !
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ?
this is different .
no . anti-existenzialists . <person> , capital z . they somehow found out about existenz and they want to kill you for creating it . they say that the existenz game system will `` finally destroy reality '' , or something totally nuts like that .
yeah .
somewhere else ? mister , somewhere else is fifty miles from here . only other gas station down in town closed <number> years ago when the mine got shut .
<person> , i ' m stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?
yes . <continued_utterance> she was damaged and unstable . the more i tried to distance myself , the more desperate she became . finally , she showed up at the new house .
how did she know where it was ? <continued_utterance> our dream house .
<person> about moving .
as long as i ' m in my apartment , i ' m okay . i have a phone job -- selling dental supplies -- and that ' s fine . but when i have to go out , i get . , weird .
you have to believe to have faith .
you don ' t believe in anything ?
exactly . if they ' re sane and human like we are , then maybe we just refuse , and they ' ll let it slide , like we ' ve been letting things slide .
so we reject the second letter .
what ' s the acreage here ?
roughly twelve hundred or so . why ?
aw julie , it ' s my job . it ' s like being a doctor .
you ' re telling me you don ' t get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .
you sure ? you never . to class or anything ? because i could swear i-
never .
you ' re not going to believe this -- i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story . . exclusive . eat your heart out .
what ' d ya get ?
hey , ted . wan na go shopping ?
shopping , really ? i should tell my friend .
come on .
<person> is something you earn , over time . you don ' t just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire .
i ' ll go bribe the judges !
i don ' t think this is a joking matter , gentlemen .
i ' m not going to let you kill him .
we ' re at war .
and then what , <person> ? we ' d be back to where we were five years ago . you ' re talking like a teenager .
maybe i
no , i don ' t .
<person> leave me alone .
i do . yes .
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
that ' s right --
i think you don ' t know how to behave around an eight-year-old .
you ' re working late .
how did your wife like the bank ?
you ' re being defensive -- cut to the chase and tell me why you ' re here .
well . i ' m smitten with a woman .
iandiacute ; ll never understand your regard for them , <person> .
and iandiacute ; ll never understand terrorists .
lions and tigers and bears !
oh , my !
you answered it ?
yeah , well , i saw it was your mom and we ' ve been waiting to hear from her .
<person> , i hear you ' re pretty good . so why ' d you quit ? <continued_utterance> you don ' t have to tell me . it ' s alright . <continued_utterance> do you like tacos ?
<person> .
i haven ' t forgotten .
<person> , he ' s not looking inside . he ' s just striking out at the world .
<person> chop action !
wow !
<person> .
tell her to make sure mary gets plenty of sleep .
meanness ? let me tell you --
<person> ' t misunderstand me , i ' m just paying you a compliment .
i never asked you to quit !
. oh bullshit . you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife , perfect family .
i think so .
you ' ve got about four minutes to find out if you ' re wrong .
is that right , mr . <person> ?
did you know <person> ?
<person> ' s go , <person> . <person> , i ' ll pick up the rest of my things tomorrow .
not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe .
did you ever play her game artgod ? one word , capital a , capital g ?
i don ' t have a bioport , remember ?
oh , <person> !
two vehicles . they ' re not supposed to be here .
that ' s what i thought . <continued_utterance> <person> , a second blanket . one for me , one for you .
<person> ?
<person> , i ' ve come to apologize for lt . mcelroy . he overstated the department ' s position .
he accused <person> of taking kickbacks . and you know anybody who knows <person> knows that ' s a goddamn lie !
do you have your ticket ?
yes .
we ' re ported into a game-pod together , remember ? existenz has complete access to both our central nervous systems . its game architecture will be based on our memories , our anxieties , our preoccupations .
are you serious ?
how do you do .
hey ! give me that baby !
of course , <person> . but as long as there ' s any question , better <person>ny should come back and clear his name .
better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace !
my horse will not survive another league .
and you ?
here . put these on . time to go .
um . thanks . where are we going ?
you been drinkin , huh ?
few beers is all . <person> any better ?
no . in the brains . what little im sure he has .
you want me to shoot <person> in the brains with a gun .
hey , <person> . what ' s up .
i ' m looking for a favor . i need a map of iraqi .
i don ' t want to listen to this again .
if we made a trade , we ' d be giving in to extortion , and nat<person> would never trust us again . we ' ll get clobbered in world opinion .
hey , come on . we ' ve got to have at least one victory party .
kelly , for christ ' s sake . <continued_utterance> the only way we ' re gon na blow this now , is if we do it ourselves .
and if i resist . ?
i will kill you with my bare hands .
more or less .
<person> ?
what do you mean ?
at night . he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . i heard him . my <person> told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there . maybe more . <person> ' s eyes widen in hope .
they kid a lot .
i would not be too sure . <continued_utterance> he says you look very tired . i thought the same thing . <continued_utterance> but not a good tired .
hey , slow pokes , guess what ? there ' s no tomorrow . <continued_utterance> <person> , you know why ? cause it ' ll never get here .
hey , <person> .
oh , hell .
well , hello .
. and someone else ' s .
we share an eye for human frailty and we ' re both born blackmailers <person> . i knew young stemmons here had a fondness for lads , stretching back to his days at the academy .
i need to get my suitcase out of the garage .
what for ?
no i ' m not .
oh come off it , <person> . what about what ' s-his-name . <person> ? you could ' ve at least passed the baton on that one .
i don ' t buy that reform story for a minute . and even if i did , i certainly don ' t believe he would send you to protect her . so why ?
because he was my friend .
<person> .
explain it . i told you .
because that ' s where i would aim : a subpoenaed federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two lapd detectives ? this screams police corruption . this offers noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines .
<person> did that stint at the nut house -- leak his file to your friends at the times-
<person> ' t know `em .
i know you don ' t know them . of course you don ' t know them .
how about a hippopotamus ?
why , i ' d thrash him from top to bottomamus !
- actually no i don ' t . i ' ve been married for twenty-two years .
ah , you ' ve got dinner with your daughters .
seventy-five percent ? that ' s not nearly good enough for me . i ' m extremely skeptical .
skeptical about what ?
i think they shoot right outta its mouth , hook you , and pull you right in . <person> thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else .
<person> , i ' m lucky it didn ' t find
who is he ?
i don ' t know much about him .
what are you talking about ? where ' s that bonding strip ? !
and another thing . stop with this spaceman thing . it ' s getting on my nerves .
<person> ' s missing !
oh , shit ! well , hang on !
i know , you ' re incredibly busy .
<person> . i ' ve raised my rate . i might even cut my sessions to forty minutes .
not for me it isn ' t . got a whole packet of clippings for you , mr . <person> . from a mr . <person> . new york times , journal-american . don ' t know what else . <continued_utterance> your mother wants to know when you ' re coming home . she says they got swimming pools in hyde park .
reading other people ' s mail is not only impolite , it ' s illegal .
i was close to being scared that time .
i ' m going for fearsome here , but i just don ' t feel it . i think i ' m just coming off as annoying .
i can ' t do that , it ' s a rolex .
a what ?
<person> ?
of you ? never .
an invasion .
yes , sir . we can be sure we get all the missiles , and we remove <person> so this can never happen again .
i don ' t know , i ' m very confused right now .
did you ever find out what it wanted ?
i . in that small context i would have . i would have to say ' no . '
then you ' re saying there ' s no negligence , based on my question ?
that ' s reassuring .
<person> - the world is my office .
i ' m the villain . i thought it could be a little cleaner this time -- me in central america , him in new york .
that ' s pretty clean .
hell , no . there ' s no dent there .
oh , yes there is !
toon cops worked me over .
<person> , i ' ll say . they gave you a real toon-a-roo .
no it isn ' t ! you may have a bad sprain , but no bones are busted !
it ' s broken , sir . i can feel it .
<person> , i ' ve been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you ' re becoming the queen of hot and cold .
you ' d never understand .
it ' s the witch ! she ' s followed us here !
can ' t that female take no for an answer ?
<person> did that stint at the nut house -- leak his file to your friends at the times-
my friends would be more interested in this . <person> ' s preliminary : white paint chips found embedded in sanderline <person> ' s scalp . a matching dent on the white window sill . i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time <person> flew out of it . it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd .
another shot , another bud .
no . this is on the house .
so , when i ' m seventeen , can i turn everyone ' s life upside-down , behave like a total piece of canine excrement , and then wipe the slate clean with a half-baked apology and a kodak moment ?
no !
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
it means you ' re too hard on guys .
sheeni ? how are you ?
i ' m well , <person>ie .
<person> , <person> !
say hello to the pacific for me .
<person> morning .
you didn ' t have to .
i can ' t understand you .
confounded radio in this thing .
may i respond ? first of all , i don ' t appreciate being spoken to with that kind of language . that ' s not the way i talk to you , and i ' d appreciate it if you wouldn ' t talk that way to me --
well --
we ' re just trying to sneak a peak .
just stay off the property until i ' m off the phone .
ouch . how many ?
dozens . it ' s very sad .
. go ahead . hit the driver .
i changed my mind . gim me the three wood .
it ' s probably just some weirdo . the city ' s full of them . believe it or not , we get reports like this every night . it ' s nothing to worry about .
oh .
yeah .
what have you got ?
i didn ' t know he was going to make that announcement , i swear i didn ' t .
i know you didn ' t .
<person> ?
hello , <person> ? how ' s it going ? i got it , dad ! <person> ! <person> ! my father ' s in one of his moods again . <person> menopause , you know . so how are you ?
oh , how ya doin ' , <person> ?
were you scared ? tell me honestly .
what ? !
people are miserable all over the world and you ' re killing yourself ? you should be ashamed .
do the <person> live beneath the earth ? why must you obey their command ?
they give us the food we eat , the clothes we wear . we must do as they command .
<person> .
<person> , this is an elementary school .
i ' m not so sure of anything as you are , <person> . you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough . just as i could live yours !
oh , come on , rachel . no way .
but don ' t worry . we ' ll be in heaven . the real heaven , i mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .
if you ' re anything like yours truly , then you probably figure we didn ' t want you when you were born , so who cares if we ' re dead ? am i right ?
because i can ' t think straight most of the time .
we can increase your medication .
but if we hit the road now we ' ll be five hundred miles away before they find him . we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin ' in the atlantic . just like you promised .
we got ta take care of her . when she gone . the problem gone . <person> ? we ' ll head off then , <person> , just like i said .
god . i ' m beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system . <person> ' t you folks talk to one another . that ' s her trailer there and i haven ' t touched a god damn thing . <person> <person> desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy <person> ' s trailer . which i showed him . i went back to my trailer . after that i never saw him again .
thank you , <person> .
you don ' t want to be at crossroads without one . it ' s a charm that old people teach you how to make . i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child . in my travels i misplaced it . i have been looking over my shoulder ever since .
i thought you weren ' t old fashioned .
no ! <person> , that i am ! i should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off , as long as . cu -- dorothy reacts -- speaks -- witch o . s .
what are you gon na do ? cu - witch looks up o . s . - speaks -
if i ' m not strong enough to be your apprentice , how can i do this ?
you ' re strong enough . but you ' re going to need courage , <person> .
as much as <person> ?
i don ' t know ! yes , yes , as much as <person> -- more than <person> !
well , the night is young . did you straighten out the chair situation ?
i ' m working on it , i ' ve made three calls . i can ' t stop thinking about how much i love you .
he ' s taking her to miami for the fucking doral ! how am i supposed to compete with that ?
man , you are having a bad week .
tell them what ? ! what , thelma ? what do you think we should tell them ?
i don ' t know . just tell ' em what happened .
who else knows ?
just us .
i think you ' ve got some issues to deal with . really , when we get out of here i ' m pretty sure it ' s shrink time for you .
just listen to me ! i ' ve been doing some reading . in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks . it became part of the ottoman empire . when the turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards . they buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle boxes . i read about this , man . i read about it .
he didn ' t figure on all the stink this is causin ' . <person> be he ' s lookin ' to strike a bargain . if so , he probably figures he needs somebody like me who talks his language . could be we got him .
i don ' t like it .
very ambitious . i like that .
the thing is , i ' ll need a first mate .
<person> bond to see <person> .
yes . i ' m to bring you right up . the valet will take your car -
a real fireball .
you know carpentry ?
not much of a pass .
probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here . worn down to nothing now .
whatll it be ? the regular ? <person> ?
set one up .
four men , maybe five . and a child -- or a small women maybe .
<person> .
what did ya do ?
i ' m a robber .
i never saw it before .
do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire ? no , i suppose you don ' t . the next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel . do you know what that is ? i ' m sorry i was angry with your people . i had no right to be . no more than if i had visited the island of bali in my own time . you were safe inside your great house , yet you came out into the night to warn me . the one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice . you have that quality , <person> . i ' m sure all of your people have it . all it requires is someone to reawaken it . i shall try if you ' ll let me . will you ?
but you just said it hasn ' t really moved .
that ' s correct .
uh - now , please don ' t be angry with me . i ' ll - i ' ll do anything you say , only . only if you don ' t shout at me . it makes me nervous !
it makes you nervous ?
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away .
what do you mean ?
you know <person> and i are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother .
you are very sweet , but <person> has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him . he has a policy .
. <person> , and we ' re working on some other interesting stuff .
. a cosmetics company by any chance ? what are you , the <number> th man on the deal team ? the last to know ?
we have to think this through . we have to be smart . now is not the time to panic . if we panic now , we ' re done for . <person> saw it . <person> knows it was us . we ' re still okay . now all we have to do is just figure out our next move .
our next move ? i ' ll say one thing , <person> . this is some vacation . i sure am having a good time . this is real fun .
<person> . well , see , it ' s not really up to me . it ' s not my car . <person> , we ' ll have to ask my friend , but she ' ll probably say no . she ' s a little uptight .
well . maybe we better not ask her . but thank you anyway .
<person> , it ' s rather simple . those risks that you love to take on the golf course , the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about -- you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion .
i should ask this woman out .
<person> hold me .
how do you know <person> ?
it has to surface to release the nerve agent , right ?
by then it ' s too late ! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water ! the chemicals will break down and dissipate !
i know he ' s around here someplace .
what say we get outta here and go crush a bucket ?
lion , darling -- i knew you ' d come !
<person> !
oh , i don ' t know . i think proms are pretty dumb .
' <person> thought maybe you and i could go if you weren ' t already taking someone .
stand or split them .
surely you believe in living dangerously .
<person> , now who is that ?
one lousy letter eighteen months ago . i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way .
still , that ' s hard to take , goddam it !
was it in the diaper , or not ?
you know where he is .
wrong .
you don ' t understand what i mean by the river .
we ' re talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons , <person> , that human frailty you like to blather about , not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit .
. if you showed sufficient . willpower . promised to slow down . <person> out running , jumping . shooting . all kinds of . and he pulls her toward him , they kiss .
strenuous activity ?
my turn . when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it ?
that ' s not the game .
we had a run-in , he and i . he knew about us , he knew about my shoulder , he knew exactly where to hurt me . <person> stands . she begins to tremble .
are you saying . <person> is the man who ' s trying to kill me ?
i ' m busted up for you , but <person> , what the hell are you doing ? those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn ' t lift a finger .
no , i guess i ' ve been no help at all to you .
<person> , wake up . as your friend , i think you should see what you did to <person> . the press won ' t get hold of this if you get . away quickly .
this is <person> . that ' s not <person> . this is <person> . i didn ' t do that do that to her . <person> , someone ' s setting me up .
yes . <person> ?
what ?
you admit you ' re lying ?
i admit i don ' t know where he is .
your honor , it has come to our attention that your honor , while in private practice , previously represented the town of seal beach in their stop-work suit against the police department of seal beach . we believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case and we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is investigated .
mr . <person> , this is a most unusual motion .
sure you do , it ' s good for you .
where ' s <person> ?
you ' ve got this wrong . you ' re not under arrest , you ' ve been abducted . and until i say different , you belong to me .
is that a fact ?
what ' s this guy ' s problem ?
just go around him .
you can still hear me . canandiacute ; t you . <person> lies still . cyclops i want to thank you for taking me in . taking us in . you have taught me everything in my life that is worth knowing . <person> grimly regards <person> . cyclops and i want you to know that iandiacute ; ll take care of them . <continued_utterance> hey . iandiacute ; m sorry . about <person> . i was jealous .
well , i think thatandiacute ; s perfectly understandable .
the ' local ' mayor ' s ' local ' daughter .
thing is , the net in the basket isn ' t very comfortable , so tod-o wraps them up in the jib . after the deed was done .
i guess i started smokin when i was about six . my mama was already dead from lung cancer .
what brandd she smoke ?
you ' re not from around here , are you ?
oz .
well , you know . they ' re all coming out of the woodwork now .
who is ?
i ' m sorry . i didn ' t mean that . where are you going ?
do out there , what you did in here .
is this paper even good ?
check the scrawl .
i asked what , not who .
he ' s going to help out in the menagerie .
whhhooops ! ha-ha -- there goes some of me again !
oh -- does it hurt you ?
hey , parker .
how ' s your pulse ?
who are you talking about ?
wild kids we used to know .
how come it ' s still smoking ?
started up again . kids .
what is her disposition ?
regarding what ?
according to your statement you are a short-con operator . run of the mill seams . everything you do , you learned from somebody else .
that ' s been suppressed . anything in there is inadmissible .
just take her to court , you ' ll kill her .
i can ' t .
what is it ?
a menorah .
i don ' t know . i want to see you .
kelly . <person> . take one of your mom ' s valium or something . in another week you get on the plane . it ' s over . we ' re rich .
you know a dealer named <person> , <person> ?
you know a religious guy named <person> ?
hold her . hold her , goddamn it !
i can ' t hold her . this kid ' s out of control here !
iandiacute ; ll tell you one thing though .
whatandiacute ; s that ?
somewhere safe .
where ?
what are you doing ?
counting the gray hairs in your head .
no .
you leave me no alternative . <continued_utterance> cut her anchor .
you know what i ' m doing with my half ?
third . what you ' re going to do with your third .
guilty .
on the deck of the yankee , the night you asked me to marry you . we weren ' t much older than they are .
no . <person> , and we ' re going to see that it is not .
so what i want to do is stop it here . i ' m going to make him an offer . i want to do it myself . i want it to come from me .
we did .
it ' s just us now .
you can do this . <continued_utterance> i want to hear you say it .
i can do this .
and then you quietly port into all the other pods and spread the infection to them .
oh , <person> !
<person> or not , if <person> ' s alive he ' ll never come up again .
i ' <number> find him .
he never came .
he stood you up ?
what ?
good afternoon . i ' m <person> , from the second mommy agency .
-- well , maybe two-seventeen .
you ' re trying to tell me you can read all that from a track ?
then get the cotton yourself if you don ' t want me to let go of her !
take the towels off -- they ' re full of shit .
. sure and we ' ll own the airline . if he makes anybody rich , let him make himself rich , so ' s he can pay off his school loans .
. nice to see you in such a good mood <person> , what ' d mom do , give you fish for dinner ? . you ' re smoking too much , how many times do you got ta go to the hospital to .
oh .
have you tried whistling ?
drop it , i said . it ' s over .
. we need more charcoal .
well , i ' m sure with the proper guidance he ' ll be fine . grady tries to read <person> ' s face -- -is he messing with
what made you pull out that old thing ?
no . for gods sakes , <person> !
well , like kill him with the atomic bomb ?
this song sucks .
<person> picked it . he ' s an odd one .
hold it . not so fast .
oh , god . i hope i ' m not too late .
what ?
do you still love your husband ?
<person> , mr . <person> ?
not really .
hello , christina . it ' s a beautiful day . <person> ' t it the most beautiful day ?
i guess . <person> , sure .
what about the future ? you planning to rock the boat at all ? stir things up in `` heaven ? ''
matter of fact , <person> , my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine . to expand the traditional western notions of `` beauty . ``
and you ' re old .
ouch . how many ?
<person> ? what the hell you doing back already ?
<person> , get out ! get up on your roof or someplace ! we found out what ' s been killing people ! they ' re under the ground !
<person> ? have you been ?
not in months . i don ' t even know why i bought the damn place .
sort of a day office . come on -
i ' m not going in there .
you seem fine now .
<person> ! you ' re going to believe that fat dweeb mr . <person> over your own daughter .
<person> and <person> ' s place is closer . <person> ' s do their kitchen today . do <person> tomorrow .
<person> ' s out of town tomorrow . we don ' t dig today . we don ' t get paid today . damn it , <person> , you never plan ahead . you never take the long view . <person> , here it is monday and i ' m already working on wednesday . it is monday , right ?
i like it .
<person> , whoa , whoa .
i will be the judge of what is best . for me , and for france .
of course . forgive me .
oh , look . the sailors are here .
<person> rid of them !
you forget about your troubles . you give up your worries . you drink from the wellspring of relaxation that enriches your soul . now i can ' t , at this time , give you the kind of therapeutic attention that you need to solve all your problems . know why ?
er , because you ' re on vacation ?
what ? ! <person> officer ? you mean you ' re a criminal ?
well , not anymore , thelma , except for bustin ' parole , i haven ' t done one wrong thing .
that ' s my fault , not hers . i ' ve got to keep practicing . i ' m still in the learning stage but magic , madmartigan , requires concentration and --
watch it !
you ' ve been living here since you were nine ? i should look into that . how do you get to be a eunuch ?
they cut off your testicles .
is there any reason to believe they ' ve left the state ?
that ' s certainly possible .
you heard me , <person> .
<person> , you don ' t understand-
is this the chiefs ' recommendation ?
yes , sir . our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational . the invasion happens eight days later .
. is accusing me of rape . <person> told me . apparently i ' m the last to know .
<person> . i . <person> ' s been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long . she ' s pushing for suspension .
<person> bites man . <person> bites dog is a news story . riots at the world cup soccer finals is a social announcement . next ?
this just came in : there ' s something up with the british navy in the strait . rescue planes , helicopters ; two ships supposedly sailing from the persian gulf . they just chased away one of our news boats .
really ? you ' re son quit ?
my step son and yes . <person> ' t get me started , i thought becoming a coach might be a nice way for us to bond . he said it wasn ' t fierce and he quit .
fuck you , <person> . you ' re paying me to write my novel , so you own me .
i don ' t own you . you ' re brilliant , you ' re good-looking , you ' re handsome .
americans ? journalists ?
yes .
take a look at this . <person> and i found it under <person> ' ring fingernail .
and no one found the ring ?
you should not be smokin if youre pregnant . <person> smart .
who says im smart ? you up to somethin with <person> peru , <person> ?
<person> , it was over a year ago .
what ' s wrong with me ?
i ' d rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble . ' course these days i don ' t have to worry about that . my husband got laid off at the mill , and they repossessed the car , so wherever i wan na go , i just have to hoof it , you know ?
you don ' t have a car ? you want this one ?
detective duquette , ms . <person> . let me in . now . <continued_utterance> where is she ?
where she lives . in the guest house .
i think i made it plain that the court intends to near <person> ' s story .
i ' m sorry .
you ' re telling me you don ' t get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts .
you ' ve seen one naked breast , you ' ve seem them all .
senator . <person> ?
yes . who are you ?
soviet sb- <number> nuclear torpedo . <person> , one kiloton .
will the cruise set it off ?
and the horse you rode in on , <person> . light it up .
well , i ' m not going to let this happen . <continued_utterance> i just can ' t believe it . we ' re going to go down as the biggest bunch of assholes in history .
you always get like this when you smoke .
no . last night i couldn ' t sleep , so i just laid there looking up at the sky , counting the stars . there were over seventy . <person> makes you think , doesn ' t it ?
buzzing ?
<person> . i got some kind of buzzing . like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull .
you interested in some slaves ? <continued_utterance> you have money ?
well , that depends on what you mean by money ?
can i come in ?
who are you ?
right , <person> . we ' ll be in touch .
that was really something . that dancing girl . what did it mean ?
oh . now she ' s starting . how do they know ?
they know . it ' s the scent . we better split ' em up .
ok . so i have to ask , those tatoo ' s must have hurt , right ?
not really .
stop it !
i was just getting to the interesting part !
he ' s fine . not injured at all . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> a . <continued_utterance> <person> , my friend .
what happened ?
it broke my heart to see it .
and you became a musketeer .
how ' re you doing in there ?
fine .
here it come : one-two-
<person> , don ' t , <person> ! come on , <person> . never mind . he ' s drunk .
now that she ' s destitute --
thanks to you .
why didn ' t anybody tell me ? !
i don ' t set policy . you have the key ?
i ' m sorry i haven ' t always treated <person> the way -- i should have . she deserves better . <continued_utterance> i care for her .
i don ' t want to see her hurt .
i know this is a difficult situation and you ' re only doing your jobs . i don ' t bear you any ill-will , but i do have a small favor to ask .
you want to ask us a favor ?
oh , i ' d give anything to get out of oz altogether -- but which is the way back to kansas ? i can ' t go the way i came .
no -- that ' s true . the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself !
i had hopes for you .
like i ' d grow up to be president , another reagan .
the i . r . s . they need my furniture . they got some living room somewhere in this country that needs to be furnished .
they ' re taking the furniture ?
i don ' t have a cell .
how can you not have a cell ?
no .
what do you want ?
it has three bedrooms , one and a half baths . well , yes , that means two toilets and one bath . well . yes , by appointment . call me back if you decide . <continued_utterance> you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does <number> <number> / <number> baths mean .
will you still get the money from your father ?
his will .
now use it .
is this how you spend the money i pay you ? and with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men ?
<person> .
but you would have something to gain by killing <person> . and stopping his pipeline .
poor <person> . the cold war is over . what have you got left ? economic espionage . <person> in the boardroom . so dull .
meetin him at the gate . that phone call this afternoon was the signal . my deranged mamas hid the keys to my car . but of course , i know exactly where they are .
i didn't hate me so much , id feel better wishin you luck .
<person> away .
it ' s not that easy . maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . i can ' t . i don ' t want to be alone . i need to know i ' m going to be taken care of .
what ' s that ? what ' d he say ?
oh -- oh , come on .
it ' s what i didn ' t do .
<person> , i can imagine .
i was forced to hire a caddy for my loose change .
fore . !
you liked my piece . <person> , i ' m flattered . you know you write these things and you think someone ' s going to mention them and then the whole week goes by and the phone doesn ' t ring , and you think oh , <person> , i ' m a fraud , a failure --
you know what ' s always fascinated me about <person> and <person> is how old they looked when they were really just our age . <continued_utterance> i ' m so happy to have finally met you . we will talk . have you ever thought about doing a book ?
my god . the lightness .
what about me ?
<person> ' t get hurt .
<person> , i ' m a chicken , don ' t worry . <person> , listen to me .
my sword --
it ' s magnificent . where did you get it ?
is the war over ?
yes .
<person> for you . save it . now take this , it ' s too early to argue .
ok . <person> ' s go , pal .
no .
did you fight in vietnam ?
<person> for you to say .
what ' s that supposed to mean ? !
<person> .
what ?
yes ?
<person> , listen to me . where did you get this candy ?
but what am i gon na transform ? ?
me !
ride to calais and stop the cardinal ' s agent .
<person> . i can ' t .
that ' s a thick change of heart from this afternoon .
maybe i don ' t like being played , like she played us today . maybe i don ' t like that at all , jake . i ' m just pissed enough , maybe i ' ll rip the neck off my own grandmother .
are you kidding ? <person> and <person> discover i ' m gone and i ' ll be doing hard time .
are they okay ?
<person> . i liked what the old woman said about us earlier .
what did she say ?
six . six . six . six . i ' m thinking one . whose one ?
mr . motor .
all the rangers are on the lookout .
how much ?
give them to me !
no ! ! !
then why ' re you running outta here in the middle of the day without a word of explanation to me , <person> ?
brian , don ' t yell at me .
. i ' m sorry <person> .
i put you here . that powerhawk-
<person> ' t cry -- you ' ll rust yourself again !
comin ' to think of it , forty winks wouldn ' t be bad .
<person> , <person> , it ' s mr . <person> . what ' s going on over there ?
nothing ' s going on .
no .
she ' s blackmailing you , right ?
<person> , rhonda .
you ' re really leaving , huh ?
gruber .
<person> told him to call . ' he ' s some very hotshot surgeon at mass . commonwealth . he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of <person> . you meet him at the hospital . ' she hands him typed memo slip .
well , i never heard of him either . but this was one brave son-of-a- bitch . <person> for the confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another . then after the war he ran and won the governorship of louisiana -- twice !
he was a war hero .
i am just a middle man . i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner .
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss .
did you see his kids ?
no , they were asleep when i got here .
that is a load of shit . personal power has nothing to do with any of this . <person> has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this . well that ' s just more than the man deserves .
i think we should say some words over the grave .
so what are you gon na tell him ?
nothing . i ' m not gon na tell him a thing . the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is .
no choice , boss . it was him or you .
-- the vengeance you seek . and the salvation of <person> . are waiting for you in the crown of the sphinx . the oracle head lets out a long sigh and goes limp , a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth .
you meant it .
what makes you say that ?
i don ' t know anything about that .
well , call general mcaddie .
<person> , she ' ll manage .
now it ' s back to the good life for us !
<person> , do you love me ?
yes , i love you . i ' ve told you , but it doesn ' t really matter .
told you . i ' m red hot , i ' m <person> ' ! now , red seven . seven stinkin ' diamonds . look out ! five thousand ! let ' s go !
awful lot of money .
<person> ? ?
she left me . <person> .
<person> drop everything . do it now !
they want us to identify ourselves .
<person> , piss and moan -- i notice you ' re all jazzed up in new stuff .
they didn ' t have second-hand uniforms in my size .
<person> , that stuff about yourself was refreshingly honest . could we talk to you again in a few months to update your progress ?
sure . as long as my doctor gives permission .
scenic detour .
no way ! get back on the highway .
i know how you feel . i know you don ' t believe me , but i do . i ' m going to tell you something i learned when i was your age . i had prepared a case . mr . <person> asked me , ' how did you do . ' i said , ' i ' ve done my best . ' he said , ' they don ' t pay you to do your best . they pay you to win . ' that ' s what pays for this office . and that ' s what pays for the pro bono work that we do for the poor . and for the kind of law that you want to practice . and that ' s what pays for your clothes and my whiskey , and the leisure that we have to sit back and discuss philosophy . as we ' re doing tonight . we ' re paid to win the case .
<person> sitting across from him , impassive .
do not dishonor my father ' s name with your lies .
your father is a murderer and a thief . he stole what was ours , and left our world in ruins . we have the right to reclaim the casket .
i ' ve got my dr . <person> , says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway , plus she came in complaining of stomach pains .
. <person> ' s not bad .
now in <number> when you were running for vice-president .
i can ' t imagine your readers are interested in ancient history . <person> and i lost the election by a wide margin .
well , you ' ve already refinanced twice .
because you advised us to do that .
we ' re going to keep driving .
they ' ll shoot us !
m-o-o-om ? mom , have you seen my sally doll ?
what , dear ? what was that ?
<person> , dad .
you ' d tell me if there was something wrong , wouldn ' t you , pumpkin ?
<person> ' t you sweet to say so . i was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to -- oh !
easy there .
ski camp , seventh grade . <person> ' t make fun . what else do you have going on when you ' re thirteen ?
i ' m kinda not in the mood anymore .
the last one ?
yeah .
yes . it ' s good that someone can have the use of them . besides , in your clothes you ' d stand out to strangers . <continued_utterance> i should tell you these do not have buttons . <person> ? hooks and eyes .
something wrong with buttons ?
no hard liquor here . just beer . <continued_utterance> couple stars , <person> .
thought you said this was a private club . how come <person> allowed in without bein a member ?
that ' s awful generous of you . i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome .
one can tell you are from back home . these people nowadays don ' t know what manners are .
is there some reason why you ' re here ?
curiosity , i guess .
all his years at sea , he never stopped talking about these islands .
you miss him .
<person> ' s get something straight here , <person> . i ' ve been <number> years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away . i spent almost a year on <person> alone , with the trial , the testimonies , the background investigations . i didn ' t come here today to look in your goddamn folders . in fact , i wouldn ' t have come here at all if you ' d done your job right .
mr . <person> , this is a hospital , not a penitentiary . everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient ' s folder . whether you can make sense of it or not . <continued_utterance> <person> is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic . they see themselves as victims , and they always blame other people for the way they are . when <person> killed the mandrakis kids , it wasn ' t an act of hostility against the children but against their parents . he was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood . the criminal side of <person> is one of terrible , symbolic vengeance .
about what ?
every triangle i ' ve ever seen never lasts . somebody ' s got to go .
how are you value added ?
well first of all i ' m fun . no denying that . and secondly , unlike <person> , i actually used to wrestle .
that must be what we saw them doing !
`` . also killed was state <person> . continued on page seven . ``
why is that ?
look at me , dude , do i look like a fan of law enforcement ? forget the tests , you shoulda just asked me . i woulda saved you a lot of trouble .
really ?
i think so . maybe .
i have been charged with the dubious task of insuring your literary education . <continued_utterance> <person> is your first mate . but don ' t let his size fool you .
so when the hell do we get to meet <person> ?
how ' s that ?
different foods make for different dreams . i ' ve got a whole theory about it . it ' s called `` the <person> of <person> . `` you ' ll find it in the american medical journal under ' w ' . <person> and swiss cheese , for instance , you get a cool , thin , blonde girl . turkey sandwich , you get a dark sort of stumpy girl , sexy though . now a liverwurst sandwich - you get both girls at once . bad night .
i do apologize , sir . i heard a noise .
we were just --
this is great , dancing with the back of your head . <continued_utterance> if you got a problem with me , why are we dancing ?
<person> asked me to .
<person> .
<person> ! come sta , ragazzo ?
does she even know you ' re here ?
my mom ? she doesn ' t care about me .
yes i do ! aw <person> wait ! <person> ' t be sore ! i was having a little fun !
fun ! i could have lost my arm !
<person> through it ! laugh all you ' d like , mr . <person> - but you fit perfectly in to my plans . here . this just in . newsflash . read all about it .
. <person> destroyed by nuclear meltdown . british agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage ; <person> calls for british government to resign .
you drive a hard bargain , but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you .
i ' m not your boy . i don ' t like you . i got no choice but to do business with you . <person> ' s just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
say it again .
what ?
<person> dressed , <person> .
<person> -- what are you doing ?
you ' re not hanging round here all day .
i ' m not hanging . i ' m fixing my car --
you know <person> lied about how that boy <person> got kilt . and it was <person> who saw <person> last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog .
i remember <person> always trying to help someone . he got <person> ' s daughter out of trouble . he was always running to the store for someone who couldn ' t leave the house .
were you scared ? tell me honestly .
i was close to being scared that time .
like what ?
you know . things .
i told him i was in the bathroom and i ' d call him right back . what the hell was i supposed to say <person> , you got me into .
<person> , calm down ! it ' s not illegal to buy stock or to be right . and it ' s not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy . tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment .
<person> called . they're stayin another week .
stayin a few extra days in the big n . o . , huh ? this you ?
that ' s the point .
i don ' t get you , <person> .
<person> of some type . or some kind of strange alloy . and those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it .
so what do you make of it ?
when ?
you think it ' s funny ? me locked in ?
<person> , bless your bones . but the problem grows .
week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger . we can ' t feed all the hungry .
what ' s wrong , you don ' t like steak ?
i should be eating with the crew .
<person> , they ' re young . they ' re probably newlyweds .
i ' m telling you . there was something in her voice .
. and you ' re prepared to take these large salary cuts .
. we are . but we want a contract agreement -- iron-clad -- that if you buy it , you can ' t break it up .
your first step , sir , will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within <number> to <number> hours . they will refuse . when they do , you will order the strikes , followed by the invasion . they will resist , but will be overrun . they will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world , most likely <person> . we will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there , defeating them per our plans .
those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons . and what is the next step ?
is she alive ?
yes . <continued_utterance> i ' m quite prepared to tell you everything , though there isn ' t much you haven ' t guessed .
i thought maybe , <person> .
you hate gambling .
and some scotch , straight up .
now listen , guys , we got a problem here .
looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it .
but it would take an army of mechanics to do all that !
um . i ' m in the midst of a slight predicament .
what do you need ? money ?
it ' s a mine , isn ' t it ?
just relax .
no .
so you were alone .
yeah , i ' m out ! i ' m outta here ! maybe i ' ll crash and burn , but it ' s a chance , so i ' m gone ! i ' m history , histoire . <person> ' s gon na tell me what to do now , nobody . i ' m free as a bird . <person> nest . <person> on a june day !

the plane . it ' s all been arranged .
then you are completely unnecessary .
what the hell . ? <continued_utterance> help ! help me ! <continued_utterance> help me ! <continued_utterance> for <person> ' s <person> , <person> ! help me ! help me !
<person> . <person> !
a few weeks ago , the conditions at a garment factory on west <number> th <person> were brought to my attention . the owners claimed everything was satisfactory , but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection . <continued_utterance> it took awhile , but we finally got in .

<person> .

maybe i ' ll just go back to the hotel . it might just be too much for him tonight . i can see him tomorrow .
you sure ?
i talked to <person> at the bar association . the broad used to work for one of concannon ' s partners in new york awhile ago . she wanted to move to boston . how badly did she hurt us , <person> ?
i don ' t know .
`` terminator '' climbing claws . <continued_utterance> miniature power cams set in on contact , giving you a sure grip on any surface .
they come in any other styles or colors ?
louise !
what ? !
you can ' t let them stay over , man . you start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car . stop cuddling , <person> !
excuse me .
judy thinks my eyes are soulful . do you think my eyes are soulful ?

where ?
all right .
you gon na call tonight ?
i could , but it ' s confidential . <person> , the point is , we didn ' t talk . i told her this was not an appropriate time or place .
and she began to cry . and you put an arm around her .
why are you still hanging around ? your business is finished , you should go home .
i was invited . what ' s your story ?
maybe you ' re not supposed to . <continued_utterance> i might kiss you .
i might do it wrong .
what kind of ideas ?
well . for one thing . i think it ' s despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of `` classic beauty . ``
my friends , have you forgotten all that we ' ve done together ? <continued_utterance> who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of yggdrasil ?
you did .

why ' s that ?
<person> ' <person> ! now stop this . <person> .
i need to talk to you .
back away ? you want me to back away ? i ' ll back away .
you ' re a fucking lunatic !
is this dr . <person> ' s residence ?
you got some kind of business with him ?
his address . no , no , no . he would never do anything that prosaic . on <person> , looking a little wounded . kathleen the only thing i really care about besides the married thing . and the jail thing . is the boat thing .
the boat thing ?
you are ! oh , i beg your pardon ! but i ' ve never heard of a beautiful . mcu -- glinda looks to r . f . g . and speaks -- dorothy o . s .
only bad witches are ugly . <continued_utterance> the <person> are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east .
i don ' t know . there ' s two different opinions on this one .
what are you going to do ?
i should be eating with the crew .
humor me . eat it anyway .
in fact , you ' ve just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . you ' ve just sworn to that . <person> ' t that right ?
yes .
what do you mean ?
it had a very strong , very real anti-game theme . i mean , it began with the assassination of a game designer .
oh . well i am .
hm ?
i ' m not a stalker ! she ' s a friend of mine .
sure she is . that ' s why she got an unlisted number and you haven ' t heard squat from her in a dozen years . oh you ' re good , ted . you ' re a real piece of work .
red hot . her thighs steam .
<person> . she ' s pretty good in bed , then ?
why ' d you jump ?
because i felt like it . what do you care ?
judge <person> , it ' s an honor to handle it for you . consider it gone away . she ' s a minor ; it probably would ' ve expunged on her <number> th birthday anyway .
still , this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally .
got lucky out there .
great start , simmsy .
she needs to be changed again .
who is that horrible friend of yours ?
it ' s my father . he gets it from his doctor .
<person> ?
wan na fool around ?
yup .
uh , yeah .
my name ' s bernice . <person> .
you know i prefer wine .
<person> ' t go away . <continued_utterance> may i recommend this find cabernet ?
what ?
bet the bureau ' s accusing you of the same thing in dallas .
i keep racking my brain . i got ta find a way to really get even with this guy . it isn ' t enough to wreck his car . even breaking into his house and messing it up or something , that don ' t have enough impact . i mean , the man poked my wife ! i got ta come up with something ingenious . something ingenious .
so , what do ya think ?
what do you mean ?
there is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside . thousands of life forms all screaming me me me and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms . it ' s terrifying and exhausting .
so they see your house , and another one done with aluminum siding . the other house looking so much more beautiful .
in <person> ?
but i didn ' t bring anything .
ah , <person> .
what is it you want me to do ?
not here . i ' ll call you and we ' ll rendezvous again . we have to leave separately , so we aren ' t seen together . for your safety .
<person> believes it can happen to them .
it can ' t be .
can ' t a man enjoy himself on vacation ?
<person> -- ?
so i assume we ' re regarding this as just a kind of interlude .
<person> , it ' s too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i can ' t go <person> and i can ' t sneak , feel back enough as it is .
before you do me in , you will let me finish my business with ms . <person> first , won ' t you ?
what did you say ?
carly , get out of the hand . i ' m holding serious cards . <person> serious cards .
he ' s bluffing .
nope .
how ?
i got greedy . i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off . that was my mistake . <person> would never be so stupid .
he hired you . that was a mistake .
<person> . having sex with her is like reading the wall street journal ' cept the journal don ' t talk back . ' sides this aids crap is ruining romance , nobody trusts anybody anymore , got ta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together , somebody oughtta invent an aids dipstick , no kidding , make a fortune . i got ta get to work . z ' s today . the pool secretary , gina , calls out .
call for you <person>dy .
hi , <person> . nice to meet you .
she ' s very cute .
i can ' t believe your dad built this for you .
he didn ' t . he had it built .

would you please let me --
-- what happened ? !
take this to check in . i ' ll be right there .
<person> this sucker , eh ?
well , it ' s a lot better than all this `` why do you think you ' re in this situation '' psychological bullshit you hear all the time .
well . why do you think you ' re in this situation ?
<number> , <number> . no .
and you moved to new york . to dance and paint and act and deal arms .
i do not intend to be party to my brother ' s absurdities . he has allowed you in and drugged my parents .
i think they are deriving some good from the experience .
fine .
how ' s things , brian ?
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth , nineteen seventy .
. i was one of a group of .
dr . <person> , i ' m not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide . i don ' t believe in the elders of zion , the knights templar , the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
i don ' t either , but it sure sells books . <continued_utterance> i was right about <person> . <person> ' t i , <person> ?
my ex-husband was a lawyer .
really . how wonderful for you .
come on , get on the board and let ' s see your approach .
my approach is to be suave and debonair and sophisticated .
m-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i . you can almost hear that jazz blowin up from the big n . o .
<person> . i learned somethin interestin today on a science show i heard on the radio . how leeches is comin back into style .
that <person> was working on . yeah . he thought <person> needed some help , so they bribed a juror . so <person> finds out . he comes to me in tears . he thinks that anybody who knows what a ' spinnaker ' is got to be a saint . i told him ' <person> , wake up . these people are sharks . what do you think they got so rich from ? doing good ? ' he can ' t be comforted . he tells the boys at <person> and <person> they ' ve disappointed him , he ' s going to the judge to rat them out .
huh .
come on , we ' re not about pickin ' fights . <person> gon na keep a little order , that ' s all .
<person> ?
this is <person> . get every able body you can to dodger <person> -- j section .
what the hell ' s going on ?
you loaded the songs . you tell me ?
must be a mistake .
look : i ' m tryin ' to be polite . so would you just take off ? it ' s ok : just take off .
i just wan na --
relax . they only come out at night .
this is not going well .
the world is a big , beautiful place . we can open new markets in africa and asia . imagine the dali lhama reading our magazine .
in other words , our scope is too narrow .
<person> .
august ! <person> ! she was good ! she came back on her own ! besides , you can ' t do anything now ! the show is still going on .
almost . <person> to sit up ? what ' s the matter ?
nothing . i think i twisted my -- <continued_utterance> i have to tell you something . something . . hard .
the leaves .
incredible . we should take a drive before they ' re gone . spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast .
we ' ve still got some dead weight to get rid of .
<person> ' t we just dump him fast someplace ?
i take him back with me , yeah ?
since i supplied the cutters , the horse is mine . this is fair , no ?
-- they ' re asking her for a narrative . they want to know why she was in the wrong building .
she was with me .
think of it as a rite of passage to manhood .
like one of those `` national geographic '' specials with the topless chicks ?
you played pool for me ?
<person> , i had no choice .
what ' s his name ?
trent preston .
she is . i knew she would be . she had to be .
she looks . i would say she has a little of the coloring of that <person> person .
barely !
getting back will therapeutic .
<person> , didn ' t you used to be <person> ?
mr . <person> ?
i brought your coffee . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry . i didn ' t mean it that way .
it ' s okay . <continued_utterance> what ' s so funny ?
well , it has to do with time .
i ' ve always maintained what this nation needs is a reliable timepiece . the navy needs one . the army needs one . - for the artillery you know . kemp couldn ' t do better , <person> . so that ' s why you ' ve been in hiding . - clever of you , indeed ! filby i don ' t believe <person> is referring to a new kind of timepiece .
you know what i ' d really like ?
what ?
if he doesn ' t like it , we can make an exception just this once . we ' ll call him `` <person> '' .
up yours .
you may have many talents , my young friend . but guile is not one of them . <person>o you have a name ?
<person> ' <person> .
<person> . <person> , right ?
gave all that up . going into business .
i mean they didn ' t tell us what it ' s supposed to be about . they said do whatever you want .
so what ' s wrong with that ?
uh-huh .
the lazy fuck just didn ' t bother to look her up .
is everything alright ? <continued_utterance> <person> ?
i ' m not . <continued_utterance> he ' s so . it ' s too much . and i can ' t . i can ' t breath .
but i remember it ! all of it ! . <person> !
all implanted .
your husband ?
yes . i ' m sure he ' s hoping you ' ll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace .
you never were a team player . that ' s why you never had any friends .
i have plenty of friends .
oh , <person> farragut . <person> you trust your very own <person> ?
<person> , sweetheart . <person> in love with you like i am brings out that ugly jealous side .
hold the fuckin ' phone . you and <person> ? no , no , no . mcmanus guys , come on . <continued_utterance> i ' m sure you can understand my hesitation .
then who goes ?
where -- what -- are we -- ?
stand right here .
you haven ' t answered the question .
well . i ' d like to think that love is a question of destiny , not chance .
they ' ll shoot us !
we run they ' ll shoot us anyway . if we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; iraqis . or even if they know we ' re americans they might get scared , think we ' re part of a detachment and keep on going .
mr . president , i believe it is the only course of action . american is in danger . those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent . without our deterrent , there ' s nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war . it ' s our duty , our responsibility to the american people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation . the big red dog is digging in our back yard , and we ' re justified in shooting him .
<person> , we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational . the other options . <continued_utterance> . do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee . however , the more time that goes by , the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes .
give me the valium .
he just had two .
i never miss florida in the rainy season .
no letter ? no wire ?
it ' s going to be fine , you ' ll see .
i already called pomeranz and switched it to wednesday .
my fault ? ! if you hadn ' t pushed me out of the window in the first place --
oh , yeah ? well , if you hadn ' t shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
did i ?
yes . now i talked to <person> and there ' s a guy , this pakistani guy down in <person> .
we ' re supposed to be honest .
<person> and <person> . that ' s very interesting .
<person> --

you sound funny . did you do cocaine ?
no . no . i ' ll see you in about four hours .
you guys are my parents .
of course we are .
try to be . it ' s tough going with the crap they make today . if <continued_utterance> no . but the boston globe critic <person> hated it .

you weren ' t there , you don ' t know what happened .
i know enough .
<person> , about the divorce . do you want to file , or should i file ?
i got to be frank with you , this guy is nuts .
only if he can be trusted .
he ' ll do what i say .
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply ?
get your gear on .
i ' ve destroyed demons and monsters , devastated whole worlds , laid waste to mighty kingdoms , and still you worry for me ?

alright , i ' ll tell you what . you want the commission ? you can have it . and you don ' t even have to take <person> . i ' ll take care of him for free and i ' ll send you the check every month . on one condition .
and what are you ? a cop ?

correct . i don ' t .
i don ' t know nothin ' . not about the sphinx . that ' s out of the ball park .
i have to get there . can ' t you help me ?
it ' s a simple blood typing test . this thing ' s blood chemistry is different than ours . basically we mix someone ' s blood with uncontaminated human blood . if we don ' t get the proper serum reaction -- then that person isn ' t human .
<person> uncontaminated blood we going to use ?

i can ' t arrest him . but i have called the santa cruz police . they are on their way here now .
well , i shall be going now . please continue without me .
it ' s none of your businesz who sent us . we ' re here , and that ' s all that matters . <continued_utterance> oh god , what happened ? i didn ' t mean to say that !
it ' s your character who said it . it ' s a kind of schizophrenic feeling , isn ' t it ? but you ' ll get used to it . there are things that have to be said to advance the plot and establish the characters , and those things get said whether you want to say them or not . <person> ' t fight it . just go with it .
well , to be honest , the idea of getting old with <person> was kinda startin ' to get to me .

we owe him that ! he got you started in this business . he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures . before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies -- like price ! he took care of you before you were hot ! silence . she ' s hitting home but he doesn ' t want to acknowledge it .
he wouldn ' t understand .
did he say anything about me ?

it ' s none of your fucking business , <person> .
its a problm i dont thinks gon na go away too soon though . <person> , im thinkin of breakin parole and takin you out to sunny california .

but i thought --
we ' re going to buy a boat of our own baby , and sail it wherever we want to go .
some reformed spic dope dealers that normally dabble in reefer . <continued_utterance> seized from <person> . thirty pounds . the city is cracking down on the dreaded to make room for their beloved dodgers . they remove the mexicans , we remove the rest .
why ? they could hawk heroin right along with peanuts and hot dogs . have the whole bleacher section goofing on horse .
is some higher force at work , here ? are we asking too much of life ?
those assholes are supposed to be <continued_utterance> <person> ! i don ' t <continued_utterance> i am not !
keep it .
what do you mean ? isn ' t that how ride-sharing works ? -- we split everything fifty-fifty ?
how did you survive ?
i used my body on the guards . it gave me control . i got to a gun and i took my chance . i ' ve never told anyone that . <continued_utterance> do you ever stop , <person> ? do you ever think about . another kind of life ?
do you know how hard it is to pretend to be your `` buddy ? '' i love you , <person> . you fucked me four times in one night . you have been inside me and i have swallowed your come . that means something .
<person> .
you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose .
his leg is not good enough , sir .
<person> ?
you ' re on , caller . go ahead .
we thought maybe you ' d have that kind of information for us .
this is a very different proposition .
and what do you do when you wake up to that ?
i feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble . he stares right at magneto .
why is he working so hard to hide it ?
he doesn ' t have a choice .
we ' re going for the stronghold .
<person> . can you hear me ? you are fucked . there ' s no way out of this . if you won ' t listen to your own laws , then listen to this : this is president <person> . this nation does not want your sympathy . you can not use this reservation as a sanctuary . stop where you are now . <continued_utterance> whatever you are trying to do is futile , <person>mond . you have nothing . nothing . <person> picks up the mic as he cranes to keep an eye on the rearview .
i ' ll bet . who made the call ?
some old broad heard an `argument ' and buzzed <person> .
she ' s at the window .
yeah .
lets get ahold a her quick .
you think shes gon na make it ?
you love me ? <continued_utterance> will you do something for me ?
landon . i can ' t even do for myself .
i know .
you need to see a doctor , mr . <person> . an internist . and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist , as well .
getting back will therapeutic .
<person> just talk to me . just a little talk .
i ' m not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around . i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don ' t have the stomach to do what has to be done .
i ' ve got no stomach for murder .
can you see me ?
yes .
i ' m no expert , but it seems to me that the `pursuit of a person ' s mythic destiny ' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do .
i ' m stuck . <person> . my life ' s a plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker with a tight pin position on a green with a stimp meter reading of thirteen . i need help . i need advice . i need counsel . i need a shrink .
. he doesn ' t talk to me , maybe not to anyone , except <person> .
<person> in his car in the driveway .

<person> . and when your friend crabtree gets done with him , he ' s going to be even more disturbed .
i ' m not sure that ' s possible .
i have only one concern . <continued_utterance> you do like girls , don ' t you ?
of course i like girls .
absolutely . but can it wait ? i ' m on a critical surveillance right now .
<person> . is there anything you want to tell me ?
what happened ?
lying bastard . lied to my face .
that ' s not blood . that ' s ink . that goof <person> squirted me with some the other day . why it ' s comin ' ' through now , i don ' t know .
that ' s because it ' s disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up three days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn ' t punch you in the nose . great gag .
the tv didn ' t work .
what hotel are you staying at ?
. as far as being axed , i ' m still here and as long as i am , i have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members i represent .
your responsibility , dad , is to present the facts , not your opinions , to the men . you ' re gon na destroy their lives , dad ! <person> ' t do it to ' em . give it a chance . let the membership decide for themselves , dad . please .
ask me a question i would normally lie to .

what happened at <number> ?
i wasn ' t doing anything .
that ' s not the way it looked to me . <person> to me like you was trying to make time with her .
he ' s a foolish boy . and barely that .
that foolish boy is about to become a man . <person> is all the more reason for us to act . quickly .

hey , you know what ? can i be honest with you ? right now i ' m not all that interested in how you ' re messed up ' cause you didn ' t get the bicycle you wanted for your thirteenth birthday . what i ' m interested in is how i can keep from getting dead . and listening to sob stories from some about how the system wasn ' t good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of being born a kennedy doesn ' t do a damn thing to help keep me alive . so do me a favor ; either shut up , or . just shut up . <person> isn ' t sure what to say .
wait a minute . dr . <person> couldn ' t have had anything to do with <person> ' s death .

how ' s he going to want the gold ? he couldn ' t even know we had it .
i remember spring break of my senior year . <person> like a lifetime ago .
<person> , please .

<person> . whatever you say . i ' m crazy , i ' m blind .

the city ' s full of bad microwaves , bad thermals , bad electro-optics . you can ' t shield from it anymore . you can ' t get true readings . the whole industry moved out of the city years ago .
so you know your way around . we can hide out .
i think that about does it , spooky .

i can ' t believe you used to bring my daughter here , to this place .
hey man , back the fuck up . to this place . what ' s that shit ? right now , all over this country , a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see , you got any drugs ? you know where i can get drugs ? what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person , on their possibilities ? if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood , indian hills , and they asked every white person they saw , hey , you got any drugs ? , within a day , your friends and their kids would be selling . it ' s market forces , man . the product ' s marked up three hundred percent . you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day . you think white people would still be going to law school ?

<person> ' t know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
that ' s just mean . oh . <person> wanted to know if i could get her some .
<person> . so what ' s next ?
we ' re trying to figure out where he can wrestle ?
what a shame . you just missed him . <continued_utterance> turns back to bond . <person> . <continued_utterance> excuse me . she picks up a walkie-talkie , speaks into it : <continued_utterance> everything ' s under control up here . are you ready ?
yes . au revoir .
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club .
wow . <person> here just in time . i brought you this .
and then what ?
then you ' ll see who ' s really holding on to you .

that ' s considerate ! how ' d you arrange that ?
i ' m a taxpayer here ! you better go in and change , girls ! you haven ' t much time !
dad ? he grabs the rifle , but dad shoves him away .
<person> aside .
i ' m gon na just tell her i ' m waiting .
she ' s in there !
yeah . so ?
that ' s in two days .
then i guess <person> can kiss that arm of his goodbye . he don ' t use it for no good deeds anyway . <continued_utterance> you come all the way out here to watch <person> ?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
<person> saturday night we ' ll have a party . invite all our friends , sit out on the veranda and interview each other .
i ' ve done all that .
yes , we ' ve heard that . <person> : you testify quite a bit against other physicians ? isn ' t that right ? you , you ' re available for that ? when you ' re paid to be there ?
<person> . yes . when a thing is wrong . as in this case , i am available . i am seventy-four years old , i am not board-certified . <continued_utterance> i have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and i know when an injustice has been done .
who are you ?
well , i -- i -- i am the great and powerful -- <person> of oz .

all stop on the engine !
i caught him ! i caught him trying to steal the gold .

yes . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
i don ' t know . i have no idea .
hey ! i ' m ordering here . at least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast .
french toast and a cup of coffee .
i ' m not enrolling him . he ' s just here until we reach his mother and figure this out .
so he ' s got ta do something , right ? let him wrestle . <person> at this way , you ' re helping out the old man and this kid ' s a little bonus for doing the right thing .
that ' s not the question . it ' s over . do you think that it ' s my fault ? if i ' d . if i ' d . i never should have taken it . there was no way that i was going to win .
you ' re talking like a drunk .
i think i ' ll take some meatloaf .
meatloaf .

where ' s the family ?
the wife and daughter were in santa barbara . <person> got back .
<person> , well you ' re really gon na have some bad dreams if we find out you didn ' t .
that ' s enough .
bad break .
tough break . <continued_utterance> you lose .
you ' re going to settle out of court ?
yes .
tonight , it won ' t be me . no , for the test launch of existenz by <person> , we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special . <continued_utterance> yes , it is . the world ' s greatest game designer is here , in person , to lead you , the first test enclave , through her newest creation , existenz by <person> . <continued_utterance> i give you , the game-pod goddess herself - <person> !
the world of games is in a kind of a trance . people are programmed to accept so little , but the possibilities are so great . <continued_utterance> you probably thought that tonight , we were going to test a new game that i designed . <continued_utterance> but there is no new game to test , at least , not in the usual sense . <continued_utterance> no , no , it ' s going to be much better than you expected , because existenz is not just a game . it ' s an entirely new game system . <person> research and i developed it together - the existenz system by <person> - and it involves a whole lot of new toys , which you are going to be the first to try out .
do you know the reason why i try to recruit guys like you ? there ' s no risk . <continued_utterance> there ' s nobody back home who ' s gon na ask questions if you just . disappear for a while .

great job you got .
your new friends .
yeah . it should be fun . you wan na come ?
hey , <person> !
uh . hi , <person> . what are you doing here ?

<person> ' t say that . we don ' t know that for sure .
sure . sure i ' ve been there . they look at each other . <person> coughs again .
kind of a mean place to be . <person> cold , unfriendly .
did you do it ? he didn ' t do it .
he wrote obscene words on the wall .

he may be a soulless robot but he ' s a rich , happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who ' s got you by the huevos -- besides , how is getting into the u . s . open gon na change what she thinks about you ?
it ' ll prove to her that i ' m not who she thinks i am .
so why don ' t you tell me something about who you gather information for . they obviously have very deep pockets . are you from a rival clan ?
let ' s just say i ' m freelancing and leave it at that .
why do we sell at a lower cost ? so more people can buy books .
why couldn ' t she sell that way too ?
i came to get you , honey . and to see <person> . i missed you so much . can i have a hug , baby ?
where ' s he going ?

i ' ll just continue like you ' re both actually listening to me .

'
chief <person> , u . s . attorney <person> has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the federal grand jury on- -<person> , this brilliant rebuke:

mr . mcavoy , i can appreciate that you have a fairly laid-back , relaxed lifestyle -- but i have hours to keep .
into what ?
a new extraterrestrial biological entity .
<person> is shocked . he thought he had a free pass into the second round , but instead he ' s going home . he dominated the fight the entire way , but fell prey to a very technical finish .
<person> technical finish , but come on , that ' s a fluke .
they found her yesterday in a hotel in pennsylvania . shot twice in the head .
<person> .
not if there was just one day left on it .
why ?
what does that mean ?
like if something happened to him , he could still get us .

i don ' t know . i just want to get out of this town . and if you ' ve got any sense when you get old enough you ' ll get out of here too . your mom ' s gon na live in this town for the rest of her life , and you know why ? because she thinks she has to . <person> ' t ask me why , but that ' s the truth . she thinks there ' s all these things she has to do , but you want to know one thing about your mom ? she ' s a bigger fuck- up than i ever was . i mean , i know i messed up . you think i enjoy getting thrown in jail because i wanted you to face that prick your dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he is ? i know i got a little carried away , and i lost my temper just a little bit -- which is not the end of the world either , by the way , just for future reference -- and now she ' s kickin ' me out of my own house because -- you know , because i fucked up a little bit . which i totally admit . i was like -- totally ready to admit that .
what ' s that , <person> ? what ' s the bright side ?
well . at least now you know .
the others you round up and take to base camp - they will pull guns .
you ' ll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns .
<person> ! that ' s why the court exists . the court doesn ' t exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice .
and are they going to get it ?
i have an excellent teacher . ' make sure you wear the uniform ' ?
what do you make of all this ?
i won ' t calm down . i can ' t do this . we can ' t do this . it won ' t work . it will not work .
it has worked .
i ' m somewhat less so . we seem to have a bit of a problem .
i had to inspect the merchandise first .
-- you saw this experiment ?
what did it look like ? <continued_utterance> there were bees . and corn crops . <continued_utterance> what are they ?
you ' re welcome .
my men are dead , and i have no casket . you are a deceiver .
no , no , no . i don ' t mean the stuff about the peasants -- i mean the real stuff .
the `` real '' stuff ? . you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies ?
you ' re serious ?

. i ' m kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts . it ' s a long and worthy story but i won ' t trouble you with it right now .
are you expecting someone ?
it ' s a small price to pay .
i . i can ' t , <person> .
no , no , no , i ' ll be fine . i ' ll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning .
<person> , son , this ' ll only hurt for a second .
so what . ? the best is yet to come . check the tv guide . they got our dr . <person> on a panel on gbh on friday : ' the healing hand . the experts speak . '
they still have to take it to a jury .
why ?
because you ' re right . it ' s taken so many generations for your people to get to this point . you ' re nearly there . you just need someone to show you how close you really are . <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> . <continued_utterance> look -- your ancestors called it magic . you call it science . i come from a place where they ' re one and the same thing .
well , that ' s all you got ta say !
there is nothing wrong with the work i do here . i have been doing just fine , the whole time before you came here -- and if you think that riding people in this petty , ridiculous way is the way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else i think you ' re out of your mind !
nice to meet you .

<person> ' s be different --
i can ' t feel my hands . <continued_utterance> i ' m serious --

i don ' t know why they ' re after me , but what ' s your connection with all this ?
we were together before .
get out of town , <person> , as quick as you can .
<person> , i ' ve been fucked over too many times , by too many women . you ' re becoming the queen of hot and cold .

-- and this musician got onto the train -- <continued_utterance> -- and i suddenly saw him , sitting directly across from me doing the crossword puzzle .
how ' d you know it was him ?
of course i ' ve been thinking about it .
so . any decisions ? or -- do you still want to think about it some more . ?
you ' re going to stay in school .
why ? so i can wind up like you ? what ' s the point ?
all i ' m saying is if you need somebody to help you , i ' m happy to keep your boy warm for you .

i like your cheekbones . <person> , are you all right ?
then why aren ' t you testifying for their side ? <continued_utterance> i can subpoena you , you know . i can get you up there on the stand .
and ask me what ?
he ' s not going to tell the truth ! he was diving for the gold !
it seems - mr . <person> - that <person> has told me the most incredible story : a sunken british warship filled with gold ; a british cutter firing on her ; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the strait . <continued_utterance> obviously , the british government denies all of this -
who ' s your accountant , mister , ' cos i think you ' re down in the debit side .
who ' s stuck with my wife . you or me ?
that ' s not what i ' m sug --

how many can pay ?
fewer than half .
breakfast is getting cold .
thank you , dear .
oh yeah .
i told you to slow down . <person> , <person> , i told her to slow down .
i saw you speak at the legion hall in cleveland last spring .
for the league of <person> ?
betty - you really live that number .
the story of my life .
of course , dumpling . its very nice of <person> but .
<person> for <person> .
but , but . she changed your life .
yup . and now i ' m gon na change hers .
<person> gone off with <person> .
what do you want me to do about it ?
<person> ? <continued_utterance> is that you , homie ? <continued_utterance> i saw <person> , there in the brush .
what ?
it can ' t be .
<person> thing happened to me with wife two . i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty . i mean empty . she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge . what kind of person would think of that ?
we ain ' t buying that .
damn it , quit the bickering and give me a hand . wheel that fibrillator over here . <continued_utterance> palmer , turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face . childs , grab his shoulders .
<person> , we all set ?

<person> did your people get into <person> ?

i ' ll be around long after you ' re dead , <person> ! you slime ! when i get outa here i ' ll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole !
friend of yours ?
. i appreciate the chance you ' re giving me , mr . <person> , as the single largest stockholder in <person> , to speak . on the way here today i saw a bumper sticker . it said , `` life is a bitch . then you die '' . . well ladies and gentlemen , we ' re not here to indulge in fantasies , but in political and economic reality . america has become a second rate power . our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions . in the days of the ' free market ' when our country was a top industrial power , there was accountability to the shareholders . the carnegies , the mellons , the man who built this industrial empire , made sure of it because it was their money at stake . today management has no stake in the company . altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than <number> % and where does mr . <person> put his million dollar salary ? certainly not in <person> stock , he owns less than <number> % . you own <person> , the stockholders , and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches , golf and hunting trips , corporate jets , and golden parachutes ! <person> has <number> different vice presidents each earning over $ <number> , <number> a year . i spent two months analyzing what these guys did and i still can ' t figure it out . <person> is pissed .
this is an outrage <person> ! you ' re full of shit !
he said it was `` thor . ``
t-h-o-r . and your relationship to him ?
go ahead . give me an excuse to fill you full of holes , pump you full of lead . how ' m i doin ' , <person> ?
real good , <person> . but maybe you better let me take over .
why did you forget the tent check ?
i didn ' t mean to liz . i ' m sorry .
ah . no .
maybe a road or route number ?
well , i know you ' re busy
<person> ' t play games with me , ted .
where we going ?
to pick up <person> .
hey , i know you , man . <continued_utterance> you were in the diner with that hot girl . <continued_utterance> i wouldn ' t mind her doing a little research on me .
i have no quarrel with you . but she ' s a lady . you should be more respectful .
oh shit !
yeah . yeah . what about the hor . ?
i got a blind caddie . just hold the stick , <person> -- and be sure to pull it out .
. when the going gets tough , the , the , the , whirrrrrrrrrrr , the , the .
that ' s it ! the sorceress lives there !
are you sure ?
you know how important this is to my mother . you know that .
i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry i forgot the tent . i don ' t think i forgot anything else .
his parents .
<person> . <person> ' s go rescue him .
to take a piss .
really ?
<person> , hey -- wait a minute . being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger .
<person> , right .
speaking of tappy heads , we ought to have an old fashion fish fry .
i don ' t have too many fish fries left .
no . <person> , you don ' t understand .
trust me , i understand . i just want to say something to you , <person> .
it ' ll work faster if i have an account number .
you ' ll have forty-eight hours to complete the transfer . <person> ' t waste our time .
that guy ' s starting another fund ?
yeah . he ' s an animal . he prints money . come on , let ' s finish strong .
if he ' s alive , bring him to me . if he ' s dead , have him <person> ' d at the morgue until <person> can be drawn off and this fbi situation sorted out .
<person> . he was operating hector-
telephone ? the gunthers across the valley . they ' re mennonite . they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even .
no . i ' d want a public phone .
what for ? i just sat down .
la train . at one-thirty , and we have to pack .
. i found me a room , but it ' s clear the hell and gone ' cross town . and i think i got a job lined up doin ' tune-ups in a texaco station . how you like it at winstead ' s ?
how do you know where i work ?
but these are white people , anybody . the punch .
i don ' t care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
i ' d never be able to live with mysel --
nothing ' s going to happen . besides , i have to work tonight . the conference is in less than two weeks . i ' ve got to stay focused on that for just a little longer . this is .
that ' s my point ! you see <person> . burning at his absolute . to see all the forces just come together , just right , you know , just in perfect harmony . that ' s what i ' m driving at . you get me ?
i think so .
something coming for you , <person> .
just when i think there ' s hope for you .
i mean it . i may go live with my brother gregory in princeton .
you mean the brother gregory in princeton who never calls you ?
<person> ! that ' s exactly what i ' m saying . my father said , first of all , i ' m your father not your friend . i ' m your father .
are you solid with that ?
i speak french , english , <person> , <person> , and <person> .
that must come in handy .
uhhhh -- yes .
i don ' t believe you !
you don ' t got the game .
i got every shot in the book .
please . tell me who <person> sells to .
even if i knew i wouldn ' t tell you . you do not want to come into contact with these people . only <person> knows who they are . that ' s his real asset . <person> doesn ' t know them . they don ' t know <person> . <person> and state .
well , she ' s not the only one with a limited conversation . at least she has an excuse , she ' s a baby ! what ' s yours ?
i frankly don ' t know what you mean .
oh , <person> !
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio , didn ' t you ?
mr . <person> , i swear to you , he ' s lying !
<person> , you ' re making more problems than you are sales .
tell me , how come me and suzie have to be mother and father to your child ? you never take the boy to the park , circus or anything . if we did not take him to church , he wouldn ' t have any sense of religion .
i think forcing him to go to church when he really doesn ' t understand is not saving his soul . when he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion , that will be better . it will be his intellectual decision .
okay , it ' s <person> ' s father . so what ?
so why would <person> want to help my father move to <person> ?
<person> . x <number> .
i read , <person> .
and the windows ?

i ' m sorry , <person> , i just didn ' t want you to be late . <continued_utterance> <person> .
<person> , but why me ? what if the car doesn ' t stop ?
then i ' m a rich man .
then you must be the one ' s a liar , right ? and you ' re a performer ?
i guess .
<person> , we ' ve talked about this .
no , you ' ve talked about it and i ' ve listened . in my opinion , <person> ' s smile is not oedipal regression and it ' s not confused libido . it ' s one good looking guy drooling over you , <person> .
please .
<person> . <person> .
i don ' t understand a picnic . we just go some place . we put a thing on the ground , and we eat .
yes . it ' s nice to do that .
i was in the bank today . the federal on <person> . a clerk was talking about somebody named <person> messing with her baby . is that the stranger you ' re talking about ?
no . no . i ' ve never seen her before . i know you already think i ' m going out of my mind but i genuinely believe the world revolves around me somehow . everybody seems to be in on it .
we sell ' em to you for three bucks a piece !
and i appreciate it .
i ' m hoping that ' s just decorative .
next !
that ' s right .
you want to book the flight ?
can we stealth these guys ?
doubtful . with all that coke , they ' ll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two . even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat , we get nothing . mcmanus and if we wait for the money ? <continued_utterance> ten more men at least . in my opinion , it can ' t be done . anyone who walks into this won ' t come out alive . mcmanus i ' m for waiting for the money .
<person> .
he ' d been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected .
she is my granddaughter ! <person> , stop ! <person> ' t hurt her , please ! <person> ' t hurt her . a soldier roughly shoves <person> at him .
you don ' t need them ! there are so many others !
<person> ' t expect a turkey dog in here .
hey , slow pokes , guess what ? there ' s no tomorrow . <continued_utterance> <person> , you know why ? cause it ' ll never get here .
that guy went ballistic on me .
i hope you told him off .
stop worrying . he won ' t get any place with her .

what does that have to do with anything ?
i dunno . they ' re interesting .
where ?
hell , i can ' t remember . <person> ' bly see him again though . tell you what . you leave the money with me , i ' ll see he gets it . as a favor to you .
i had to see <person> . i know you really don ' t like <person> , but there was a problem and i didn ' t think you would understand .
oh , honey , you don ' t have to lie to me . ever . you can tell me anything . i ' ll understand .
it ' s vivid .
if i weren ' t me , i would buy a cd by me .
<person> . are we still going to mexico ?
yes .
by monday i promise . i have a paper due friday . now what ' s going on ? i ' m just going to stand here till you tell me .
is it infidelity if you ' re involved with someone on e-mail ?
for scaring you like i did . when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day .
and then you weren ' t there .
<person> . you know i ' m married to some one else now .
but i want a baby . a family ! i want to burp him and change him and . love him ! why couldn ' t it have been with me ?

c ' mon , <person> ! <person> ' t you see who we ' ve got on board today ?

i don ' t know what to do .
i ' d be honored .

yeah , but don ' t worry about it , i ' ll be back before it ' s time for her next bottle . she ' s asleep now .
<person> , just terrific ! <person> just called : i have to go to the office right now .

approaching the first gate .

<person> , i ' m stuck . you happy ? now can you fix it , or not ?
yeah , i can fix it .
session ' s over . you better leave .
i ' m gon na qualify for the u . s . open and kick your boyfriend ' s ass .
just insecurity . <person> crunching gut splinters .
what does that mean ?
yes , but my condition is only temporary . i can change it .
i hope you do . we need the money .
i tried to save her . but she remained a manic depressive : fits , inappropriate behavior . delusions of grandeur .
i wonder if it runs in the family .
do you remember when <person> climbed up - - the tower of the city hall and rang the bell by swinging on the clapper ? he couldn ' t hear anything for two days .
<person> ! too bad he didn ' t make it .
all we ' ve got to do is make it to the top .
and find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the humvee , and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off , but that ' s about it .
i do love a good check mate .
what do you want ?
you ' re not like my other teachers , <person> .
you ' re not like my other students , <person> . so what was the movie you two saw ?
you don ' t . our job is to find <person> . and why is that out ?
i ' m making notes separate from- -i thought we were investigating <person> ' s disappearance-
the soldiers may give you a hard time . whatever . if we weren ' t around , they ' d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides , rotting in the sun .
will i need protection ?
<person> ' s store .
who ' s that ?
i still got a day job , pete-
-tossing more bantamweights out windows ?
a trailer was here . what the hell do you think ?
can you tell me who ' s trailer it was .
oh , yeah . <person> yourself .
i ' m braced .
two weeks ago she left me . for the owner of a pizza parlor .
that ' s awful .
i don ' t want it this way . i wouldn ' t kill you just to kill you , but i can ' t let you lose the gold for me . not when we ' re so close .
that helicopter passes , and the only thing we ' re close to is death .
he cared enough to want you to have it .
he phoned it in .
is that in my chart ?
i spoke with the woman who saved your life . you ' re lucky she came along when she did . grady considers the larger ramifications of this statement
you , of course . i need some information .
<person> , i ' m a civilian . this is my place . used to be the royal family ' s , now it ' s mine . i run my little business , i stay out of trouble .
it ' s me , don ' t you see . <person> ' s right , i ' m the escape hatch . i disobeyed order .
you taking the order wouldn ' t have changed anything .
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty .
unbearable , i ' d imagine .
<person> , man . i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had . <continued_utterance> i ' ve got five . six dollars .
then you ' re only a hundred-forty-five in the hole . you can keep that dollar . now why don ' t you just take your american express gold card , and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split .
that doesn ' t matter , your team sucks . plus i even look more like a coach then <person> .
<person> , that ' s not really value added .
i heard <person> on the news again tonight -- i don ' t know : i hate the democrats and the republicans , but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn ' t seem like . . a liar .
<person> -- the senator from rome .
are you okay ? <continued_utterance> we have to get out of here .
it ' s alright .
yeah !
now go get molly . your friends are going to be here any minute .

breakfast is getting cold .
lean back !
uh , <person> . is the launchpad construction complete ? -- uh , <person> , rocket is now secured to guide wire . we are currently obtaining the . ignition sticks . <person> will commence momentarily . stand by --
what kind of trouble ?
if we see a thief or a pickpocket , we just slap him around -- maybe cut off a finger or an ear , or the tip of his nose , lower lip -- anything you can just grab and slice in one fluid motion -- then we take our share of the loot and let him go . mostly what we worry about are activist types , rabble rousers , getting people all riled up against the king or the temple priests .
operator , what does that mean ?
i ' m sorry , sir , that line seems to be disconnected .
<person> , big favor .
you didn ' t have to come with me , you know . i didn ' t ask you to come .
oh , my !
and bears !
my parents are at services . they won ' t be back for hours .
shall we have breakfast , my love ?
did you drop this baby ?
<person> , no . the baby screams .
i was invited . what ' s your story ?
i don ' t know who you are or where you come from , but i don ' t like you . you ask too many questions .
she did it .
we don ' t know that for sure .
plant him in potter ' s <person> . he doesn ' t need a marked grave .
<person> , your true colors are unbearable . you got some mean ways . <person> ' t worry about the boy getting a burial . he still has some friends left on this earth .
<person> on !
watch the legs !
<person> ' t . i know what you ' re going to say .
no , really , <person> , i don ' t think you --
you think you ' re working with chimps here ?
the thing is , i made a commitment . i said i ' d do it and i have to keep my word .
whats that ?
feed store keeps up to five k in their safe . need me a good boy for back-up . even split . you interested ?
not at present , sir . but i think the prudent answer is we don ' t know .
do we have any sort of intelligence from cia on what <person> is thinking ?
oh , look -- there goes <person> . <person> ' t she sweet ?
i wish .
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser <person> and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .
i never heard of him .
quick way . get a book of matches out of your pocket to light your cigarette . you drop the matches on the floor .
<person> .
bang the door .
really .
i want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me . all you ' ve ever known is duty . to me and to a political career that unless i can walk no longer exists . you ' ve been exemplary . now i ' m telling you you ' re free to go .
no . i don ' t want freedom . i want a marriage . i want a life with you .
you mean that horrible screeching ?
it wasn ' t constructed for its aesthetic values , you know , but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter . now go on .
no .
that ' s why you never had a bioport . you were one of them .
what are you thinking about ?
if i ever get my hands on the guy that made that call .
nothing we can do about that .
yes , there is . i ' d like to go up .
everything , but everything .
oh , <person> .
they ' re not givin ' you any safe conduct . soon as the shooting starts kick east for the new mexico line . well .
<person> , i . i ain ' t got the words .
tomorrow ?
yes , sheeni , thanksgiving . i ' ll be coming for dinner , of course .
no , no , no , no . the soil on the shovel , his shovel . that ' s clay . it ' s not from here , believe me , i . all right , look at this .
our house .
<person> carefully . you will be lying to the man you love . the person who trusts you the most .
i can do it !
jesus .
crabtree said it sounded like something <person> would be messed up in .
it ' s okay . i ' m okay .
you ' re not okay . we ' re not okay .
must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown . not one of them so much as lifted a finger . - a curious attitude - in a curious world . <person> ' t you the least bit interested in what i am . where i come from ? the girl should i be ? time traveller perhaps you ' d better take me to someone a bit older i can talk to .
there is no one older .
the cyclops is a captain ? he must ' ve made a pact with the devil .
or the cardinal .
oh .
wan na come in and wait for her ?
let me take a look at it . <continued_utterance> are you all together ?
yes .
how would she know ?
but i ' m really not here to try to get you to do anything , or to believe anything . and i ' ll tell you the same thing i told her , which is that as far as i ' m concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you , by the way she lives her life . <continued_utterance> and that doesn ' t mean she ' s supposed to be a saint , either , if that ' s what you ' re smiling about .
you ' re trying to tell me you can read all that from a track ?
no . not just a track . you got ta listen to the trees , man . to the leaves . to this sand , you fbi ' s kicked all up . you got ta listen to the earth .
do you ? <continued_utterance> what about the uranium ?
it ' s on the boat . he ' s holding a press conference tomorrow . <continued_utterance> i ' m so sorry , <person> . i promise , i ' ll never leave you again .
i couldn ' t agree with you more .
go ahead then . my accountant will contact you .
come on , i was hamburger . you were porterhouse .
maybe on the outside . but inside , deep down , i ' ve always been dripping with special sauces . are you hungry ?
not now . i don ' t have time .
i saw that look pass between you and <person> at the fight . <person> to me ! you ' re mine ! understand ?
oh , right . yes . <person> says the guy ' s a sweetheart . <person> ' t hurt a fly .
huh .
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee ?
isn ' t this where you saw her ? <continued_utterance> then this is where she ' ll be . <continued_utterance> place your fingers on the planchette .
<person> ! get in there before i make a dime bank out of you ! <person> , kid , are you going to let that old gulch heifer try and buffalo you ? <continued_utterance> she ain ' t nothing to be afraid of . have a little courage , that ' s all .
i ' m not afraid of her .
i ' m on the wagon , man , sorry .
ahh . dope-wise , this place sucks . <person> fuckin ' coons around here , eh ?
what makes a man like <person> , <person> ?
a man like <person> ' s got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he can ' t ever fill it . he can ' t kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it . and it drives him mad .
you ' ll never find out who did it .
you underestimate me , brooks .
<person> that . where is your partner ?
vouching in evidence at wilshire station .
yes ! who was she ?
i don ' t know . she was standing outside my building with the police and the reporters .
oh right , the pediatrician .
this kind .
not that long . <person> came in --
<person> !
forty .
i ' ll give you twenty and not a penny more .
i ' ll give you a grand to locate and tail <person> .
your partner ?
i ' ve been very lazy for a long , long time .
you seem like you ' re anything but lazy , <person> .
no , mama , im in mexico , and were about to get on an airplane to argentina !
argentina ! <person> , youre outta your mind . now you just tell me where you are and <person> come for you . i wont say nothin to the police about <person> , i promise . he can do what he wants , i dont care .
i don ' t care , just get me there .
how about <person> ? you could take a local , arrives in two hours , and transfer in albuquerque . it ' ll get you across the border .
. i couldn ' t hear it clearly , i was standing by the door , the voices were low --
go on .
remember about the light you ' re supposed to see when you ' re dyin ' ?
<person> , don ' t think about that now .
cut the crap , x , i saw you down there . you ' re a hero . <person> ' t be afraid to join the good guys .
who says you ' re the good guys ?
well , think of it as playing a role . it ' s fantasy . you have to work on their dreams . get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
<person> ' t that hard to keep up , in the long run ?
why does everyone find that so surprising ?
cause . your . only daughter just went away to school . who you were incredibly close with aaand i ' d be tripping .
what ' s his name ? our friend from mi- <number> ?
<person> .
if i ever get out of here .
if i ever get out of here , i ' m having my eyes lasered .
what you ' re saying is you don ' t want to discuss this , am i right ?
you like pool ?
you ' re really . you , are you the one they told me was the nurse ?
who told you that ?
our characters did . i ' m sure it would be very different if we did .
i . i ' m actually just like that in real life . you got the real ted pikul there , in the stockroom of the game store .
do you love me ?
what kind of stupid question is that ?
where is it ? where ' d it go ?
<person> low .
my number one would be getting out of beaufort .
getting out won ' t be your problem . it ' ll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere .
then we ' re both traitors : <person> said <person> ' s `kleinsasser ' was two syllables too long .
i wouldn ' t have expected so public a showing after <person> .
i ' m not wasting my water on him . <continued_utterance> i don ' t care what he says , he wanted our gold . would have slit our throats if he had the chance .
<person> ' t matter . whatever he wanted he didn ' t get it . we ' ve got no need staying around here . it ' s light enough . <person> ' s pack up and head out .
what ? how do you know about my father ?
the most valuable commodity i know of is information . <person> ' t you agree on that ?
some kinda legal secretary of something . <person> to some boring jerk . <continued_utterance> and she could be so hot , if she wanted to be . she ' s like a dying plant that just needs a little water .
but with you , she gets to be hot , right ?
write what you want . just try not to make it so obvious that you ' re crazy about me .
<person> must be peachy on <person> .
you start her up .
how ' s that ?
what ' s it going to do , being a plant ?
we got to burn ' em .
let me look at you . <continued_utterance> now remember , this is another kind of business . they don ' t earn your respect . you owe it to them . <person> ' t stare them down but don ' t look away either . confidence . they are fools not to trust you . that ' s the attitude .
i ' m having a stroke .
yeah , it ' s brian .
brian --
well , i suppose the empty street meant loneliness .
you ' re a shrink . you ' ve got to do better than that .
what are you looking for ?
your grandfather ' s written washington asking if he can get back in active service . i think he wants to fly jets .
me and wes each going take an end of the rope , run our asses of , and yank you off the mine .
that ' s going to do it , right ? i ' m going to be okay .
you think it ' s funny ? me locked in ?
locked in where ?
i suppose . well , it ' s possible someone might have lifted it from me . but .
that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt . now how could somebody get to it without you knowing ?
ah , i see . a purely . plutonic relationship . <continued_utterance> really <person> , couldn ' t you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears ?
what ' s your business with <person> ?
my god , <person> , look at this .
the name is so familiar but --
soon . how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about ?
i can arrange that . i like that . <continued_utterance> what are you doing ?
i swear , before yesterday , neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this . but if you ever met my husband , you ' d know why i just can . you wan na step out of the car , please ? you wan na put your hands on your head , please ? <person> , shoot the radio .
what ?
what the hell are you doin ' ?
what do you mean what am i doin ' --
kind of a sign , you ' re saying .
in a sense .
i can ' t find manolo .
he ' s not here .
if there isn ' t i ' ve just wasted the last six months .
that ' s the problem . we need results . the press is driving us crazy over this p <number> p thing . calling us the ' speed capitol of the country ' . you know the sort of thing . it ' s getting political . the commissioner ' s getting very uneasy .
why ?
i think you must have an idea . they cited a history of problems relating back to <number> .
and it ' s over . ?
yes .
um . because it ' s bad . <person> ' t ever do it .
i won ' t .
oh , right , a snap to find the one single person in the world who fills your heart with joy .
<person> ' t be ridiculous . have i ever been with anyone who fits that description ?
forged in the crusades , handed from generation to generation .
and now to me .
<person> ? ! where ? !
down there . just down there . a helpless toy . it ' s . it ' s trapped , <person> !
what ?
cash only .
you ' re amazing .
i know .
no .
so talk to us about something .
<person> ' s mosey over to the post office , i ' m expecting a letter any day .
oh , i beg your pardon , sir . that ' s what i came over to give you , it slipped my mind .
i had just been left by <person> . i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason , it made me feel better that your life wasn ' t as perfect as it seemed . <continued_utterance> by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you , <person> called from the hospital and it was too late .
<person> late ? jody , it was an accident .
<person> ' t tell me : heavy duty .
<person> , heavy duty . <person> . <person> . it ' s one of those few places we ' d never go to as kids . still don ' t . some of the old people say <person> is buried back there . we have to go <person> . together . like his vision .
g ' morning .
what are you doing ?
i don ' t know , thelma ! i don ' t know ! just shut up a minute so i can think .
<person> ' t we go to the cops ? i mean , i think we should tell the police .
four dollars . i want to pay four dollars a month .
that ' s not an honest answer .
exactly . now yell and scream and suffer !
ow ! ahh ! ow ! that really hurts .
<person> .
<person> was she there ?
you act like an idiot , you look fine .
you said you ' d get me a new uniform .
you wanted to talk ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na start fighting .
oh , no .
who is it ?
that ' s dumb . a little funny , though . how come your dad never comes to meetings with you ?
i don ' t have a dad . <person> did . i sprang full-blown from my mother ' s forehead . you want to walk home with me and <person> ?
possibly .
you might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter .
he won ' t go . he doesn ' t want to be seen walking on crutches or being wheeled to the podium .
the millions listening on radio won ' t be able to see that .
that ' s right . <person> around .
the people are glad they sent you . they usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams , screamin ' `` drop it , <person> '' , stick a gun in your face , frisk ya down . even if ya got a child with ya . no , it ' s good to have ya . it ' s gon na be was-te times on the res . <continued_utterance> i was gon na warn ya about messin ' with somebody ' s medicine bundle but i forgot you know all about that stuff .
how long will it last ?
i don ' t know . this time is different . we were unprepared .
oh , i ' m so glad you ' re not a dinosaur !
why , thank you . now thank you all for your kind welcome .
that has more to do with your proximity to me .
my desire betrays me , like goosebumps on my flesh .
he ' s not my boyfriend . i mean , i let him take me out and stuff , but i ain ' t spoken for . not yet that is .
get it through your head , little girl ; i ' m not going for you . if this <person> likes you , then if i were you i ' d marry him . you ' re not going to get much better in this town .
what ? no . no .
you didn ' t ? <continued_utterance> cause that would be really -- she lays back on the bed . sounds of flushing .
yep .
<person> , <person> , <person> .
are you sure we should be driving like this ? in broad daylight and everything ?
no we shouldn ' t , but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime !
when i walked out of here last night i said to myself , `` dr . <person> ' s absolutely right . take a vacation from your problems . <person> em off . just say ' no ' . `` so i did !
but . you ' re back .
i ' don ' t know if she ' d want me to tell you that , <person> .
i ' m not going to stalk her . <person> . i just . . want to know where i stand . <person> looks up , incredulous .
i ' m not sure .
did you send in all of the deposit checks ?
<person> called us out of the rigging .
but your instinct was to lose sail ?
the talking rings .
what sort of rings ?
you didn ' t pick this up yesterday -- congratulations , you got nothing higher than a c .
<person> up .
it ' s a beautiful town , prague . it ' s been good to me .
i ' ve been here before , when i was a kid . my old man was in the service , we used to live on the army base in hamburg .
<person> , well i do . get the jesus up , and get the jesus out or i ' m gon na go out to my truck and come back with my hardware .
<person> , hold on there , <person> , you ' re --
<person> skull .
toss it up here , dude .
i ' ll grow old . we ' ll both die . and we ' ll never have known each other . that ' s sad . at least one drink for a dreamer . what ' s your favorite drink ?
grand marnier .
have you been hurt ?
me ? no . well , in the accident i was injured , but .
who fights about that ?
some people . not us .
<person> . forget him .
i can ' t help it . he gives me the creeps . i mean why was <person> so scared of him ? she ' s not that way . i think he did something .
is he talking ?
he regained consciousness less than an hour ago . he spoke - not english - then he lapsed .
what ?
who ' s the beauty ?
what flavor ?
chocolate chip .
well , when you figure it out , wake me up .
just what the hell is wrong with you ?
you aren ' t from delaware , are you ?
well , see , it ' s kind of complicated-
<person> ' s make another pass .
we have traffic on the deck -
oh , no . <person> ' s gone completely overboard . <continued_utterance> sweetheart , what is it ?
i always wanted <person> tools . he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors .
you made it . was-te .
you must be . president <person> .
can i read it when you ' re done ?
it ' s not very good .
what will you have ?
couple of eggs over , some hash browns , some toast -- toasted dark . butter on the side , large grapefruit juice and some coffee . <continued_utterance> on second thought , instead of the eggs over , if i ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells ?
i don ' t like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it ' s hard to scoop the stuff out . it ' s not good . and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn ' t taste good .
why don ' t you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it . all right ?
in theory .
you ' re going to arrest me for breaking and entering ?
i say they should put more meats on a stick , you know ? they got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles , fudgesicles , lollipops -- but hardly any meat .
i agree there should be more .
i ' ll sell it to you .
you monster . how much for ?
the course of love is full of frightful turns . but , no matter how you feel , no matter how hopelessly afraid . never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in france . <person> that your starting point , and everything else will fall . into place .
the bravest man in france .
by reading my thoughts ?
if necessary .
and mainly ours . <continued_utterance> leave a bit of an opening so he can see out . <continued_utterance> how you doin ' , old boy ?
i don ' t know who to trust .
madmartigan . <person> down with a family huh ?
you left me to die , friend .
all that talk about the wind .

intensive psychotherapy .

he couldn ' t play football anymore .
what do you think they were fighting about ? <person> don ' t fancy dope-pushing wetbacks .
what about the son ?
of course .
he was a . good lover ?
we ' re leaving from my house in three hours . if you want to come , get your numbers in order by then .
first of all .
you can ' t harness him .
he ' s got to be collared .
there won ' t be a kingdom to protect if you ' re afraid to act ! <continued_utterance> whatever the cost , the world must know that the new king of <person> will not be held in contempt .
that ' s pride and vanity that talks ! not leadership ! have you forgotten everything i ' ve taught you ? what of a warrior ' s patience , cunning ?
no letter ? no wire ?
why ? would you have answered it ?
no , it ' s not me , i mean she ' s not mine .
oh , so it ' s <person> ' s ?
oh yes . he ' s just had too much to drink , that ' s all . i hope you had a good time tonight . i wanted so much to make things up to you .
<person> was your idea ?
i think i ' ve really fucked up . i think i ' ve got us in a situation where we could both get killed . why didn ' t we just go straight to the police .
you know why . you already said .
it ' s a sketchbook . that ' s <person> ' sketchbook !
it ' s a picture of joey . well , i never !
i hate to bust your bubble honey , but i wasn ' t defending you .
but you was going to fight for me .
and where might that be ?
i was thinking , <person> , maybe .
i thought i ' d better stay .
you needn ' t have troubled yourself .
people are miserable all over the world and you ' re killing yourself ? you should be ashamed .
<person> ' t talk that way to me !
figured what out ?
who i am , outside of this boat .
<person> ' s see . <person> step through the office . <person> step out the door .
that ' s perfect . keep going .
i ' d say it ' s exactly as advertised .
<person> , it ' s ugly . even for a game- pod .
<person> this is --
<person> .
<person> , peaches , okay . but can i ask you one thing ?
maybe .
obey my commands at all times . defend yourselves at all times . touch gloves , go back , let ' s do this .
should i be nervous for <person> ? `cause i am . i want to stop the fight before it even begins .
forget the pope , <person> . every week you got the pope somewhere . this is a very big story down here because it ' s the first sign of fighting in managua . <person> , well get a map and look up <person> -- ya drive to new orleans and turn left . <continued_utterance> like hell i ' m editorializing , the whole thing happened in a roomful of c . i . a . and press . what do you want ? ! how do i know they were c . i . a . ? they wore name tags , what do you think ? we ' re backing a fascist again -- i know that ain ' t news , but see if you can find an angle !
hey ! there ' s fascists and then there ' s fascists , right ? be careful how you throw words like that around .
i am <person> , king of this realm .
and i am --
have you taken the dogs through ?
yes , sir .
ok . <person> . could you just take a look at my radiator hose . it ' s busted . <continued_utterance> so ?
it ' s your radiator hose . it ' s busted .
just listen to me ! i ' ve been doing some reading . in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks . it became part of the ottoman empire . when the turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards . they buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle boxes . i read about this , man . i read about it .
<person> , if you read it it must be true .
but your clubs are your livelihood .
well the hood ain ' t too lively at the moment . <continued_utterance> whoever it is , tell ' em i ' m in houston on business .
construction ' s not exactly my line .
quite the opposite , in fact .
<person> , i got ta feelin ' about somethin ' and i just wan na ask your opinion . do you think thelma <person> would have committed armed robbery if you hadn ' t taken all their money ? <continued_utterance> <person> got your tongue ?
how do you know i took it ? how do you know they didn ' t just give it to me ?
no we ' re not . the bodies are all mixed up . we can ' t do this to them .
she ' s asian . they don ' t have jews in asia .
what do you mean ?
i mean it ' s open . anyone ' s got a shot at it . you just got ta get past a local and a sectional qualifier , and unlike doral or colonial or the a . t . t . , they can ' t keep you out . they can ' t ask you if you ' re a garbageman or a bean- picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper . you qualify , you ' re in .
not much with these sub-rosa things .
i thought it was <person> tailing me .
that ' s good . is she smitten with you ?
not yet .
i ' m working on it . <continued_utterance> you moonlighting ?
doing some ad hoc dope seizures for <person> . still love taking the occasional door down .
the museum ? i thought we were going out to dinner ?
we will , but first i have a surprise .
why am i suddenly worried i ' m not carrying enough insurance ? <continued_utterance> see ? you ' re upsetting my customers .
how does a terrorist like <person> supply his men with state-of-the-art russian army weapons ?
we got the smoke in frame ?
we got the smoke .
what you see , son , is a man who never measured success by the size of a man ' s wallet .
that ' s because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim .
maybe you didn ' t check it good enough .
i did . i swear .
clearly you did not understand . you did not even attempt relations last evening .
what you ' re asking to do is sick .
stand still , wench ! i want to see what ' s under that skirt .
i ' m sorry ! it was an accident .
believe me , i ' m trying to get this over with as fast as i can . but <person> will probably have to come back and testify .
we do not go into your courts .
<person> ' t much look like you were hanging drapes .
i swear to you that ' s all that happened . i haven ' t so much as set foot in your bedroom .
for pay ?
for the inner satisfaction it will bring . saturday mornings , i ' d like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
<person> ' t even bother , x man , i ' m not your type .
that right ? why ' s that ?
<person> , can i talk to you for a second ?
oh , hi , <person> , yeah sure . <continued_utterance> . please darling , don ' t move . i ' ll be right back , okay ? i ' ll bring us back some champagne . <continued_utterance> you ' re a lifesaver , <person> . i thought i ' d never get away . <person> ' s waiting for me in the living room . <person> ' t she terrific ?
very funny . no , this buys you time .
what about <person> ?
jesus . what are you drinking ? <continued_utterance> anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain ?
what brain ? <continued_utterance> what are you looking at ?
we ' re grownups , russell . most of us .
you two wanta happy snap ?
i ' ll bet . <person> , <person> . why don ' t you come by this weekend . we ' ll take the boat out .
<person> , <person> . i ' ve got plans .
let ' s see . the tractor kid gets five bucks an hour . <person> , he gets ten cash --
what do you pay yourself ?
not me . i don ' t want to go where they ' ve got snakes .
they ' ve got snakes ?
<person> , my friend , that can only be you . why don ' t we put our weapons down for a few minutes and discuss this like friends . how would you like to come to work for us instead ? we could rage against the machine together .
speaking of people that are full of shit , funny you should mention those guys ! <continued_utterance> they put their records out through <person> , one of the biggest corporate machines on the planet . some revolutionaries , huh ?
on the other hand , you ' re making strides . you got here .
i baby stepped . i owe it to you .
maybe you should treat her more like a lady .
after she ran off with that dallas banker ?
<person> . i got ta get some air --
look at me -- well , not right at the moment -- but listen to me . you ' re with the wrong guy . i ' m the right guy . everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum ' cause i ' ve been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it ' s also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people . such is life . so dump that phony bastard and come to the open in my corner -- you can delay your romantic urges , which i know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess -- until the appropriate time . tell me you ' re not at least moderately attracted to me . <person> stands there with the ball still dangling from his hat , the leather straps , the bucket , the arrows -- for the moment he ' s forgotten how stupid he looks .
say , where were you anyway ? we said five minutes to six .
i ' m sorry . but , <person> , women are always discreetly late . it ' s expected of us .
and this is not my first time on a private jet , so quit acting like i ' m <person> of sunnybrook farm .
a little respect would be nice , that ' s all .
you may want to put some ice on that ! <continued_utterance> you may be taller , but i ' m wider ! <continued_utterance> it ' s not too late for you to surrender . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t let them grab hold of you ! <continued_utterance> thank you , my lady . but i nearly had him !
of course you did .
i guess you must be , if you know the
right . <continued_utterance> we , better skedaddle . close that closet -- <person> ? you ail right ?
oh no !
oh yes !
judge <person> , yeah . if it wasn ' t for her i ' d probably be out of business already . i just need more .
is there anything else you can do for money ?
. we were trying to restore her heartbeat .
what happened in those three minutes . ?
yes . but that ' s not why i called .
<person> ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> you really look awful .
not half as bad as i feel .

you ' ve got a warped thought process . your brain doesn ' t function properly .
so what happened ?
i decided not to go home .
it ' s not what they say it is .
whatever it is , the government seems to think it ' s theirs . you intend to just walk in there and take it ?
woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle . she called the police and they came over and arrested me . thought i was a sniper ! boys at the vfw loved that one . <person> didn't understand about the pigeons , the damage they do to personal property . i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger . i was gon na put out poison , but i was afraid somebodys cat would eat it . <person> , i had six cats myself . so i used the . <number> because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap .
what happened on the charges ?
and where are you going to sleep ?
well , i expect you to show me to my quarters .
i ' m looking for my daughter , <person> . she comes here .
this is a business . get the fuck outta here .
i thought i loved her .
chicks are like buses . if you miss one , don ' t sweat it . there ' s another coming ' round the corner . <continued_utterance> take your pick . they ' re identical .
this all happened because of you , didn ' t it --
well , i knew <person> loved children ' s books so i wrote a provocative column --

under arrest ? no , i ' m the officer working the case of his stolen car .
<person> evening . it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary .
you should go back and rest .
it was so real .
here ' s the thing ; whenever you ' re having a nightmare , all you have to do is say <number> - <number> - <number> wake up ! you ' ll be out of it . you ' ll wake up .
huh . <person> , yeah , it is sorta .
they use a laser .
you got a lotta philosophy in you , old timer but you don ' t fool me for one second with all this blind man crap . one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam , next it ' s the joint . now it ' s a woman ? i ' m hep to you .
used to be a young smartass like you . then i got smart with the wrong man ' s daughter . got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble . you know human beings ain ' t always just human -- they got animals living inside ' em too . people give spare change to war heroes not fools . all fools get is pity . may not have eyes , but i see . and you , boy ? the blind man puts his glasses back on . <continued_utterance> you got my pity . bobby hope she was worth it . <continued_utterance> oh , she was worth it . she was worth every black minute since .

i was as sorry as anyone to hear about mr . <person> ' s passing . wished he coulda ' lived to see this !
what are you talking about ?
now <person> is dead . he got his revenge .
he ' s not through yet . <person> doesn ' t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there ' s more coming in . he ' s working for someone . someone who wants to stop the pipeline . and they hired the perfect killer . one with a vendetta against king . and you .

<person> , thou wast sent to stay my hand by the eternal one , blessed be he .
i just don ' t see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride . did you see his butt ? <person> doesn ' t have a cute butt . you could park a car in the shadow of his ass .
i ' m sorry . i ' m just not in the mood for company right now . here . take this map . i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city . i think we should stay off the interstates . we ' re too conspicuous .

i don ' t have his number .
they can patch you in through the switchboard . <continued_utterance> hey ! we don ' t have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command . the order came direct from general mcaddie . call him . we ' ll conduct our business while you confirm authorization .

my third great uncle - the earl of aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese . his son-in-law - <person> - made the first family fortune , running opium into shanghai . his son , <person> , who lost it , smoking the opium . and my grandfather <person> , who opened the first telegraph station , and published the colony ' s first english newspaper . it was a city of unlimited possibility .
so why did you leave ?
-- if they mine uranium there , these people will have no place left to go .
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters , <person> . i don ' t know about uranium , i don ' t know about <person> -- all i know is we did our job . it ' s over .
it ' s sacrilegious .
how do you figure ?
hi . is he here ?
no . he slept at <person> ' s . how about you ?
<person> to me , you thankless little prick . we ' re your parents , so don ' t you dare talk to me disrespectfully . what the hell is it , this captain ?
it has nothing to do with him .
does august know where you are ?
no . he thinks i ' m with <person> and the girls . he won ' t go there .
yeah , you want it ?
yeah .
why do you say that ?
i don ' t know . he was always -- he always had to be better than you at everything . you know . like if you were all playing basketball or something , everybody ' s havin ' like a friendly game and he ' s like ready to kill somebody if his team didn ' t win . or like if you told like a joke or a story , he always had to tell a better one ? kinda gets annoying after a while . plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you . he was a prick . probably still a prick . fortunately for you though , your mom is like , the greatest . so you had some bad luck and you had some good luck . you mind if i ask you a personal question ?
you and i have done nothing . you especially . we are innocent .
i don ' t think so .
<person> .
<person> ' t be too much longer until dawn . <person> ' s bound to come along then . a snowplow or something .
i sure enjoy smokin , <person> . i hate that its bad for you . <continued_utterance> that mans a black angel , <person> . you hook up with him , youll regret it . if you live to .
thanks , darlin , i know you got my best interest in mind , and i preciate it sincerely . i love you , but i got ta sleep now .
i ' ve never drawn such a true likeness before .
<person> ' s finished .
this is about <person> .
<person> ? you ' re fucking crazy . we are not invading <person> . nobody gives a rat ' s ass about <person> . not now , not ever . if you print something like that , all you ' re going to do is inflame the situation . nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations . <person> like that can find themselves cut out of the loop .
what do you mean by that ?
what do you mean by asking ?
that was about as grim as it gets .
the guy was history when he killed <person> . you knew that .
they sure do stink .
<person> , i guess , but - and heres the lesson part - they aint supposed to be so bad for you .
no , only heard of them .
who told you ?
i came for <person> .
you came to take my wife from me ? <continued_utterance> shhh ! liar .
what does that mean ?
it means i ' m supposed to give you up , and i ' m never supposed to see you again .
no , and yes . i don ' t know what i ' m going to do about <person> . i know he is seeing someone else and that ' s okay with me , and he thinks i ' m seeing someone else and that ' s not okay with him .
are you going to tell him about that `` someone else '' ?
why you so damn anxious to let him in here .
he ' s so close . maybe our best chance to blow him away .
i do .
you said you ' d cut that up with the man who did her in .
oz .
you ain ' t from oz . oz is in that movie .
yes .
. <person> <number> , ' if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' is that what happened to <person> ? she aspirated into her mask ?
the only proof is those bodies .
so what do we do ?
its a mistake , honey . you two go on .
whatre you talkin about ? thats your son in there .
i need a gun .
it can ' t be that bad .
<person> ' towel .
what ?
i dunno . they ' re interesting .
what ?
i don ' t like looking at my own .
get some honey from the cookhouse . and if you can find any slippery elm powder . but the honey should do it . if not , we ' ll check her for parasites .
we ' ll see . if it doesn ' t , what the hell , at least i gave it a shot .
that ' s right . and the good thing is you can do it anywhere .
he ' s a fucking cop .
we got the wire ya was comin ' . you ' re the indian official , yeah ?
i ' m surprised you ' re surprised .
i can ' t keep this banter going .
i ' m surprised you aren ' t more cooperative , mr . <person> . a human has been murdered by a toon . <person> ' t you appreciate the magnitude of that ? my goal as judge of toontown , has been to rein in the insanity . to bring a semblance of law and order to a place where no civilized person has ever been able to step foot . the only way to do that is to make the toons respect the law . <continued_utterance> why , you filthy little vagrant , you ' ve soiled my robe !
it ' s cleanin ' up real good . judge .
`` no little girl can ever make me come . `` <person> . too bad . we might have some physical evidence .
i don ' t know . it feels wrong .
the casket of ancient winters belonged to the jotuns . they believe it ' s their birthright .
and if you hadn ' t taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the nine realms !
i . yes . it is .
and you wrote that .
<person> jumped on your car with their butt . -

he looked like one of the monkees .
<person> , <person> slept with him .
they took her --
agent mulder --
why i did it ? i don ' t know . <person> ? i thought i was doing the guy a favor .
this wasn ' t your first time , was it , <person> ? how many we talking ?
maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss , and were really mean to you , and told you what a terrible thing it was . maybe it ' d be better if you told me how i ' m endangering my immortal soul , and if i don ' t quit i ' m going to burn in hell . <person> ' t you ever think that ?
um . no .
<person> great . what will that be ?
we ' re just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar . acoustic .
take it . <continued_utterance> now , get the hell off my ship .
you ' ll really have something to teach your students now .
not tonight . you ' d better go .
i got no place to go .
<person> .
what is it ?
he wants to be me . or he will kill me .
no . no .
you forgot your keys !
oh . thanks .
three more weeks .
it ' s just as well . will you be here ?
but i can see from your walk that you didn ' t sleep with her . <continued_utterance> let me see if i can guess . you haven ' t slept with her because . it ' s more fun when you can draw it out . <person> just isn ' t as good if the woman hasn ' t told all her friends she ' d never sleep with you .
you ' re right on the money , <person> .
i get dizzy spells . <person> . cold sweats . hot sweats . fever blisters . difficulty swallowing . difficulty breathing . <person> vision . involuntary trembling . dead hands . weak ankles . twitching . fainting spells . numb lips . do you think that ' s normal ?
that depends . <continued_utterance> you do go out , you know .
i don ' t know your real name .
maybe i don ' t want you to .
what happened to <person> ?
as your father knew , things need to be sacrificed to the future .
leave her out of this !
and then out of nowhere , some bright young woman found me attractive .
they ' ll either torture us to death , shoot us in the head , or leave us until the bomb goes off .
<person> , okay . i get it . how long have you been a spy , <person> ?
goddamnit , <person> , you won ' t go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z .
well , sure .
you want something , old man ?
<person> ' t call me old man . <person> ' t you got no respect , boy ?
in a minute .
i printed that up for <person> .
no it isn ' t . they don ' t trust the people that feel this way . but these people are right . and the <person>nedys are wrong . we need you to tell ' em , <person>ny . they ' ll listen to you . <continued_utterance> <person> and <person> are good men . but it takes a certain character , moral toughness to stand up to --
-- you listen to me . nobody , nobody , talks about my friends that way . you ' re fucking here right now because of the <person>nedys . they may be wrong . they make mistakes . but they ' re not weak . the weak ones are these ' people ' who can ' t speak their own minds .
what . ?
he died for his king and for france . but most of all . he died on the end of my sword . as will you .
forty minutes ?
that ' s right .
next time , i don ' t care how sick i ' ll be , don ' t take me back to the veteran ' s hospital .
<person> , i thought you were about to cross the river .
you think bad , and bad is what you get .
that ' s a good piece of advice , <person> .
<person> , woods are metal -- don ' t worry about it -- and the driver ' s known as the big dog and i ' m just saying to turn him loose , let ' er rip , let the big dog eat !
oh . <continued_utterance> this is , without a doubt , the stupidest , silliest , most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented .
yeah well fuck you ! you just can ' t stand the fact that it was my turn .
your turn ?
andlt ; andlt ; my name is <person> . how are you ' andgt ; andgt ;
andlt ; andlt ; how am <number> you are as stupid as that one , but at least i can talk to you . andgt ; andgt ;
her dog , yes .
actually , it was her husband ' s dog .
control , senator . we teach them control .
this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus , new jersey . a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him . i don ' t know where you come from , ms . <person> , but where i come from , you don ' t go melting people ' s cars when they cut you off . you do it the old fashioned way -- you give ' em the finger . but what you presume to tell this committee -
up to ?
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship .
yes ?
you don ' t think there ' s some way you could work with me to try and resolve this , do you ?
he died in a liposuction surgery , right ?
right . now it ' s used by somebody from the juarez cartel , one of his lieutenants . who knows ? every damn day there ' s birthday party . at first i thought they must have three hundred children , then i realized they ' re taunting us . three miles away and we can ' t touch them . ha , ha , ha .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> wait for me downstairs . <continued_utterance> <person> <person> , i would appreciate it if , during the time you are with us , you would have as little to do with <person> as possible .
<person> meant any harm . the boy was curious . i unloaded the gun -
yes , tonight . we ' re going to be -- she looks at his watch .
fashionably five minutes late .
it ' s embarrassing , guys .
it ' s embarrassing . but you ' re all acting like you don ' t care ! well , i ' m not getting paid enough to just jerk around here . i don ' t know about you ?
suppose i don ' t go for that ?
then i suppose it ' d be insurrection , and i suppose i ' d have to kill you . i suppose .
and then he ' ll probably fuck her in other ways . did you know you ' re supposed to put your pinkie in a girl ' s bumhole , <person> ?
will you shut up and help me out ?
first <person> , now you ?
i ' m not like <person> . <person> was crazy .
that ' s right , a tweeting bird . but what does the script say ? ' <person> gets conked . <person> sees
<person> , raoul . i can give you stars , i know i can . just drop the safe on my head one more time .
so they say , but the only one who ever goes in is the high priest . they say it ' s instant death for anyone else to enter .
then why am i going in ?
i don ' t know . but i have a hunch what you ' re going to find here isn ' t anything that can be categorized or easily referenced .
<person> , this is going to take some time , and somebody ' s going to figure out soon enough we ' re not even supposed to be here . i ' m in serious violation of medical ethics .
if she was dangerous before --
she could have hurt me if she wanted to .
yeah .
<person> , what happened to your hand ?
what ? <person> , <person> , why didn ' t you let me talk to her ! ?
she would have just hung up on you again . the important thing is she knows <person> ' s fine .
why do men always want to undress the one part of a woman ' s body she doesn ' t want to reveal ?
how did you survive ?
. so that ' s what the weapons grade uranium was for .
precisely , mr . <person> . in a matter of minutes , the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor . and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
i still got two grand to pay off . and i can ' t see my new salary of seven bucks an hour plus lessons getting it done .
but your clubs are your livelihood .
mom , wake up ! dad barely knows we exist .
that ' s not true , honey --
you ' re an asshole .
oh , and why am i an asshole ?
no . this is on the house .
why -
i think we ' re talking about an organism . that could imitate other life forms . perfectly . it could have gone on and on . it could have become one dog . it could have become as many dogs as it wanted to -- and without losing any of its original mass .
you been into childs ' weed , <person> ?
used to be a young smartass like you . then i got smart with the wrong man ' s daughter . got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble . you know human beings ain ' t always just human -- they got animals living inside ' em too . people give spare change to war heroes not fools . all fools get is pity . may not have eyes , but i see . and you , boy ? the blind man puts his glasses back on . <continued_utterance> you got my pity . bobby hope she was worth it . <continued_utterance> oh , she was worth it . she was worth every black minute since .
<person> ' s up . any last words of wisdom ?
i don ' t think i really have a choice in , that . <person> left me .
she ' ll come back . that ' s why i ' m going to . . to not have this baby .
anybody ever hear , ' for want of a shoe a horse was lost ? ' who ' s going on vacation tomorrow ? <continued_utterance> friedman . st . barts . is that right ?
yessir .

i got a letter from the judge advocate ' s office on you today , fella , you ' re on your way out . they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case . now this is it today .
i ' m an attorney on trial before the bar . representing my client . my client , do you understand ? you open your mouth and you ' re losing my case for me .
this isn ' t about you , <person> . they ' re doing this to me .
they ' re not doing this , <person> . i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi . when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau . i felt this was not an impediment , but an opportunity to distinguish myself . but it hasn ' t turned out that way . and now , if i were to be transferred to omaha , or <person> or some field office where i ' m sure i could rise , it just doesn ' t hold the interest for me it once did . not after what i ' ve seen and done .
no -- it ' s -- her voice is getting thin now , too .
scully --
this is a nuisance suit . he ' s looking for small change . he ' s asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don ' t want to go to court .

jimmy needles .
muthafucker -- there is a god .
heartbreaker , huh ? you let him gig here last night ?
you got no know-how . about indian way . or about jack <person> for that matter .
maybe you ' re not aware of this , <person> , but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods , psycholingusitics , dna fingerprinting ; i don ' t have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers . <person> was killed right here .
why ' d you do that ?

<person> palm , your girlfriend . god knows you spend enough fucking time with her . the guys laugh .

i ' m opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night . we ' ll see how she does with the crowd . she got any skills ?
finding food ? but i don ' t really know how to do this .
we ask questions and measure the answers . when something doesn ' t ring true , a fact that doesn ' t make sense , a slight hesitation , then it ' s off to secondary for a closer look . <person> nafta we had about <number> . <number> million trucks a year . now it ' s almost double . pretty soon there ' ll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .
any way we can do it better ?
are you sick ?
me ? no . i ' m fine .
but . he sacrificed his own daughter .
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it : those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids . your father arranged for your sister ' s abduction . he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program , so that she would survive . as a clone . he had different hopes for you . that you would uncover the truth about the project . that you would stop it . that you would fight the future .
long enough , lets face it , you were right . everybody was right .
about what ?
ambitious .
being negative ' s a lot more work than being positive .
. you make this decision now to be afraid . and you ' ll never turn back your whole life . you ' ll always be afraid . <continued_utterance> . i got a present for you .
why ?
<person> , that ' s a misdemeanor . you go down there to arrest ' em , something goes wrong , maybe this time somebody gets his head <person> , suddenly it ' s a mess and it won ' t end there , you ' ll have <person> comin ' around lookin ' for trouble from here to <person> . you gon na risk all that over a misdemeanor ?
no , damn it , it ' s wrong , they ' re <person> ' the law .
ninety-two . course half hour from now might be seventy-two . these clouds move around a lot . <continued_utterance> what happened to your hand ?
accident .
congratulations , you ' ve just graduated at the head of your class .
you ' re a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
<person> ' t you fucking threaten me -- i ' ll fucking kill you .

well we ' re thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway . i hear you ' re moving up in the world . an associate already . not bad . how ' s <person> ?
can ' t complain . got a house in <person> . <person> treating you good ? still seeing that sexy french gal ?
thank you .
is this your family ?
<person> , well , we ' re not .
we got to get out of here . <person> says anything . this really scares <person> . <continued_utterance> we have to go back .
she had to close her store .
why ?
<person> , well , i ' m getting what i refer to scientifically as `` weird vibes . `` every sensor i ' ve got is giving me strange readings . i mean , the school has had these machines up here three years and they ' ve never recorded anything like this .
well , we ' ll ask around . let you know if we hear of anything .
oh , so you ' re <person> .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
who ' s <person> ?
that ' s president <person> ' s nickname .
you think she ' ll turn him in this time ?
i don ' t know . <continued_utterance> i do know however , that you are very smitten with her .
there ' s a lot more where this came from .
you know what i think you should do now . why don ' t you pull some files . some files that were completed , others that went unsold , and i ' ll have somebody run it down , talk to the customers and get some statements .
people can see .
and that would ruin your reputation how ? <continued_utterance> what ' s that ?
we ' ve allowed this man his freedom . his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial . has he outlived his usefulness to us ?
no one believes <person> or his books . he ' s a toiler . a crank .
<person> is it ?
pride and prejudice .
you still think it ' s all just a coincidence ? all of us here right now , at this particular place , at this particular time ?
i don ' t know . why do you think ?
<person> ' t over yet . <person> is part of day ; separate , but equal . <person> is when you let your guard down ; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark .
difference between you and me , old man , is i see the glass half full , you see it half empty .
since i was five . my mom ' s a cocktail waitress .
how do you -- the two of you -- get by ?
nope .
wan na fool around ?
how you doin , ' sir ? i ' m looking for <person> riordan .
who ?
i would suggest the ones that say ' ultra-absorbent . '
yeah , but which are better : <number> - <number> pounds or <number> - <number> pounds ?
back when i was in that barber shop quartet in skokie , illinois i used to have
you think i don ' t know you held out on the d . a . ? what did you leave out of that testimony ? i can be on the phone to <person> in ten minutes .
when you do this , i swear .
. <person> ' t get all .
no physical evidence . we can ' t prove he did it . we probably can ' t even prove he touched you by now .
god . the law is some tricky shit , isn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> how do you know ' bout all this stuff anyway ?
hey ! <person> !
hey , sport . you winning ?
well that ' s what i ' m trying to figure out . how long have you known him ?
not long at all , but i really like him . <person> , i know he ' s a little different , tucker , but that ' s what i like about him . he ' s a guy . a real guy . he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn ' t always politically correct and he probably farts , too . and that ' s okay with me .
i ' m not from new york , actually . but i ' m very , very far from home .
<person> , you can ' t come in here .
no plates . no registration . serial numbers removed . and all prints washed off by the river . that ' s great . this is turning out to be a walk in the park , do you know that ?
come back ?
the one you bought at school .
like i said , i hadn ' t really expected to use it . <person> , i ' m going through a drawer . i hear a car . i look out the window . i see <person> driving away . i leave my room , and there ' s <person> .
yes , of course , that ' s right . we both have bioports . <continued_utterance> we do , don ' t we ?
i assumed we did . i mean , here . in the game . of course , we might not .
i ' m sure there are excesses and repetitions here , but i believe in the gathering of knowledge and i figured , well , there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices -- and that you ' d help me sort through it . <continued_utterance> i have dozens of golf videotapes , too . and a golf watch .
take it off . all of it . now ! you ' re a smart woman , for chrissakes -- don ' t you know the work of charlatans when you see it ?
turn them back , <person> !
how ? ?
<person> , helena . what a great party .
who are you ?
that i don ' t know . but if it ' s through simple contact of blood to blood , and if it doesn ' t respond to conventional treatments , it could be a serious health threat .
like i said , these are fossils , and they weren ' t near the blast center , so they aren ' t going to tell you much .
so , what brings you here at his hour ?
my new bike .
no great loss --
i need to go out .
do you think it ' s important in the scheme of things ? not just because it ' s yours , or because you ' re somebody ' s brother . because i don ' t really get the impression that you do .
well , i don ' t think . i don ' t particularly think anybody ' s life has any particular importance besides whatever -- you know -- whatever we arbitrarily give it . which is fine . i mean we might as well . i think i ' m as important as anybody else . <continued_utterance> i don ' t know : a lot of what you ' re saying has a real appeal to me , <person> . a lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids . but i don ' t want to believe something or not believe it because i might feel bad . i want to believe it because i think it ' s true or not . i ' d like to think that my life is important . or that it ' s connected to something important .
i ' m all right , <person> . i ' m not in siberia , you know .
did you have a nice flight ? are they taking good care of you ?
hi . how are you doing ? she nods , happy to be working with the child . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been meaning to come in a long time .

yes .
and another thing . stop with this spaceman thing . it ' s getting on my nerves .
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with <person> ?
<person> , hush that noise and get in this house . <person> haste .

but when your sunflowers come up , i ' ll pay you for them .
i bought you flowers .

<person> wants to wrestle today .
the poor thing was trying to tell us that it was sick by introducing the theme of disease into our game .
the theme of disease ? i ' m fucking reall infected ! is it going to crawl up my spine and rot my brain ?
what did you do ?
i didn ' t do anything . does it occur to you that maybe i was wronged ?
my home number ' s on the back .
<person> , i look at a hundred ideas a day . i choose one .
he ' s a moron .
he ' s my friend . he ' s not a moron .
never mind where i come from . just watch where i ' m going .
<person> ' t you think anyone ' s gon na notice that <person> ' s gone ?
off me !

it would take money . there ' s a lot of land , rebuilding the inn , adding ramps and so many people can ' t pay .
do you think old peabody will sell ?
never mind . i ' m coming in to take care of business . how hot am i ?
too hot . <person> ' t do it . <person> ' t come in .

he ' s dead .
i knew this would happen . soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee , i knew thered be trouble . hes just got some kind of influence over her i cant decipher . theres somethin wild in <person> i dont know where it comes from . you got ta find em , <person> .
he served his time for what he did . another thing . if <person> went with him of her own volition - willingly , that is - there aint much can be done about it .
<person> ?
you bet .
is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike ?
not at present , sir . but i think the prudent answer is we don ' t know .
you wan na check it out ? come here . <continued_utterance> first we ' ve got <person> , the psycho looking biker . in charge of transportation and smuggling . controls every trucking union in eastern europe . <person> ' t look too clean , either . <continued_utterance> next we got a siberian redneck , <person> . into snowmobiles and snowboarding . so naturally , he covers prostitution and the drug trade .
naturally . <continued_utterance> this guy ' s kinda dorky lookin ' .
i was afraid i ' d seize up during cross . one of the keys kept sticking .
is he gon na take the stand ?
i really appreciate your helping me out on this , <person> .
i can only hold him for twenty four hours , <person> . without staff corroboration .

a star frame .
my god .
<person> would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? in your world , the lord giveth , and the lord taketh away . but in my world , the one who gave me life doesn ' t have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .

-i ' m not contagious . if that ' s what he ' s worried about .
i don ' t find that the least bit humorous lt . <person> .
it wasn ' t <person> they wanted . it was my idea of how to put the land to better use . <continued_utterance> in fact , they thought my concept so brilliant , that they offered me the directorship of transportation . i ' ve accepted . bring me mr . <person> ' s gun . the weasle trots over and delivers <person> ' s toon . <number> . <person> inspects it . he reads an engraving on the frame . <continued_utterance> ' thanks for getting me out of the hoosegow . <person> ' . how sweet . <person> throws the gun on the ground . he pushes back a long lever on the truck , letting loose a tiny spurt of fluid from the discharge valve . the gun disappears .

they ' re boxing us in with these rules of engagement . if you agree to ' em , and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won ' t stop for inspection , the chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting . they want a war , and they ' re arranging things to get one . if you don ' t want one , we have to do something about it .
how does a man get to a place where he can say , ' throw those lives away , ' so easily ?

one thing i know : i can ' t goddamn wait till <person> gets back !
why does he puke ? he ' s a heavyweight . he doesn ' t have to lose weight .
nerves .
in hope of what ? learning that it ' s true ? ! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms ? !
let me remind you who is the new race . and who is the old . what could be gained by withholding anything from them ; by pretending to ignorance ? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable .
oh , he ' s good .
<person> .
it ' s not loaded !
you heard me : anybody or any thing .
the world ' s gone insane . good men locked in cages , criminals running free . it doesn ' t pay to be honest , <person> .
<person> ' t call me a <person> . my name is <person> .
i knew it was right around here .
me and my friends sneak in on the weekends . we hang around , pick up on the babes , drink some wine , get wasted on killer hash --
right . i ' m sorry .
would you like some iced tea ?
i was wandering through existenz - the new system , i mean . i like it in there . of course , without another player you ' re only a tourist . it ' s frustrating .
why won ' t you let me contact <person> ? they ' ve got to be going crazy , wondering what ' s happened to you . i mean , it ' s not like we ' ve done something wrong . we just ran because we didn ' t know how many of them there were , right ? i think we owe it to <person> to let them know you ' re all right , to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he ' s doing . and besides , i can ' t . i can ' t just keep doing this , whatever it is , you know , forever , not having any idea when it ' s going to be . <continued_utterance> hey , what are you doing ?
she didn ' t have enough business .
why ?
we ' re going to war , aren ' t we . if they ' re doing all that it must mean we ' re going to war .
it doesn ' t mean anything .
well , then , believe it . there ' s no sense not to believe it , because you did it . so believe it . that ' s twenty more . you owe me sixty .
you think i can ' t add ?
there ' s a recipe in a tuscan cookbook there i need . would you look it up for me ?
do we really need another `` recipe ? ''
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me ?
all my things have me in them . i don ' t want you to be like me .
what does it mean ?
usually it means that the sheep took very good care of itself , probably sticking to a high-fiber diet of grass and hay .
maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
yeah , then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day .
speak up boy !
northeast sir !
<person> . <person> steps . <person> steps . <continued_utterance> you flying or driving ?
<person> . i ' ll be back .

a jockey ? you mean , like --
no , but it don ' t matter anyway when you ' re lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i ' m telling <person> about this drifter , didn ' t have enough money to fix his car . and <person> happened to find his gun , and through maybe this drifter heard old <person> got some money stashed away , and figgered he might try to break in and steal it !
wait a minute . just listen to me .
did you get interrupted ?
no . <person> .
this is persian , if i ' m not mistaken .
<person> good . it ' s sixth century b . c . do you like the period ?
-- but he didn ' t do anything to you . and you can not promise a little boy that you ' re gon na --
. i just , you know , after all that religious conversation , i just realized it ' s probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesn ' t believe his life is important in the scheme of things --
smartest guys in the world . hey , you got ta scoop here , eh ? you ' ll be famous .
maybe .
she ' s married ?
last week . a small event , of course .
i don ' t blame you for that .
but i ' d face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains . <person> - - i won ' t be any trouble , because i don ' t eat a thing -- and i won ' t try to manage things , because i can ' t think . <person> ' t you take me with you ?

what was that all about ?
you will become outlaws . hunted men .
it doesn ' t matter where i go or what i do . <person> or later somebody ' s calling me ' outlaw . '

it ' s just -- the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall . so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down .
<person> ' t feel like nothing .
get out of town , <person> , as quick as you can .
ted too squeamish to watch , is he ?

<person> and <person> declined . guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog .
you ' re right . there ' s no one here .
there ' s no one here .
no cabs .
<person> !
i mean , look how different he looks just since high school . it ' s bad enough i have to get old , but doin ' it with <person> around is only gon na make it worse . i mean , i don ' t think he ' s gon na be very nice about it .

kissing you .
what are you doing ?
i ' ll remember you said that .
oh , hell . <continued_utterance> satisfied ?
as monarch of the forest i don ' t like the situation .

i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle . he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble . his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing . and he couldn ' t swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn ' t get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver . i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . <person> ! it just stuck up there and spread out . it was about the size of a half dollar . and that ' s why i don ' t ever eat fish eyes . he plays the guitar for <person> . then stops . truman i ' m not saying it ' s right or wrong , it ' s just the way i feel . it ' s the custom thing i was thinking of . in america we don ' t use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides . we throw away the tail , the rest of the insides and the head .
but you never do .
if we were a team , we could do anything . i mean , anything .
no i do not .
that was fun today . you ' re good . i ' m glad you started wrestling again .
what do you look for ?
we ask questions and measure the answers . when something doesn ' t ring true , a fact that doesn ' t make sense , a slight hesitation , then it ' s off to secondary for a closer look . <person> nafta we had about <number> . <number> million trucks a year . now it ' s almost double . pretty soon there ' ll be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies .

one thing that has been troubling me . that lamp at the diner . do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring ?
faulty wiring .

<person> , help me . <person> ' t anyone owe us money ?
are you serious ? this is the only version that exists ?
security is everything these days . it ' s the only one and its stuck inside and it ' s your fault . <continued_utterance> i ' ve devoted my five most passionate years to this strange little creature . and i ' ve never regretted it , <person> , because i knew that it was the only thing that could give my life any meaning .
i don ' t see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite . not even a sewer or a storm drain .
you ' re sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman ' s body in the morgue ?
what do you want with me ?

what are you doing in new york . ?
<person> and <person> . that ' s very interesting .

meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger .
did you see that girl ? i think she liked me ! she looked right at me .
<person> , i wonder why ?
my daughter does not get raped in blue bay !
you ' re saying that <person> was raped by <person> .
got to be some kind of landmark ; something distinctive .
x marks the spot .
she ' s in love with me . i ' ve got to get some water in the pool . and once a week i have lunch with president <person> to discuss security measures against the sandinista insurgents , but all he wants to talk about is <person> . he ' s worried about her .

that ' s exactly why we need them .
the sandinistas hold the hills , the guardia has everything else .
how do we find the guerillas ?
<person> , sometimes i got ta admit , you come up with some weird thoughts .
<person> interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts , <person> . you tell me <person> , who could come up with shit like were seein these days ?
i can dig this music . but not that singer .
why ? . hes right in the groove .
where ' re we going ?
to watch the sacrifice . the king demands it .
well , to put it in one sentence , people don ' t expect major generals to carry firewood .
<person> , i was thinking we ought to -
then why do you call it <person> ' s ?
' cause <person> used to own it .
what if he ' s not ? what if <person> just made an honest mistake ?
what if he didn ' t ?
well , you talk like a golfer --
shit .
why should i tell you .
because he was talking to me . <continued_utterance> does he know something ?
countries align more swiftly than people , i ' m afraid . <person> and i remain . far apart .
may i advise you ? <continued_utterance> <person> was only nine years old when his father was assassinated . he lost his childhood forever that day . i have watched him grow toward manhood , seen the toll his life demands . a boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man . he is shy , yet boastful . giving , yet stubborn . but most of all , he is not yet sure exactly who he is . the boy who lost his father . or the king of france .
ok . you ready ?
yeah .
<person> , it ' s ugly . even for a game- pod .
i have a terrible urge to port into it . what about you ?

darcy , when you ' re done , take the soil samples to professor meyers in geology . remind him , he owes me .
we might want to perform a spectral analysis .
to replace a goddamn radiator hose ! ?
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half <person> . you know how long it took me to find that hose ?
what do you think ?
a transportation system . transgenic crops . the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus .
even after last weeks terrorist vandalization of the statue of liberty by an unidentified mutant organization , the outcome of the vote was <number> to <number> in opposition to the mutant registration act .
<person> . <person> everybody .

what ' s that ?
<person> , i ' ve heard a lot about this .
sort of shorthand .
the agents who have worked out here say its like going into nam . <person> terrain , foreign language , foreign customs . and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds . they hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here .
were you in nam ?
<person> was upsettin you bad last night , and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me sos i could help .

seventeen years of age , six-two , fluent in french , plays the piano , a champion swimmer , and writes <person> poetry . they stop at the gate to the saunders ' home .
i ' m not familiar with <person> poems .
it attacks the nervous system . people suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities , sometimes one , sometimes a whole string of them . they can ' t control it .
are you being serious ?

i wish i knew you years ago , when my brother was alive . i wish he never gave you up .

abominable .
the men of the city are weak and soft , fat with rich food , intoxicated by strong drink .
salisbury formation . we ' ll charge through them and secure the ground behind .
the grass to the left is taller than we are - it ' s perfect cover .
that ' s a nasty cut you got there .

did your mom just crank call you ?
you ' re a genuine curiosity <person> jankowski . what am i to do with you ? . i threaten to throw you off a moving train , feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway . so i think - <person> ' s an educated man . for <person> to disobey me and shoot that horse , that horse must have been in pretty bad shape . perhaps bad enough to injure my <person> during the show . and so i think <person> jankowski might be a valuable person to have around .
tell diamond joe the animals need more water when the humidity ' s this bad if i don ' t see him before i go .

i told him to go to <person> after we ' d left . though he should be flogged for taking so long .

if we made a trade , we ' d be giving in to extortion , and nat<person> would never trust us again . we ' ll get clobbered in world opinion .
it ' s a goddman trial balloon . trial is the operative word , here .
look , we beat the commission today . you know , we got a little bit of a victory . we split right now and maybe we can add to that .
i know . i know . change in the lineup . <person> , maybe it ' ll help . maybe it ' ll help . you got any ideas for a new partner ?
i know about business being bad .
yes sir . well , so we figured as long as we had the opportunity we ' d do a little rehearsing . <person> here .
because i ' m a cop with a law degree , and you thought my legal-
-because your a thug with a law degree . because i thought by now you ' d be so indebted to this department for not indicting and/or imprisoning you , that diligent , honest discharge of duty would be assured . and i made a horrible misjudgment .
just past <person> .
<person> ?

i don ' t like it here . i don ' t know what ' s going on . we ' re blundering around together in this unformed world , whose rules and objectives are largely unknown , seemingly indecipherable , or even possibly non-existent , always on the verge of being killed by forces we don ' t understand .
did they arrest mr . <person> ?
no .
then how do we make it stop ?
i don ' t know . they don ' t cover this in philosophy <number> .

way to go , <person>mond . <person> , take that to lab . <person> , i want you to go back to base and produce some written material . something that indicates that our girl <person> is leaking information to us . and make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the warrior movement . <continued_utterance> you gentlemen missed that medicine basket . go back through the house , and make sure you missed nothing else . and lay some wire , too . <person> ' s do it . <continued_utterance> that ' s good goddamn work , <person> . <person> the salmon run . <person> ' em run upriver .

oh , come on , <person> --
i just want to teach him a lesson .

<person> , right .

when he was about seventeen , he startin losin his hair .

someone wants to kill me , i ' d rather die looking him straight in the eye . what are you doing here ? looking for a woman a little more your type ? how about that one ?
if this little show is for my benefit , i ' ll take you home right now .
but , last night .
who cares what- . i said last night , <person> i i was drunk , i was stoned . i ' d been bitten by a dog . my wife had left me . how ' bout cutting me some slack ?
why is that ?
my father was executor of the inventor ' s estate and he refused to liquidate it . i often chided him on that account , but he felt positive that the owner would return some day . - some people hereabouts think it ' s haunted . who are you , sir ?
you ' ve been using me --
i ' ve been using you ? !
no , ted . this is an actual emergency . <continued_utterance> i tried to warn you , <person> . she ' s got stiletto heels hidden in those keds .
but you triple-dog-dared me .
i love you .
because it ' s true .
i know it ' s busted . what did i just tell you ?
well , you know so much why don ' t you just fix it yourself ?
would your advice have been different ?
session ' s over . you better leave .
it ' s a grand prix tournament . which means anything can happen . you know that as well as i do . <continued_utterance> they ' ll have to kill me to get me out of that cage .
that ' s what i ' m afraid of .
ok . this is <person> . he ' s very good .
<person> , i heard .
but , in particular ?
i . mexico . you got a bus that goes to mexico ? that ' s where i have to go .
you just pocketed the god damned money . you just took my money and slipped it into your god damned pocket , didn ' t you ?
no . i ' d split fifty-fifty with you , that ' s how badly i feel under the circumstances .
the world ' s greatest talker ?
all right , you little puke ! you want to die ? so be it ! one o ' clock behind the luxembourg !
who gives you the pictures ?
what ' s this , an interview ? i ain ' t that dumb .
you disappoint me , <person> .
<person> sir . <person> -
i hope you don ' t find it too stimulating , <person> .
i ' m coping .
i know , i know , but it ' s so . there ' s nothing to do here .
yes there is .
you don ' t care about me . it ' s the same bullshit you ' re doing . that ' s what it always is with you , <person> . it ' s always you ! the i . r . s . took your house . your furniture ! you don ' t say anything about my things in the house . i ' ve got things in the house i worked damn hard for , and things that belonged to my family . the headboard that was given to me by <person> , it ' s got to be at least a hundred years old . and the hand-embroidered footstool .
what footstool ?
you ' re going to lose that out here .
it ' s fine . i never take it off . not since you gave it to me . <person> don ' t remember .
what does that mean ?
now that he ' s in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . <person> is going to evolve .
myself ?
to hit golf balls all day . when you ' re not breaking for beers or corn dogs or to gather the guys and lay bets on which crow flies off the fence next .
what does he want ? he wants revenge .
<person> ? for what ?
what ' d you expect to hear ?
not native american myths and legends . i ' m with the fbi , <person> , remember ? not national geographic .
<person> how so many people wan na buy carpet on a friday night . you ' d almost think they ' s want to forget about it for the weekend .
well then , it ' s a good thing you ' re not regional manager and i am .
if i really knew you , i know what i would find -- instead of a brain , a cash register , instead of a heart , a bottom line . <person> is shocked at herself .
what is it ?
what are you talking about ?
i ' m talking about the kind of people you hang out with . about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .
and if it ' s unsuccessful ?
incinerate it . like the others .
hey <person> , we got a check from <person> ' s trust for $ <number> , <number> but it ' s made out to you and not the firm .
right . i ' ll take that .
i did . i got there at eleven like you said , right as two black and white ' s pulled up : you were out cold in a gutter `round the block . <person> knock you out ?
he hit me with his car first .
yeah . he ' s a pretty funny dude .
you have any home work ?
how ' s things , brian ?
<person> ' t flatter yourself . i ' m fine . <person> - sofia is great , but by no means one-of -- a-kind . she was a proximity infatuation . <continued_utterance> and don ' t use that , it ' s mine .
the bible . why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles .
interpreted by another guy like my father .
<person> ! you sunk it !
heh-heh .
you tell them <person> .
it ' s simple . bad things happen sometimes . it wasn ' t <person> or <person> . it was all of us . everyone in this room . because we all knew the risks . you sent us . you paid our tuition , you allowed us to go . so to invent a reason for why this happened , to pin it on one person , well that won ' t change anything . it ' ll just make our experience meaningless . <continued_utterance> if you want to judge this man , judge him by his crew . judge him by alice and <person> . <person> and <person> and <person> . in one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us . this may sound crazy but the <person> wasn ' t just a ship , or even a school . it was something that we made , that ' s inside us . that ' s who <person> is . that ' s what he taught us . i guess what it really was about was . the privilege of sacrifice . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t that right ?
uh-huh .
<person> ?
yes , sir . we can be sure we get all the missiles , and we remove <person> so this can never happen again .
is this the chiefs ' recommendation ?
<person> ' t suit you .
how would you know ?
what do you dream on tuna ?
darndest thing , i dream about me .
did you find a toothbrush ?
yeah . excuse me .
we have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on december <number> , <number> . you violated sections <number> and <number> . and concerning a job sold to mr . and mrs . defranco on october <number> , <number> , violations of sections <number> and <number> took place .
what are all these numbers here ? i ' m not familiar with all these section violations .
i have to give this baby to some- body .
i ' m somebody . lem me out and i ' ll take care of your baby .
-previous orders being what ? assign the cop <person> blames for his dead boxing probe to the case that ' s becoming his new crusade ?
<person> out <person> . <continued_utterance> no direct approach on the mother or the daughter .
i can ' t , <person> . i ' ve got to run .
i ' ll bet . <person> , <person> . why don ' t you come by this weekend . we ' ll take the boat out .
with which one ?
all of them .
<person> christ . think it smells like that ' cause it ' s dead ?
i don ' t see any eyes . must be totally subterranean . and those tentacles .
do we have to ?
and i kicked ass . my best stuff . then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition . and i cried .
this is getting you pumped up , isn ' t it ? this is like the world series to you .
as a matter of fact , it is .
just because you ' re nervous about tomorrow , <person> , doesn ' t give you the right to get snippy . if you can ' t handle the pressure , postpone the interview .
<person> , it ' s not the interview -- i mean i am nervous about it -- but that ' s not what ' s bugging me . it ' s . him .
where she lives . in the guest house .
i ' m placing your daughter under arrest .
you see , <person> toppled in with the big duroc .
it ' s no place for <person> about a pig sty ! now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia !
oo-o-o-o-o-o .
greetings ! i am <person> ! i come in peace !
ho-ly shit .
hey , this is a pretty nice place .
no !
jesus <person> !
really ? that was fast .
i ' m kidding . <person> ?
whatever .
not `` whatever . `` it ' s two different things .
so i ' m standing there and you could hear a pin drop . no breathing or snoring . suddenly it hits me that somethin ' was goin ' on that just stopped , really fast , like people are holding their breath .
so . what happened ?
one lousy letter eighteen months ago . i try to throw a fuckin ' case your way .
. hey , i don ' t need your charity .
a man told me to say they took it .
who took it ?
who did you get it from ?
i am just a middle man . i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner .
i have money --
i got money .
<person> . not a very well-drawn character . and his dialogue was just so-so .
<person> . <continued_utterance> do we blame ourselves for that ? the bad dialogue ? or would it be bad no matter who was ported in ?
<person> precinct , sergeant sacker .
i called you before . about the man who keeps calling me ?
<person> . <person> .
<person> , alright , alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world . go get a tail on <person> , and stay with her . <person> ' s gon na show . and i want you to make the collar . <continued_utterance> <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' ll sleep around a little .
well , sure , we can leave it up .
yeah !
-- charming .
i was not charming .
<person> . i ' m cool with everything . you ' ve long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town . you ' ve always had an itch for the good life . i ' m happy for you . this couldn ' t happen to a nicer guy . <continued_utterance> but just for the record , my <person> is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my <person> is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas . you seem to have forgotten they opened <person> ' s family market so they could build something permanent , a legacy , for us . their kids .
i didn ' t forget .
<person> , but he was successful .
let me ask you this : when you smoke a cigar , do you ever pretend it has balls ?
anything against zippers ?
you make fun of me . like the tourists . driving by all the time . some even come into the yard . <person> rude . they seem to think we are quaint .
no . i ' ll take a look at it . who do i have at ten-thirty ?
<person> .
she ' s with <person> .
<person> department is <person> ?
i object , your honor .
overruled .
you can tell j . <person> that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin ' witnesses .
maybe if you did a little less partyin ' that little girl would still be alive .
i ' m sorry .
i know you are , honey . ah , well -- it wasn ' t fire , and nobody bled , so i guess we ' re okay . <continued_utterance> yes . yes . yes , i know . you ' re right . all right , yes . in an hour , then .
the busiest land border crossing in the world . over forty-one thousand vehicles per day , twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot . i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through .
any idea how much ?
i don ' t know . <person> ' t let on we know he ' s written . he ' ll start in i ' m only his housekeeper and that i found out through some chicanery or something .
how did you find out ?
moving along - a typical plastic security card . name here , magnetic information stripe here - and a code breaking microprocessor here . swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you ' re in .
does it work on cash machines ?
-- <person> , <person> and <person> . i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article ! but you wouldn ' t listen to me . what if there hasn ' t been a coup at all ? what if it ' s you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade ? <continued_utterance> and if the two of you are thinking this trade is your ace in the hole , you ' re so wrong . it ' s a deuce . <continued_utterance> and it ' s not just me who thinks that . everyone on this so-called excom is telling you exactly the same thing : make the trade , and they ' re going to force us into trade after trade until finally they demand something we won ' t trade like <person> , and we do end up in a war . not to mention , that long before that happens , this government will be politically dead .
all right , so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look . <person> ? you happy ? so now what ?
it ' s really going to be strange going home in a couple of days .
you are home . but go ahead , finish school , do what you feel you need to do . in the meantime , i ' ll be your point person here on the magazine .
probably lookin ' for a good place to stick a knife .
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate .

objection !

yes .
he ' s not in , <person> .
where is he ? <continued_utterance> i . please . my wife . my wife ' s prescription has run out . if i can call him .
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio , didn ' t you ?
yeah . sure did .
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying i ' m gon na buy teldar paper ? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it ' s time to blow out xyz . you mean that ? i ' m afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and i are gon na have a hard time doing any business .
what about hard work ?
what ? ohhhh . is that . it ? <continued_utterance> honestly , <person>p . do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you ?
gee , i don ' t know . <person> . i don ' t seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite <number> people over to trash my living room .
how does he know who i am ?
he hears . everything .
you knew about <person> and lucille .
i was aware of his sexual predilections .
twenty five pounds .
<person> .
i ' m having some art brought up from the city . the cottage should look spectacular .
i ' m sure whatever you do will look wonderful , honey . <person> beams then goes back to his organizer .
<person> <person> and his amazing resurrection . if only you ' d kept away , we might have met again in a few years , become lovers once more . <continued_utterance> take her to <person> . <continued_utterance> pretty thing . you had her too ? <continued_utterance> i could have given you the world .
not interested .
we ' re anti-social . we don ' t have any friends .
no friends , huh ? that ' s funny , i don ' t know no u . s . <person> that comes without no friends . that ' s cuz u . s . <person> is pussies . they always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see-in-the-dark glasses . so don ' t you tell me you all alone out here , my friend . you bullshitting the wrong guy .
you know how many star acts we ' ve had ? how much money we ' ve made and lost and made . ? silver <person> paid for our new stateroom and look what happened to him . everything august touches gets fed to the cats one way or another . <continued_utterance> he ' ll never change . <continued_utterance> i want to dance .
maybe you should wait for august .
you still got plenty energy for me , baby . <continued_utterance> take a picture , bitch . <person> last longer .
oh yeah ?
<person> ? have you ever seen me panic , <person> ?
i just did . you ' re buying . <person> fishes for change , but more out of sportsmanship .
where ' s <person> ? where ' d ya take her .
nowhere . i ' m trying to find her .
what the fuck do you want ? <continued_utterance> you want some of that ? <continued_utterance> what you gon na do to get some of that ?

you can ' t be serious .
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case ?
no -- we don ' t want this case in court .
neither does he . that ' s where he loses . this man ' s scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
i laugh sometimes
yes , but how often ? tell me , are you happy ?
we ' re doing something -- ?
before we do this , i just want to say that a good life ' s got ta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list . <continued_utterance> it ' s about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know , spontaneously .
that ' s my journal !
<person> ' t get so upset <person> . though your handwriting is egregious , you have a fairly decent vocabulary . although , <person> is not an `` affected twit . `` <person> snatches the journal out of her hands .
okay .
he ' s still a little warm . <continued_utterance> yuck . <continued_utterance> that ' s a . big trunk . it fits a tuba , a <continued_utterance> whose tuba is that anyway ?
maybe we ' ve been going about this all wrong . he ' s down there to be alone so let ' s give him what he wants . we change our focus .

i don ' t know how to even tell you this without being embarrassed for myself . it was an accident . it ' s like one of those things out of the blue . it ' s crazy . you can ' t explain it . it happens .
but that smile .
oh , ted , duh . i smile at everyone since i got my braces off .
why ?
well . her store was very close to our store , and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost --
-- but why ? what ' s the point ?
you always get like this when you smoke .
<person> , what did you get ?

i ' m already on a first name basis with these dudes , i got a deal set up , you want me to hammer it or not ?
we ' re not after car thieves here .
<person> martini .

what ' d he do , buy a porsche ?
i wish ! he just kept psychoanalyzing everything . my dolls were alter egos . boys who wanted to kiss me were oedipally fixated adolescents looking to displace their mothers on their aboriginal family totems .
but the bullseye on your back ' s never been quite so big . if you need a new line of work , i got this faygele leading man needs replacing- <continued_utterance> his agent told me he could play straight .
his agent lied .
<person> , you ' re making more problems than you are sales .
i don ' t think you ' re being fair , sir . you assigned me this guy , and you know he ' s got a history .
<person> , why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game ?
just tell me what you want .
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men , to help a girl whose life ' s not going to be changed in the least ? you know what code blue means ?
' <person> ' .
ah , nothing to be ashamed of . <person> and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places .
i don ' t know . i just ran .
this is flight <person> <number> , requesting permission for take-off .
<person> <number> , you ' ve got runway one , you are cleared to proceed to <person> <number> .
then let ' s bomb the shit out of them . everyone wants to , even you , even me . it sure would feel good .
<person> , i ' m as conniving as they come , but a sneak attack is just wrong .
for god sakes , i wasn ' t being literal ! <person> , let ' s go .
<person> , trust me on this one . call it part of his mental preparation for the open , where the rough is deep , the greens are slick , and the nerves are shattered . i ' ll take the bet .

tell me why i shouldn ' t kill you .
i ' ve come alone and unarmed .
<person> , we missed you before .
i got held up . believe me , it is not something i make a habit of .
the broad has disappeared .
the hospital . ?
that clanking is driving me nuts . <person> ' t you hear it down in your office ?
<person> . i just figured it ' s old .
that ' s weird .
we figure the perpetrator let him out . he ' s blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over .
yeah .
please deposit an additional seventy-five cents . <person> slams the phone against the hook .
<person> . i ' ll walk you to your door .
no , i live just around the corner .
i know .
i won ' t even discuss it .
you are going after mayor <person> .
<person> ' s just say i ' m sending a very clear message to his reelection rally .
not bad . not bad at all . have a seat . <continued_utterance> most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place . i expected you to do the same .
that shows me already that you don ' t have a clue . what ' s it to you , anyway ?
well , the way you hold it is wrong .
why can ' t i just do it my own way ?
general li : my young associate here has just informed me that if i waited a year , i could perhaps receive a higher price for this building . he has great faith in hong kong . as did my ancestors . with obvious results .
. most eloquently put , <person> .
it all makes sense now . why you favored <person> all these years .
<person> .
i ' ve got a great idea . why don ' t you let me call the plumber ?
do whatever you want .
mcmanus . <person> told us another story altogether . fenster t was it the one about the hooker with dysentery i swear , she never mentioned money until i came . <continued_utterance> <person> fold us about the truck . fenster s to be honest , it was more like a + mobile home . she made a lot of money , t
hey , are we talking about the same thing ?
yeah , but which are better : <number> - <number> pounds or <number> - <number> pounds ?
depends how much your baby weighs .
come on - come on - over this way .
<person> .
<person> is smart enough to know you ' d check everywhere in the immediate area . whatever the device is , he ' s probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
you know how much man power you ' re talking about ?
what ' s that ?
blood ?
about what ?
-- they ' re asking her for a narrative . they want to know why she was in the wrong building .
maybe i should let you do this --
<person> ' t give up so quickly . <continued_utterance> thanks .
the doctor is the son ' s mother . feminists pose the riddle to reveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run . i take it you ' re a feminist ?
ma ' am , i ' ve been called a lot of things -- but no one ' s ever saddled me with that one .
<person> : why , you dirty , old -
skip that word .
how ' d that get on there ?
you loaded the songs . you tell me ?
what was he doing in the rec room ?
well , after i worked on him -- thought i ' d let him rest . left the room for a bit . when i came back , he was gone .
why ? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again ?
i was just baiting him ! <person> , i had to tell him that to get his guard down . just like you told <person> you was going to kill me !
some apartment somewhere . but i ' ve never seen it .
that strikes me as odd .
the what ? the sparkplugs ?
you heard me . my friend here has a bioport problem .
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio . i took you home .
but why ? i can ' t understand how i could just completely --
what the in god ' s name has gotten into you ? ! ? <person> paid good money for that trailer !
and just what makes you so sure it was me ?
yeah . ?
why ?
i ' m not supposed to talk . i ' m a statue .
<person> , you look so -- gold . how ' s it going ?
what book ?
something book of the dead .
we weren ' t expecting to find those remains , of course . they went right off to washington .
was there anything in those offices that didn ' t go to d . c . ?
i ' m afraid i ' m a little rusty yet .
oh , dear -- that was wonderful ! you know -- we were just wondering why you couldn ' t come to <person> with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart .
is that any way to say hello ?
i thought your specialty was good-bye .
it is stuck ?
could be .
no . not this time .
well , as i said , you can always reach me . you ' ve got my card , and when the time comes , let ' s talk . <continued_utterance> hey , give my best to your little son . wonderful kid there . what ' s his name again , <person> ?
gone fishing .
fishing ?
that ' s right . she called me . she even asked me what your fathers looked like .
what ? she asked about my father ?
there ' s a red light , i ' m making a space for myself . that ' s what i ' m doing , in order to get into the street . that ' s something ya do !
you came out of nowhere . you bolted out of no place . bolted out of nowhere .
that ' s refreshingly deviant .
what about you ?
you know what else children don ' t know ? they don ' t know what a telephone booth is ?
who are you ?
all right people . new plan . not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan .
i ' m calling the police .
no . i ' d split fifty-fifty with you , that ' s how badly i feel under the circumstances .
you get this straight , you son of a bitch , you owe me sixteen plus . i want sixteen plus .
she threw up in her mask .
. and her heart stopped and she wasn ' t getting oxygen .
of course ! quite a number .
but you don ' t refuse to believe in them because of that ?
you cried out for `` <person> , '' <person> .
no . no .
oh , it ' s nothing -- we were talking about <person> . i told you about <person> .
he the one drives down from the boondocks ? the mechanic ? <person> . what a stupid name . <person> . duhhhhwight . <person>-tah-h-h-h . <person>tahhhhh .

entertainment . the susan lucci section or banal love songs of the nineties ?
i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission .
with all due respect , mr . secretary , we were not firing on the ship . firing on a ship means attacking the ship . we were not attacking the ship . we were firing over it .
<person> .
<person> .
will you marry me , <person> ?
oh yeah , pretty boy ? and what about <person> ?
bloody .
yeah . i ' ll bet . <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' m tired of nicaragua .
i figure you saw her that day in the house and just gradually intuited the whole damn thing . that would be pretty astonishing . a passive-aggressive masterpiece . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t until the shower that i realized you actually believed it . nearly froze to death waiting for you . thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and i ' d be toast . <continued_utterance> the crazy thing is . i have never for one moment stopped loving you . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry about <person> . i ' m sure in some tragic way this ' ll bring us closer together . <continued_utterance> hey , it ' s norman . <person> , we had a huge blowout , so i ' m going down to sleep at the lab . i guess you ' re out , but . maybe . if you wouldn ' t mind stopping by to check on her in the morning ? <continued_utterance> it ' s just . jody , it ' s bad . i ' ve never seen her like this . i don ' t really know what to do anymore . <continued_utterance> if anything ever happened to her , i ' d . <person> , thanks . <continued_utterance> i ' m so sorry .
<person> .
it ' s a pleasure to meet you .
he ' s spoken of you . he says you ' re becoming friends .
weird . got some kind of snowball effect goin ' here or somethin ' .
you ' re still with us though . you ' re somewhere on the face of the earth ?
sometimes , you just have to plunge into things . be reckless .
- and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake .
<person> ' t say that .
no , i don ' t . good men don ' t wind up with much in the end except their goodness . <person> ' t worth much , is it ?
oh , yeah , sure , she ' s in there .
i don ' t believe how much she ' s grown ! <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> , hello my darling . <continued_utterance> how beautiful she is . her hair has grown . <person> how much she changed , i missed it all . i missed her so much ! <continued_utterance> i wanted to make life difficult for <person> but i never thought i ' d miss her so much .
<person> .
<person> again if there ' s any problem .
oh baby , what did they do to you ? i ' m sorry . i ' m so sorry .

<person> , <person> . i was a <number> year old kid . what the hell did i know ?
i don ' t know what you know . why don ' t you go ask your girlfriend about it ?

<person> . now listen to me , asshole . i ' m giving you a break . but if my partner finds out you ' re here , you ' re gon na be reading rat tracks in sioux falls <person> .
what is all this ? when are you coming home ?
just a few tokens of my affection .
the hell with that . no one ' s gon na tell me who i can and can ' t work with .
no , i mean
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder .
that thought makes me feel awful .
<person> ? i want the course record ! now gim me the lumber !
you not going to listen to me ? you don ' t care i ' m trying to help ?
how are you ?
tolerably well . i brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses .
<person> , your links to <person> to <person> , extortion , bribes , murder-for-hire . i ' ll put you in every pair of cross- hairs i can find . i ' ll torch everything you ' ve ever touched . you have no idea how deep i run <person> . and how far i ' m willing to go to fuck you-
-everyone knows i ' m a piece-a-shit . what are you proving ? <person> ' s the guy flanking you right now . the guy who ' s vulnerable right now .

<person> shit , i ' ve been going out with a loaded gun !
<person> .

she ' s looking for a payout , dude . just buy her stake and give her an exit .
what the hell does that mean ?
i want a place where only the vultures will find him . it ' ll be over soon , <person> .
then will you take me on your friends ' boat with you ?
mr . <person> , this is a most unusual motion .
nonetheless , your honor , we feel that our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law .
including all the catholic ones ? because that ' s where i went . <person> for catholic boys .
<person> , fine .

the hand is approaching midnight .
he is looking at his wristwatch .
they ' re cumulus clouds , at an elevation of seven thousand feet .
yes , sir . still , weather ' s a funny thing .
and this is a little above market- rate for the horizontal bop , even for a total biscuit like her .
<person> , i want a complete workup on her . do we know where she is ?
take it easy , <person> . your whole story is full of holes !
stop ! please leave . <person> now .

i told you -- i have a date .
hm . <continued_utterance> you better ease off that stuff , <person> . it ' s pretty acidic .
i can ' t help myself . i don ' t know what ' s the matter with me .
why ?
partly because i didn ' t want to hurt you . but partly . partly because i was relieved .
i have to tell you something . you may not trust me after you hear it . <continued_utterance> i never took my final exams at cornell . i ' m not a real vet . <continued_utterance> but it ' s true . i never got my degree . i ' m not a licensed vet .
bah ! a worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league ! of course you ' re a vet . you have the gift . you ' re idealism is just so . sweet . when are you going to learn that the rules written of , by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us .

my fantasy is a totally naked woman , wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs .
well , you can imagine how much sleep i ' ve gotten .
<person> , of course , ' cause after the <number> : <number> bottle it starts all over again around nine .
if waitin ' tables in a bar don ' t make you an expert on human nature , then nothin ' will , and i could ' ve told you that <person> would end up buyin ' it in a parkin ' lot . i ' m just surprised it didn ' t happen before now .
who do you think did it ?
brian . hi . i ' m <person> -- i ' m the lending officer ?

i ' m certain of it . i ' m not giving away four hundred dollars for my health . i ' m a businessman , and i ' m a good businessman . this is good business for me . i ' m giving it away ' cos i believe in this house , believe that it will refer me to other jobs which means money in my pocket , which means money in your pocket .

what the hell ' s a freeway ?
a freeway , mr . <person> , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l . a . to <person> . <person> to <person> . <person> to <person> . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l . a . <person> to another .
everybody ' s saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father . because of you .
well that ' s just typical isn ' t it ?
i was being foolish ?

you were supposed to stick to the plan . you were supposed to come with us . <person> needed you . i needed you . you were my big brother and you bailed on me . <continued_utterance> hey , i ' m glad you stayed and everything worked out for you , brendan . <person> , you leave , you get the opposite . you leave , you get to bury people .
you ' re not the only one who suffered , <person> . i didn ' t even know she was sick . i never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother . you had no right to keep that from me ! that was not your decision to make !
<person> . i think <person> and i can proceed from here . what are your call signals ?
px- <number> and <number> . anything we can do to help you out , just radio .

<person> .
i just don ' t believe that ' <person> ' is an accurate description of the west . i say no more .
come on , give me a couple of more inches .
you get paid by the body or by the hour ?
i get paid the same way you do . what the fuck you doin ' in sebaco -- this place ' s about to blow . ain ' t it ?
it was just <person> . i questioned and released her .
what ' d she say ?
kathleen ?
just a second .
did you have your child at home ?
no . no . no . no . i had my child at cedars and sinai . and that ain ' t no county hospital . you have to have cash or check before you come in the door .
i know . i ' m just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution .
well it feels like it . i ' m leaving her another message .
if these people lose their jobs , nowhere to go . my father worked at bluestar for twenty-four years . i gave ' em my word .
it ' s all about bucks , kid , the rest is conversation . <person> , you ' re still going to be president . and when the time comes , you ' ll parachute out a rich man . with the money you ' re going to make , your father won ' t have to work another day in his life .
he ' ll do it .
you ' ll not get that one in a harness , let alone pulling a plow . even drunk on a tuesday night , you know that . and i can ' t wait for the money - there ' s a war coming . <person> stands up from his chair , resolute .
i got the money all packed . i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . <person> ' ll think maybe me and <person> went away . buy us some time . i know a back road we can take .
<person> thinking . what ' s all this ?
i ' ll stay at sam ' s for a couple of days until i get set up . what ' re you doing here , anyway ?
there ' s just a couple of things you didn ' t throw out of the house . a couple of things i didn ' t find in the drawer .
in back of the garage .
is that <person> ' s kid ?
mind if i borrow a couple of your tools for a second ?
be my guest .
can i see her ?
oh , yeah , sure , she ' s in there .
until when ? what are we going to do with him ? shoot him like <person> ? because that ' s what he is <person> . in a week , he won ' t be able to move his legs at all .
he has a son in pennsylvania . <person> . we ' re playing there in three weeks . that ' s all he needs .
just because you got ' em to laugh ?
a laugh can be a powerful thing , <person> . sometimes it ' s the only weapon we have in life .
my career . everything i ' ve worked for . , over !
but daddy .
well , nothin personal , but i aint sure its okay by me . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person>or , it aint nothin against you . i love you .
love you , too .
never would ' ve pegged you as a pussy , <person> . even when <person> and <person> called it , i always defended your ass .
<person> ' t no one never said i was a pussy .
knock it off !
<person> ' t get pissed at me , just ' cause i want to be ready when this war starts .
anything else ?
what if she ' d said yes ?
this is america , a different country . i am <person> , a different man . so you see , everything about our situation is different and i believe the pricing will be different , too . you ' re a reasonable man . so take the weekend to think about it . <continued_utterance> every day with this guy is like starting all over again . <continued_utterance> hi .
hi .
then what was it ?
nothing . it wasn ' t anything . i ' ve been on edge lately . maybe since the accident .
human nature . i ' m majoring in behavioral science .
and whaddya wan na be when ya grow up ?
your job is not just to qualify for the open , it ' s to prepare for the open . my job is to help you prepare .
you said to ' trust my feelings ' !
excuse me ?
forget it . we don ' t talk about anything personal . we made a rule about that . i don ' t know his name , what he does or exactly where he lives , so it will be really easy to stop seeing him , because i ' m not .
<person> , well , like my <person> used to say . you can ' t change your christmas past , but you sure can exchange your christmas presents .
why don ' t you come to town this weekend ? we could play some golf , chase some skirts .
you want to go back ? sheryl ? i ' m sorry .
we should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths .
poor <person> . the cold war is over . what have you got left ? economic espionage . <person> in the boardroom . so dull .
oh , you ' d be surprised .
you have indulged him and this is the result .
indulged him ? i have indulged him ? <continued_utterance> he ' s a grown man who makes his own decisions .
yeah , that ' s right . so now that you know , you understand why it ' s important that we get it back .
<person> funny , though , isn ' t it ? we ' re not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway . guess we shoulda played by the rules .
<person> fuckin cut you up good .
you heard from reggie ?
it ' s just as well . will you be here ?
yes .
. <person> ' t you see . ? if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth . nothing could stop it ! nothing !
<person> , maybe you ' re right about this . but we ' ve got to be rational . we ' ve got to talk this over . i ' m unarmed and i ' m coming in .
i ' m from minneapolis . <person> . i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res . so i know about the other world , <person> . <continued_utterance> are you gon na keep that medicine bundle or are you gon na respect its power ? <continued_utterance> thank you .
when you see <person> , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in . the sooner we back off this reservation . <person> ?
so what brings you to <person> , mr . <person> ? <person> - don ' t tell me : <person> marriage ? running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in - london ?
actually , i ' m here on business . you might say it was a . <person> opportunity .
keep hitting on the gas and you gon na dig them wheels into a dirt grave .
<person> yo talk and get out and push .
she ' s insane . is that what you did to her ?
no . i ' m afraid it is what you did . <continued_utterance> when i took her she was . promise itself . so clever , so vibrant , so . full of life force . and you left her there , at the mercy of a man like me . you ruined her . for what ? to get to me ? she is worth fifty of me .
you go over to <person> ' s house last night ? you make out good ? how good ?
i fucked her ' til her nose bled .
i-i don ' t have the keys .
they ' re in the ignition , silly . <continued_utterance> you do know how to drive ?
um . you may not believe this but there are some people trying to kill me --
i know . <person> drives toward the ramp . he looks at her .
we ' re out at the place in palm springs . you should come out for the weekend .

you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
that ' s not my handwriting .
oh .
<person> , honey . why don ' t you take <person> ? he could be our love child .

yes ! <person> ! she lives out on that island ! madmartigan lets out a sarcastic , sceptical laugh .
you ' re suppose to teach your children what you know . <person> , i don ' t have to worry about . <person> is a different story .
you still call him boy . you call <person> boy in front of his wife and son .
oh no . no way . i ' ve had all the bad news i can take for one day .
it ' s about your parents .
<person> give me no trouble now , <person> , please . this aint the easiest day in a long time . and what do you mean how are we gon na know what your daddy looks like ? you seen his photo .
howll he know what we look like ? he seen our photo ?
but he ' s dead .
so ?
<person> on <person> ?
you know another one ?
<person> , i guess we should .
even if they are iraqis probably all they ' ll do is take us prisoner for awhile . <person> to figure we ' re still kicking their asses in the war . they don ' t want any trouble .
i was orphaned at a young age .
you didn ' t have one .
<person> , let me call you back after i wire it , so you ' ll know which office to go to .

you know what i ' d like to see ? meat in a cone . you could put corned beef hash in a cone , or chopped liver .
i like it . and think of the toppings -- cheese , mushrooms , mint jelly
if you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house , blow it into the phone hard , next time he calls . probably break his eardrum . he won ' t bother you after that .
no , i . you ' re probably right . it ' s nothing to worry about .
a group of us are going out tonight .
who ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
you should all come with a warning , like car mirrors : `` objects in belly shirts are flakier than they appear . ``
she ' s in a drug treatment program in columbus . she has five weeks to go .
<person> . can i talk to her ?
our house .
no . <person> ! in the window .
maybe i did . <person> first . <person> cant ever stop talkin bout that town .
on one condition . <continued_utterance> you give me your permission to kill <person> .
er . hum . er . hey , wing .
what is it ?
i made it a contest . the one who does best gets his cereal back first . children like to help . they only need to be kept after a little bit . <person> means no harm by this , but <person> ' s eyes begin to storm .
oh , is that so ? no offense , lady , but i ' m not so sure i like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down !
my name ' s <person> . i ' m a private investigator .
a what ?
oh , please give me back my dog !
certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers .
i ' m talking about dna samples , fiber optics , search parties , they got infrared scanners , fbi scientists . they figure this shit out . they always figure it out .
they won ' t figure it out .

<person> .
no . no , go away .
excuse me , <person> . but when you started talking about original sin , i lost control and became impassioned . it won ' t happen again .
there ' s nothing unholy about expressing one ' s emotions . on the contrary . religion should be experienced in a passionate , all- embracing way . we should feel free to express our spirituality .
. <person> ' t we already paid him for his services ?
yes , sir . but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division . he has proposed an additional <number> million dollar payment .
listen to it . just listen -- he strikes a key . practically swoons . <continued_utterance> the olympia report deluxe <person> . as in gunshot .

i needed to feel alive . i wanted to do something . outrageous . and . i don ' t know . it felt good to be needed . to be trusted . to be special . <continued_utterance> there ' s so much i wanted to do in this life , and it ' s like i haven ' t done any of it . and the sand ' s running out of the hourglass . i want to be able to look back and say : see ! i did that . it was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and i fucking did it ! and i frankly don ' t give a shit if you understand this or not .
yes . i try to keep my power .
one of your secrets .
<person> . i got stronger allies .

no , really ! i ' m just -- rubbing oil on this man .
<person> imam . i have an idea . why don ' t we go back to my place and see what ' s under all that paint ?
you don ' t know ?
that ' s why i ' m asking .
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power ?
it ' s possible .
that ' s not my handwriting .
you ' ve just said you signed it .
oh sure , he figured it was easier to die of thirst ? come on , sombody must ' ve chased him up there .
oh , you mean somebody who ain ' t scared of a twelve gauge shotgun . and then what did they do ? camp out down below and just wait for him to die ?
<person> , you don ' t know what you are talking about . quit trying to hold on so tight . i ' m gone . long gone like a turkey through the corn .
you ' re not a turkey . a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth .
no `` <person> '' . i am the great went .

what ?
yeah , do that . i ' m gon na go rattle <person> ' s cage .
what should i do ? who should i see ? where should i go ?
you have no poetry in you . it ' s about time you went in for girls , too . after all , you haven ' t many years left for that sort of thing .
i ' m the quiet type . little do you know what ' s aged me .
we have plenty of everything .

um . have you thought at all about what i said ?
of course i ' ve been thinking about it .

what i do know is that whatever he ' s becoming , <person> <number> . <number> is going to be even worse than he was before .
that this welles noonan character has developed quite a crush . that you might want to consider relocating to <person> , delaware .

i ain ' t going up there without the gun . end of story .
never would ' ve pegged you as a pussy , <person> . even when <person> and <person> called it , i always defended your ass .
i said poker ' s an honest trade . only suckers buck the tiger . the odds are all with the house .

you ' re a cold piece of work . you almost got three people killed out there .
<person> thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me . <continued_utterance> you ' ve really got me confused , <person> . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew . and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i ' m not following your evolution .
that ' s the name of the song . `` <person> ' t tell him what happened to me '' . <person> . she ' s one of my favorites . <continued_utterance> are you much of a wine drinker ?

<person> . <person> disappointing .
<person> well , but i don ' t see how i am to live with him . my mother values my indentured servitude .

<person> .
i hope we ' re not too early . may we come in ?
you eat my food and you ride my train like you ' re entitled to survive . but you see , nothing survives here without my permission . maybe if you tell me you ' re nothing , i ' ll let you stay , although my bet is you won ' t last . <continued_utterance> you smell like every kind of shit .
times are hard for everybody . and i guess because . out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you don ' t want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight , comes . so much beauty .
metaflesh . <continued_utterance> written like this . one word . <person> , capital f . metaflesh is what our new toys are made of - the metaflesh game-pod , only from <person> research . it connects with any industry standard bioport , which i know you all have or you wouldn ' t be here . . using , however , a very non- standard connecting device which we call . <continued_utterance> . we call an umbycord . spelled like this . <continued_utterance> i guess you can tell i started off as a schoolteacher .

you picked that up on the scanner . we got ta move .
this is turning out great .
what ' s that mean ?
' they lied . ' indeed ! when did they lie ? and do you know what a lie is ?

well , you ' d best get something . even if they didn ' t do it , it times out that they most likely witnessed it . i want somebody to at least talk to ' em . put out an apb with a description and see what we get back .
in what sense ?
in the sense that there is no `` hidden agenda '' behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs .
that ' s funny . i need to talk to you , too . perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room , <person> .
i don ' t believe i know where the upstairs guest room is .

<person> said you ' re not treating him here .
he ' s right there !
<person> , it ' s not just the car , it ' s a total image . an identity you have to go for . this isn ' t some high-tech sports car . it doesn ' t even handle that great . but that ' s not the idea , is it . <continued_utterance> what ' re we talking about here ?

so she hasn ' t changed ?
<person> ' ll come in off the road , you won ' t be there , he ' ll freak out and call you a hundred thousand times , and sunday night you ' ll call him back and , by monday . he ' ll be kissin ' the ground you walk on .

i donandiacute ; t remember . is that what you wanted to ask me ?
i just wanted to make you clear on something . personally , i donandiacute ; t care what <person> wants with you . he can take those claws of yours and use them for barbecue skewers . what i do care about is the safety of this group . the professor is in charge , and after the professor , thereandiacute ; s me . so , for the remainder of your time here , youandiacute ; re going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt .

i tried to warn you in the bar . i told you to exercise control , that it all depended on your mind . all of this , everything is your creation . and we ' re now heading toward your true moment , of choice .
`` true moment of choice ? ''

i peeked . <continued_utterance> it really had the makings , <person> . there was a lot to admire . i ' ve . never read anything quite like it .

officer , i ' m john <person> . just a second please , and i ' ll explain everything .
i ' m <person> , the babysitter seven years ago with the child killer .
i ' ve known him for while maybe twenty years kind of a close friend but hey what the heck officer , take him away , go on it ' s for his own good .
what are you talking about ? <person> ' s right . we don ' t have a choice here boyd . i mean what are you talking about ? what options ? ? ?

you know it and i know it .
what is wrong with us ? . we have everything .
<person> . <person> . so listen , uh , i was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know , with me . <person> looks unenthused . ted it ' s no big deal , whatever i mean , if you want .
<person> , the thing is , i heard a rumor that this guy i like was gon na ask me .
i ' m infected ? wait a minute !
the poor thing was trying to tell us that it was sick by introducing the theme of disease into our game .
in the morning i ' m taking charge of the blockade from the situation room . mcnamara ' ll set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon , keep an eye on things there .
all right . ' cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships , shots being fired across bows .
when did he start sleeping like that ?
about the time <person> left .
<person> ' t worry , i told him everything he had to know , and i made her four bott .
oh , i ' m telling you , that guy is really starting to get on my nerves !
dad . <continued_utterance> so serious .
<person> , <person> is not punishing you . no <person> i know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer .
you were supposed to show up . maybe i wasn ' t .
we were supposed to be together .
what do you say we call in a bomb threat for <person> . i think it ' s free beer night at the astrodome .
now what ?
give me a year . if we ' re still losing money , the reductions stand . if however , we move into the black , i return part of the givebacks , salaries go back to present levels , and . we institute an employee profit sharing program with stock . you ' ll own part of the airline .
are you prepared to put that in writing ?
oh -- oh -- what ' s happening ? what is it ? <continued_utterance> i can ' t run anymore . i ' m so . cs -- <person> and <person> -- dorothy o . s .
here -- give us your hands , and we ' ll pull you . <continued_utterance> . along .
we should go to the allfather .
and tell him what ? `` oh , by the way , we think your son just betrayed the throne . and do us a favor . bring back <person> . there ' s a good fellow ! ''
<person> !
you up for that ?
you need help ?

you ' re not gon na make some deal with that guy , are you ? i mean , i just wan na know .
no , thelma . i ' m not gon na make any deals .
i ' m not going to just sit here and watch you die !
what are you looking at ?
it ' s hard because i ' m a complete stranger and what we ' re talking about is incredibly personal . besides , the first time most people come here , a part of them is wondering if i ' m gon na think they ' re crazy . she sucks on the fireball and slowly nods . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry , i ' m required to have at least three sessions in order to commit . <continued_utterance> now that ' s a joke . <continued_utterance> i have some training at helping people through the stressful moments in life , one of which you may or may not be experiencing . if you want to get some stuff off your chest , great . if not .
these are good .
<person> talk down to me , <person> farragut . i know what volition means , and thats why i want <person> off the planet ! hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby . maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead . youd only be defendin yourself , and with his record , nobodyd fuss .
<person> locate <person> , <person> , and if shes with the ripley boy , <person> give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me . thats about all i can do .
he came to me early today , was talking about money , insurance money . said he was gon na get what was his .
my god .
we are coming out - even .
you mean flat ?
well . i mean like <person> bein in a family way .
<person> tell you shes pregnant ? <person> grins , showing those three brown teeth .

<person> ? ! thing ' s a roller coaster breaks four ways and dies at the hole -- you ' re blind !
<person> ' t that against the law , peeking into windows ?
<person> is missing .
i knew it .
knew what ?
if your jupiter missiles in turkey were removed also , such an accommodation could be reached . <continued_utterance> you want war .
however , while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue , the united states can offer a private assurance . <continued_utterance> our jupiter missiles in turkey are obsolete , and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time . this withdrawal should be completed within , say , six months . <continued_utterance> of course , any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government .
`` that ' s not just a ford , that ' s a sixty-four-and-a-half <person> . ``
what ' s that got to do with the radiator hose ?

<person> , look , many years ago .

technically no . i gambled that you would attend the church service . i just waited for you .
no , you ' re perfect . your face , your hair -- your eyes are like the sea .
my eyes are brown .
looks change .
maybe it ' s because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires , so then can she . <continued_utterance> she can become a child again . who wouldn ' t want that ?
you don ' t scopata one of their girlfriends or something ?
i didn ' t `` scopata '' anybody !
so , we ' re all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . is that it ?
more or less .

there was a time when i would ' ve given my life for a kind word .
please . i have to go .
let me ask you something ? how come you ' ll forgive him for standing you up and you won ' t forgive me for a little tiny thing like putting you out of business ? kathleen looks at him . shakes her head . <continued_utterance> oh how i wish you would . it ' s all kathleen can do not to forgive him .

<person> ! he did . he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me . now , can i go home ?

<person> ' t worry , <person> , no one knows i ' m here .

have you asked him if he ' s married ? have you said , `` are you married ? ''
no . <continued_utterance> i know this is probably a little late to be asking , but are you married ?
yes , <person> . <person> had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit .
my dear , if there ' s one thing the demise of <person> twisp has taught me , it ' s that self worth comes from within .
how dare you attack the son of odin !

say you ' re sorry .
<person> that .

a simple , unstoppable lifeform . what is a virus but a colonizing force that can not be defeated ? living in a cave , underground , until it mutates . and attacks .

the intention of registration act -
then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants !

uh . no , judge doom . <person> here was just about to hand it over , weren ' t you , <person> ?
threatened to blow my brains out ?
<person> . even after that . you didn ' t take it out on me , except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now . but i ' d say you ' ve been very fair . i just think it ' s a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple .
oh , you . <continued_utterance> . you don ' t suppose she could really be sick , do you ? oh -- oh , i ' ve got to go home right away !
but -- what ' s this ? i thought you were going along with me .

pat , i ' m not kidding . i really think it ' s the greatest --
-- love story of our time .
<person> away from me !
whoa ! take it easy . what ' s wrong ?
. that ' s all well and good , captain , save for one thing : there ' s no gold down there .
what are you talking about ? we went through all this and the ship isn ' t even down there ?
this won ' t be an ' interrogation , just a . friendly chat to kill time .
he won ' t go into the interrogation room .
yeah -- no -- i ' ll be there .
all right .
<person> and tell those stories yourself . <continued_utterance> get him out of here !
no . we can still fight !
i said to hell with the budget and bought a roast . i made dumplings -- god , what ' s wrong with your hands ?
it ' s just juice from some chestnuts -- it ' ll wear off .
you ' re still with us though . you ' re somewhere on the face of the earth ?
well , we ' re not in the middle of nowhere , but we can see it from here .
oh look , i haven ' t got time to be proper , i want to live . i ' m a woman , i like men . if that ' s <person> then i guess i ' m not a lady . at least i ' m honest .
well you ' re different , no arguing that . but you ' re a lady all right . i ' ll take my oath on it .
<person> knocked me out .
he ' s having you tailed then .
i don ' t know . the super bowl , new orleans jazz festival . maybe a couple months in nepal .
<person> , and you ' d probably dump the poor guy halfway to katmandu .
pipes ? what are you talking about ?
you jerk off before all big dates , right ? tell me you jerk off before your big dates . ted just stares at him . dom you don ' t jerk off before -- ? ! are you crazy ? ! that ' s like going out there with a loaded gun . no wonder you ' re nervous ! ted considers this . dom think about it : after you ' ve had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed , are you nervous ?
their hats ? i ' m sorry , but when that one guy cut the other guy ' s head off , my first thought wasn ' t , `` gee , what a great hat . ``
it wasn ' t my very first thought , but i ' d be lying if i said it wasn ' t up there . <continued_utterance> now we just need to figure out a way to rescue <person> and <person> .
<person> . he ' s doing it on purpose .
<person> is one of the world ' s leading experts on military strategy . <continued_utterance> well , hell , i just got off the boat . gim me the scoop on nicaragua .
what just . out there . ?
i don ' t know .
aw , leave him alone , he ' s just got a big appetite . am i right ? healy winks at mary .
<person> ?
<person> ' t say that . i had a marriage of convenience with <person> , and look where that ' s lead . well , looks like we got ourselves a contract . bobby do we shake hands ? <continued_utterance> if you can ' t trust the man you ' ve hired to kill your wife . ? the thing is it ' s got to look like an accident ; that ' s the thing . if it doesn ' t , then it ' s no good . i won ' t get a dime , and it ' s my neck that ' ll be on the chopping block while you ' re living it up somewhere .
how do you want it ?
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off , to hide something : bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself .
they haul gas in tanker trucks , they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don ' t haul viruses in tanker trucks .
the women in your time .
up !
-- where have you been lately , <person> ?
-- i know , i haven ' t been --
i guess .
who is it <person> ?
ridiculous . cut him off . i ' m sorry gibbons , you pulled up a shark this time .
i think we should send him whatever he wants .
<person> and <person> declined . guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog .
<person> . he ' s out .
i need a cover . i need for you to pretend we ' re having a scintillating conversation . and you ' re wildly entertained . i know it ' s tough .
i ' ll improvise -
seriously ? i ' m doing all right ?
you ' re taking this bull of an empire by the horns , but you ' re still keeping your small town values . you ' re not letting all this `` stuff '' spoil you .
i can ' t do it , <person> . not when we ' re so close . i can ' t let you ruin everything .
first <person> , now you ?
i don ' t give a fuck about your parents --
we sometimes went downtown to score .
or searing acid !
i ' m not !
mr . <person> knew nothing . mr . <person> rarely t works with the same people for very long , and they never know who they ' re working for . one can not be betrayed if one has no people .
so why tell us ?
yeah , your father was good at all that stuff . he knew everything about the woods , everything about fishing , everything about hunting and everything about cars . if he wasn ' t such a pain in the ass he would ' ve been a lot of fun to be around .
maybe he ' s nicer now .
yes .
you have a record of what happened in the operating room .
you said just dancing .
i ' ll take good care of you .

he ' s an asshole ! ' i heard you ' re not ready yet . ' ' we ' re gon na kick your ass . ' well , we may be behind schedule , but we ' re still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe i haven ' t scored with <person> yet , but neither has he . she ' s not an easy lay , that ' s what i like about her . you know what they say : it ain ' t over till it ' s over . <person> and <person> go into the living room . <person> is picking up glasses . <person> is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket .
and who he is . she has to . i want access to her juvie sheet or whatever arrest records exist . <person> was <person> whored her out to dealers he did business with .
that ' s immaterial .

<person> ' t shoot ! it ' s okay ! friends !
i dont understand this . i dont understand this one bit . he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby . somethin bad has happened - i jus know it .

damn ! i forgot to tell them about the package ! i got ta make a quick phone call .
<person> , there ' ll be plenty of girls where we ' re going .
wow . that ' s too bad . he sounds almost perfect .

<person> , he got her busted for possession .

. i understand .
i dunno -- lucky guess .
well , i don ' t give a damn anyway , i have <number> drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and i got ta work all night anyway . so it was all for the best . but you better not leave that <person> ' s phone number lying around because when i ' m done .

was this all about the oil ?
yeah ?
i think you oughta read it to her .
i told you you could do it .
i was like a different person tonight .
you driving this car ?
excuse me ?
i think you ' d discover a lot of things if you really knew me .
if i really knew you , i know what i would find -- instead of a brain , a cash register , instead of a heart , a bottom line . <person> is shocked at herself .
and you think it helps calling her rogue ?
weandiacute ; ve learned to embrace what we are rather than hide it like an affliction . for some , it has become their identity . you mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride . they arrive at the door to the gym .
having car trouble , huh ?
someone ran us off the road .
<person> trying to bury me too . that subpoena means my fifteen year career with the lapd just went up in smoke . <continued_utterance> hey-

<person> is a patient . he followed me here from new york which is bizarre . but even if it weren ' t bizarre , my daughter seeing a patient that i ' m treating is entirely inappropriate .
<person> said you ' re not treating him here .
you guys , you guys , you ' re all the same . the doctors at the hospital , you . it ' s ' what i ' m going to do for you ' ; but you screw up it ' s ' we did the best that we could . i ' m dreadfully sorry . ' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives .
if i could accept the offer right now , i would . they took it back .
we all do .
<person> . <person> to look for the highest vantage point . from what i can figure , heandiacute ; ll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island . it is my feeling that <person> has to --
they ' re whispering . i can ' t hear them , but i know it . i smell conspiracy . i feel the lie vibrating out of the home .
she ain ' t in on it .
nobody here takes your feelings for granted . we did prepare something for you , based on the preliminary examination .

what does it mean ?
i don ' t actually know him .
really .
you ' ll never hear from me again .
take your time . do it right .
oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ?
<person> ' t even think about it , cowboy !

my friend , if you ' re planning on crossing me .

you ' ve just had it .
<person> , i know .
so that means we have the same parents .
well , i ' m supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement , but i ' m not that honorable a guy . <continued_utterance> i got ta go .
why are you running off so fast here ?
hey , how dare you speak to me like that ! you ' ve never spoken to me like that before .
well , what the hell took you so long ? what ' d you do , go out for breakfast or something ? i didn ' t even have time for a cup of coffee , for chrissakes .
but what if he comes back . ?
we just have to stay in the car until morning . then we ' ll be safe . that can ' t be more than , like , a few more hours . <person> ' s bound to come along once the sun comes up . <person> human i mean . think you can hold on until then ?
yes , and they ' re fools . and you act like a fool when you ' re around them . a prediction : if you stay in concrete , you ' ll wind up working at the aandp -- either that or you ' ll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle .
<person> , and you ' ll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama ' s old clothes .
i see .
i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me .
well . i ' m not really sure why you ' re here , <person> . i mean , i realize i haven ' t exactly been a model citizen since i got here , but compared to how things have been goin ' for me lately , i thought i was doing pretty well . <continued_utterance> and i also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think i need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you , so much so that you ' re willing to disregard the fact that i don ' t believe in any of this stuff at all --
well . i didn ' t mean to discourage you --
i didn ' t ask him to come ! it ' s like i said , thelma , he just loves the chase .
well boy , he ' s got his work cut out for him now , don ' t he ?
but if you ' re watching this , then it means we bit the dust .
but don ' t worry . we ' ll be in heaven . the real heaven , i mean . not that heaven is an actual place , but more like a state of being . or not being . who knows . maybe we know now .
<person> , sir -
i ' ve all these men to take care of , corporal , you can see that , can ' t you ?
the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the bosphorus , cut off the black sea .
but why ? eight million people would die , the land irradiated for a hundred years . a cloud of radiation the size of europe .
those are my private thoughts and are none of your business !
<person> ?
seriously ? did he prescribe anything for you ?
yeah . jogging . why the hell you think i ' m doing this ?
well , i like the countryside .
that ' s good , `cause you might end up spending a lot of time here .
i ' ll be frank with you . this was his mother ' s idea . a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me .

you tell me ! you got a sniper up there or what ?
he ' s not with us , <person> . he must be with you .

<person> to me you left early , before we could meet . but hi , <person> .

technologically speaking , the world ' s out of hand . take the vcr . the whole idea of a vcr is that it makes it possible for you to tape what ' s on television while you ' re out of the house . but the whole point of being out of the house is so you can <continued_utterance> thank you .

<person> ? i was thinking .
<person> ?

the name of the song . `` i ' m <person> ' that i love you . ``
we missed the deadline .
<person> ' t we do it on the phone ?
really ? i ' ve been thinking about it ever since i ate that fruit . <person> ' t you ever wonder what ' s on the other side of the mountains ?
there ' s nothing on the other side of the mountains . everybody knows that . the world just ends . you ' d fall right off the edge .
i ' m over at southeast plaza . what was it we need to get for pilates ?

<person> thing you were there to save the day . come walk with me . <continued_utterance> you ' ve really got me confused , <person> . on the one hand you showed leadership , courage under fire , a willingness to protect men you hardly knew . and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic . help me out here . i ' m not following your evolution .
you want the cheap backstory ? the runaway mom , the suicide dad and the foster homes ? gim me a break . you ' re not interested in my past , you ' re interested in my future as some kind of spy .
about the other night , i ' m sorry .
me , too .
i ' m sure he could give you some courage . mcu -- lion -- camera shooting past <person> --
well , wouldn ' t you feel degraded to be seen in the company of a cowardly lion ? i would .

screw the dogs ! ! torch it ! !
we ' re on fire !
we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development , which is nothing like we ' ve ever seen .

the job ' s real -- you ' ve had is six weeks -- since you got back from <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s all a fabrication , <person> .
this is crazy ! if all my memories are false , who am i ? what am i ? jesus . it ' s like i don ' t exist .
oh my poor baby . how did you get so screwed up ?
oh , mom .
i told you , i don ' t want to be disturbed .
if you want to live , don ' t hand up . <continued_utterance> they ' ve got you bugged . they ' re gon na find you . faster than you can say `` back rodgers '' . and don ' t bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull .
you can call me <person> again . <person> said <person> sounds too pretentious .
<person> is , what , nine years old , what does she know ?
<person> <person> . now i remember . an incredible asshole .
had that stupid best seller , what was the name of it ?
forget it .
excuse me ?
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number . but then you make friends so easily . <person> ' t you , <person> ?
i put up new drapes , jake .

<person> . <person> . we ' re in deep trouble . the package .
<person> ?
my guess is dead .

<person> ! you stop ! youre makin this shit up and i aint gon na sit for it !
<person> , <person> . i probly aint precisely got all the facts straight , but its about what they said .
. what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years ? this is a . why ? why would you do that ?
i thought i would need it .
maybe you ought to read him pinocchio . you told me you were going to turn bluestar around . not upside down . you used me .
you ' re walking around blind without a cane , sport . a fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place .

wha- no .
he was a stool pigeon for the justice department . he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser <person> and had intimate knowledge of his business , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .
trust me , we did the deed .
after the `` alleged '' deed was done , they fell asleep . big daddy lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears casanova sawing logs .
the need to know is clear . what did <person> tell <person> ? that ' s the name of the game . what did <person> tell <person> ? what does <person> know ?
ball park sausages .
i am , really .
it ' s just she ' s been the focus for a while .
i didn ' t do anything . does it occur to you that maybe i was wronged ?
no !
okay , so we ' re going to war . we ' re supposed to go to war . we ' re soldiers , that ' s what we do . the guns , the tanks , the planes ; you ' re just now getting the hint we ' re in the war business ?
<person> ?
i ' m going to work out .
i ' ll help you .
i thought i was driving you home .
you ' re not driving me home because one , you don ' t live near my home and two , this piece of shit isn ' t driving anywhere . now what are we doing here ? why did you get off the highway ?
name ?
he said it was `` thor . ``
<person> , i think we should go public .
that would be wonderful , but it ' s only been a year since <person> died .
<person> of a bitch !
<person> ! now look at what you done ! are you all right ?
. see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . our car flipped on an icy road . we were both injured . he couldn ' t play football anymore . if that hadn ' t happened , we wouldn ' t have been together .
how so ?
locked in where ?
you ' re telling me you didn ' t just hear me banging on the door ?
well , it ' s very good .
i ' ll sell it to you .
really ?
that ' s what i hear . <person> ' t matter . girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .
you talk to im some ? .
some . <person> said <person> promised to have him and <person> out of here by the weekend .
well , there ' s obviously been a mistake . as far as you ' re concerned this investigation is closed . we apologize again .
oh , don ' t mention it ! it was a pleasure having you here ! i hope you ' ll find what you ' re looking for very soon !
you were running with the old ones . at the knee . heavy duty .
well , it was just a dream , i --
she was with me .
you don ' t see what ' s going on here , do you ? there ' s four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas . <person> have been lost . no suspects have been named . so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented . that the fbi didn ' t do its job .
i ' m sorry --
-- i don ' t know if you ' re alive or dead --
well i think you ' re right , i should look her up .
<person> ? are you nuts ?
no .
he ' s the assistant chief of anesthesiology , <person> . he says your doctors , <person> and <person> , put my girl in the hospital for life . and we can prove that . what we don ' t know is why . what went on in there ? in the o . r . that ' s what we ' d like to know . something went wrong . and you know what it was . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . what happened ? the phone rang . someone got distracted . what ?
just banged my head . it was an accident .
another accident ? you got to be more careful .
i ' m a terrible friend .
no . <continued_utterance> how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldn ' t even tell myself ?
this is no fun .
why didn ' t you dive ?
i ' m third in my class .
what ' s that mean ?
<person> , <person> , you should ' ve told someone .
who ?
<person> must be peachy on <person> .
funny you should say `` peachy . ``
how so ?
i went to see <person> about the divorce . <continued_utterance> he was not too agreeable , and one thing led to another , and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter .
dad --
it ' s time to tell him . it would be the right thing .
you ' re hardly nice to anyone .
i ' m sorry .
no . no thank you , <person> . you go home .
you know . sometimes people can surprise you . sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth .
no .
that ' s what i thought . <continued_utterance> <person> , a second blanket . one for me , one for you .
the skinny brunette .
this is where she lives . she wants to talk . beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all . i busted her once for possession . she wound up doing about six months at <person> nine .
<person> , then we don ' t have a deal .
<person> , okay . <continued_utterance> that ' s good coke .
we ' d better check .
<person> , it ' s there . looks a little different , but it ' s there .
cover the <person> buy and put a couple hundred thou in one of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned . pick the dog with the least fleas . use a stop loss so your downside is <number> , <number> , and buy yourself a decent suit . you can ' t come in here looking like that . go to <person> , tell ' em i sent you .
mr . <person> -- thank you for the chance . you won ' t regret this , you ' re with a winner .
i ' ve been looking for you , too .
<person> ' t it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing ?
they came from your car .
i wasn ' t the one drinking .
and what would that be ?
all right , <person> . no more games . grace games ? <continued_utterance> you flirt with me , then you run cold . you lead me on , then slap me down . i don ' t go for being jerked around .
what about family ? like my son .
not a woman i have any use for . she ' s sold me to this outfit when i was <number> .
. he wants to testify . ?
it looks that way .
you ' re wasting your time . i ' m not going to play any more of your goddam games .
<person> , i ' d like you to meet <person> .
<person> . three four nine nine one .
thank you . you are cleared .
damn . <person> na be another hot one today . sometimes i don ' t even want to get out of bed . course don ' t want to get out for the cold one ' s neither . then of course the clouds come in .
<person> , <person> , i ' ve got places to be .
yes -- there --
oh -- here quick -- oh ! - we ' ll oil him up .
dad , let ' s just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore . including the bookstore .
<person> this out . <person> !
i wanted to talk to you . <person> turns and sees cyclops . cyclops storm , would you excuse us please ?
of course .
tug my chain <person> .
after midterms we ' ll finish our run down to curacao . <continued_utterance> i have arranged to host a good will cruise for the dutch students of the local school there .
you ! !
where the hell did you come from ?
we need a vet , sir .
there are no vets . we ' ve scarcely any horses left .
so they took care of <person> .
<person> to the water . the river keeps goin ' down then rising again .
we ' ve met once or twice . last time was in .
county . i was in for fraud .
we ' ll make up some kind of lie . they won ' t find the gold .
<person> . see you in a minute . <continued_utterance> <person> , i don ' t think he ' s slowing down .
that was lovely !
you know you almost got us both killed back there ?
<person> ' s too weak ! we have to convince <person> to pull him , get mccloy in there .
you can ' t take him out this late in the game .
i ' m not going left of those trees . i ' m going over those trees . with a little draw . that way i get home in two . that way i ' m putting for eagle .
you don ' t need eagle to qualify ! you need to get used to playing smart -- no mistakes wins the open .
<person> ' s in town . he just became an american citizen . something big ' s about to go down . i want to know where he goes and who he sees . i want you , sport , to give me the missing half of the picture .
follow him ? mr . gekko i . it ' s not what i do . i could lose my license . if the sec found out , i could go to jail . it ' s inside information , isn ' t it ?
hey , how ' s my little tiger ?
<person> , <person> threw my baseball down the street ; and i can ' t find it !
yes , exactly !
but there ' s nothing we can do without defying <person> . <continued_utterance> no . stop there ! i know that look !
four times , <person> ! that means something . four times .
stop the car !
no . but i mean . just the idea that mr . <person> would .
way i hear it , he was pretty tight with the kids , one of the guys .
no . he was just passing through , asked if he could stay over , and <person> <person> said ' sure thing . ' it doesn ' t make any sense . he invites a strange colored guy in . invited him in to stay . is that crazy or what ? if a colored guy came to my door and said ' can i stay the night , ' i ' d tell him ' get the fuck out of here ' ! it ' s nothing personal , mind you .
you ' re not a bigot , is that what you ' re telling us ?
no , you definitely didn ' t mention that .
<person> , well , it just played out that way . i have to get going .
i ' m sorry , i can ' t .
you can trust me completely .
otherwise whatever we ' re looking for could be anywhere .
basically . but the map has been pretty precise so far . i don ' t think it ' ll be too hard to -- <continued_utterance> take cover ! <continued_utterance> let ' s hit ' em ! <continued_utterance> cover me . <continued_utterance> clear .
who is ?
a lot of people are taking the opportunity to jump on the anti- game bandwagon . they ' ve now heard rumours about what the existenz system is , and they say we ' ve gone too far psychologically , medically , socially , you name it . and i ' m afraid i wouldn ' t put it past our competitors to be involved in this , to try to whip up public opinion and kill our new system before it gets born . <continued_utterance> you ' re sure you don ' t want me to contact <person> , even just to see what they have to say ?
i ' m still nervous .
well , i guess that ' s to be expected .
we played pool . if i won he ' d give you up , if i lost i ' d give you up .
you played pool for me ?
you ' ve had an exhausting night , why don ' t you .
what is it ?
<person> news ? !
sh-h-h-h-h ! ! <continued_utterance> just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy ! !
nowhere . i had dinner with my boss .
kind of a late dinner , ain ' t it ?
any time , any day , a man can completely reinvent himself .
i ' m warning you . this is an official warning . <person> , <person> , danger .
yes , we have a first aid kit .
<person> , see how easy that was . it ' s off-season , park ' s pretty quiet . even more than usual . you may run into a few locals , but --
oh really .
i ' ll grow old . we ' ll both die . and we ' ll never have known each other . that ' s sad . at least one drink for a dreamer . what ' s your favorite drink ?
but you can ' t just send me away ! i ' ve read your book , i ' ve been doing what you told me , but i ' ve completely relapsed ! a little time would mean so much . <person> .
<person> , i ' m driving away now and i don ' t want you to bother me again . you came for my advice , correct ?
that ' s not solid .
you want solid ? that one , single , print he left in the badlands -- the one the fbi missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first . like a white man . <person> has a serious ind ' n walk -- ball of the foot first . the man who murdered <person> walked like a wasi ' cu .
come on ! come on ! <continued_utterance> oh <person> . you ' re no daisy , no daisy at all .
what happened ?
hey to bluestar , as your broker all i can advise is hold on to that stock dad . <continued_utterance> you sure about this faa announcement ?
about what ?
i never finished school myself . never had to . my brother built this empire from nothing but his wife ' s perky tits and a whole lot of gumption . he gave me a cushy job on a silver platter . i never struggled for a second .
my parents always say hard work builds character .
professor tripp ?
grady .
i used to play football in college . in my first year as quarterback , we went on this winning streak . it just went on and on . it didn ' t matter who we played . i ' d always win . you get superstitious when something like that happens . you give things meaning . like you wear the same color socks each game or you listen to the same b . b . king song before you leave the apartment . i wouldn ' t even untie the shoelaces on my cleats . i ' d just slip them on and off so nothing would change . i gave things meaning that had no meaning . i ' m here to make sure i ' m not making shoelaces into something they ' re not again . i was the only person to survive that accident . the only one . it feels like it means something .
are you a religious man , <person> ? <person> nods , `` no . `` <continued_utterance> good . because i ' m going to talk to you as a man . not as a man of the cloth .
everything that ' s been missing .

do you knowingly keep <person> and me at a distance ?
yes .

how about that one ? the host of the old south hotel .
a lot of good times , but i can ' t live off the good times . you know , my brother-in-law has offered me a job at hess shoes . i think maybe i should do it . you get there in the morning , you come home at night . you get health benefits . i get to be assistant manager .
that ' s it , <person> ? you ' re gon na spend the day measuring people ' s feet ? ' you ' re an `` e '' fit . you ' re a `` d '' wide . you got a high arch . i ' ll show you something in an alligator . something with a wing tip . ' how can you talk about that all day long ? <person> , you ' re the best tin man there ever was . <person> ' s a better closer .
he ' s a tourist . member of the teacher ' s union . pays his taxes .
evidently . he had a pair of russian hit men after him . are you still going to tell me <person> is clean ?
how come you go to dad ? are you really sick or just maladjusted ?
sick . you ever had a bee buzz your face that wouldn ' t go away ?
deerfield and choate .
i see . well , maybe you ' d like it . <person> was difficult for me , though -- classes were hard , and the boys seemed cold -- interested in money and social position . and i hated those snowy pennsylvania winters ! but then in my last year , something changed . the guys in my class grew close , so close that i still think of them as a second family .
nothing . <continued_utterance> nothing except three books .
which three books ?
anything you want .
nothing .
i ' ve been thinking about what you said that day . the prayer . about using this whole mess to bring out the good in me .
<person> ?

i thought he ' d never leave .
<person> ? what are you doing here ?
of him i think .
did she say that ?
may have been she just partied too much . but we ' ll look into it . we find something , you ' ll be the first to know . <continued_utterance> it ' s starting , gloria . this is how it begins .
<person> . we don ' t know anything yet . she could be anywhere .
that ' s what i ' m saying .
<person> was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
then what ?
he kept saying , `` let it happen , let it happen . `` then he just stopped .
i should ask this woman out .
yes !
why , you don ' t want us to bring him over ?
no , it ' s that when do you have time to be parents to him ? you guys don ' t pick him up until nine , ten at night . you are into yourselves , as the saying goes . spend some time trying to be parents . <person> him to the mountains , fishing . you ought to let him get to know nature .
if there are any doubts of my loyalty , they ' ll be put to rest when we appear together at your birthday celebration .
i ' ve been thinking about that . a birthday celebration when we ' re on the brink of war .
take your time . i wish i had .
we will .
honey , did you know that the <person> was captured by the germans during world war ii ?
no , i didn ' t .
is that a suggestion ? <continued_utterance> i ' m so glad to see you , <person> .
i believe you . did that nice doctor let you out ? or-is this you improvising again , <person> ?
that ' s why you bombed the building .
<person> our surprise when they began to gestate . my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists , facilitating their programs . to give us access to the virus . in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure . so that we might save ourselves , as the last of the species . your father wisely refused to believe this , choosing hope over selfishness . <person> is the only future he had : his children , the only future any of us have .
nice to meet you , <person> .
you too .
i ' m a little sick to my stomach .
<person> to your stomach ? a hotshot like you ?
<person> , <person> , i ' m serious here . i need some distraction in my life right now . all i do is sit in my condo and think about <person> and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi i paid for . it ' s fucking unhealthy . i ' ve been really kind of going crazy . really .
we start at <number> : <number> pm . <person> ' t be late .
really .
we only know each other -- oh god , you ' re not going to believe this --
hallelujah .
what time did he show up ?
it ' s not puppy love , <person> .
<person> to hear that . i thought the kid had staying power .
lucky guess .
<person> . she left the store to me , and i ' m going to leave it to my daughter .
i ' m just goin ' to see <person> at dawson ' s .
can i walk with you a little ?
compared to the internet ?
my little thing on the internet is just a lark .
i don ' t know . . ' episodes . ' <person> shrugs , spears a fluffy chunk of pie .
it ' s because you don ' t eat .
i bet you don ' t -- big lazy candy hog like you ' d rather lay on his ass and read , wouldn ' t you ? let me tell you something : you ' re gon na deliver those papers if i have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever ' step of the way .
then give me the money i earn !

engaged ? are you crazy ?
why , honey ?
case daddy dont like me . what if he dont like that i dont got his color hair .
no . i want <person> to keep them .
. well ! i do believe this requires further investigation !
<person> , this is mr . <person> . he gets sea-sick at the mere sight of a boat so he ' s probably happy that it ' s being <person> right now .
boys , i need to talk to mr . <person> alone . find your own breakfast . here ' s a five spot . make it a feast .
hey <person> !
i ' m glad he protects you . this is a lethal canine .
. few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me .

last year i ' m number three top seller . year before , right up there . i can ' t get my momentum going this year .
well , you will . you always do .

i ' ll get you a coffee . won ' t be a minute .
you don ' t show for chicago , everyone ' ll know there ' s something going on .
i don ' t care . cancel it .
well , why not ?
because <person> is a loser , you said so yourself . he ' s a goon . <person> is the one . he loves you with that `` lasting love '' . `` true love '' .
. that changes all my plans , i thought you were loaded .
so did i , till i hit <number> and found i had all the royal habits and no throne . <person> got by but i had to go to work just like you . only the skills i had were shopping and making friends . so . that ' s why i do what i do , what makes you tick , <person> ?
<person> , `` dude '' .
what ' s the deal ?
and i don ' t even know your full name .
<person> to fix . <person> .

so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
room service . <continued_utterance> see ? you ' re laughing again . but that ' s what i want . go places and <person> and never look back and just <person> fun . forever . that ' s my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .

natalya ?
yeah . russian minister of transportation .
no , of course not . kind of makes you wonder though -- the guys who built it , did they just die the minute they finished , or did the gods give them a second to get out ?
i assume they finished it , then the gods descended .
<person> , one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now . these people are friends of mine , so i must return and find out what happened .
this island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place .
well , i ' m a little muddled . the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east . and there ' s the house , and here you are , and that ' s all . <continued_utterance> . is , are you a good witch , or a bad witch ?
oh , but i ' ve already told you , i ' m not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly . what was that ? mcu -- <person> looks to r . f . g . and speaks --
ah , she ' s okay .
<person> , cut the crap , what really happened with <person> ?
may i carry your package , <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> .

but i got the shanks --
yeah , and you obviously still have a hard-on for the doctor chick -- your face is all screwed up and tight like you haven ' t been laid in awhile --
<person> , so i was full of shit . i thought believing in things was wrong . turns out believing in nothing is worse . you might as well be dead . i ' m not thrilled with the world , but i ' m not gon na let those idiots start killing people . come on , you ' re a cop , we ' ve got to get these guys .
they left . to a fortress in the mountains .
look what i bought . <continued_utterance> i was just passing this store on columbus avenue and it caught my eye .
what is it ?
i know . and i ' m sorry . i ' ve been consumed with . my daughter left . for school .
this fence . it ' s so .
<person> , that was a little weird -
but that ' s how it works with parties . you have to be invited .
<person> ' s punishment was cruel . expulsion without appeal . or working for me on the school paper . the school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like <person> and we both knew it . but what choice did she have ?
so , <person> . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate <person> at the annual bake sale .
no .
<person> , my god ! you ' re shot to pieces !

hook ? that ' s an unfortunate choice of words .
i ' ll tell him . he deserves to know .

yeah . fitful dreams .
<person> . you had a vision . you got sign from the old ones .
come after me . time traveller i did it to save your life , young lady , which i ' m afraid doesn ' t hold much meaning for you or anyone else . the girl it doesn ' t .

she could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact .
i don ' t get it . <person> ' t they tell you we were gon na be here today ?
i never played tennis . you just travel around <person> -- no direction , no steady work . you must like taking chances .
if you ' re going to gamble , might as well play for high stakes .
that ' s a good start . - now try to tell me . who or what are the morlocks ? are they people or animals ? what do you know about yourself ? the past ? <person> ' t your people ever speak of the past ?

<person> , well , i ' ve been thinking about that . <person> , there was an explosion and everything , but i never really aaw <person> get killed . and nobody ever found the gold . i guess they both could have been burned to slag . i guess . but there were a lot of bodies out on that road . a smart man could have found some identification to use . a smart man could have made his way up to syria or turkey . a smart man could have gotten himself right out of the middle east . a smart man with enough gold . way i figure , right about now old <person> is sitting in a bar in sydney , or melboure , or maybe brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest aussies you ever saw .
yeah . so am i .

for my sin the ground is cursed . thorns and thistles does it sprout for us , and we are doomed to toil all the days of our lives . for as the lord has commanded , by the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat until you return to the ground from which you were taken . for dust you are , and to dust shall you return .

yes . the famous james <person> . i ' ve heard all about you , sir . you were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off , on your own , like some half-assed cia cowboy - endangering the gold , attracting that lunatic woman , and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide .
it ' s past the thinking stage .
i ' d like to know something -- it probably doesn ' t matter in the great final scheme of things . but i ' m interested . did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me ?
okay fine .
<person> ? <person> what ?

how many cows does it take to make a stampede ? is it like three or more ? is there a minimum speed ? <continued_utterance> if there was one nearby i ' d probably ask him .

<person> ?
<person> , we will .
i want to see my son !
i wouldn ' t know . i never imagined this . not in my whole life did i ever imagine this .
you don ' t have to imagine it . not anymore . now all you ' ve got to think up is what it ' s going to buy you .
i just had a breakthrough , and i have to thank you for it . for the first time in my life , when confronted with a horrible , insensitive person i actually knew what i wanted to say and i said it .
i think you have a gift for it . it was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness .
some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water . but that theory is speculative at best .
it was the visit to that god damned <person> !
line up ! <person> file . <person> file . <continued_utterance> everybody swims .

so what brings you to <person> , mr . <person> ? <person> - don ' t tell me : <person> marriage ? running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in - london ?
what does it look like ? we ' re farmers .
he ' s a farmer ; i ' m a herdsman .
<person> out <person> . <continued_utterance> no direct approach on the mother or the daughter .
no . <person> was a battered wife and <person> was a suborned whore . if that ' s not motive , what is ? you want answers then we brace those two hard .
-- you tell the son of bitch this is <person> . repeat , a <person> . and i need a patch of the white house asap .
. the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius . anybody that can ' t make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on , immediately -- gib whips around to <person> , lowering his headset mike .
well , that ' s great , <person> . but it doesn ' t change anything .
what do you mean it doesn ' t change anything ? have a heart , brendan .
it ' s all right . no one can hear . we ' ll never get another chance to say it all . <continued_utterance> nothing can ever happen with us , you know . it ' s too dangerous . august will never let me go . you don ' t know what he ' s capable of .
how can you be with a man you ' re frightened of ?
that baby ' s my responsibility !
i don ' t care . we paid for her . go back to sleep , monsieur .

no .
no , i don ' t think so . leave me alone , give me money . that ' s what i get from our daughter . she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .
<person> , well , she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar , too .
that we ' re going back . i don ' t want it to end . i don ' t want to be what i was when i left .
what was that ?
i want a black one . a little black brother . that ' s a big problem it seems to me . lack of racial integration . that ' s a big one . you think ? <person> looks up to . <continued_utterance> what do you think ?
i think you ' d make an excellent <person> .
nice . drop it in , it ' s on me . go ahead . <continued_utterance> how ' s he doing ?
he ' s doing ok . he can say some pretty funny things . yesterday he told me i was fired .
then they should speak up .
<person> , <person> , you know it ' s not that easy .
no , <person> . it ' s true . you work for e . i . o . so do i .
but why all of this ?
i haven ' t seen you two before , have i ? this is my place .
we ' re new in town .
are you there to not reconcile with her ?
no . <person> , you don ' t understand .
i know what it means .
what is it ?
i ' m really serious . that cop , he keeps watching me .
<person> . forget him .
what ' s the problem ?
i ' m inside the police mainframe . do you see anything ?
your honor , <person> and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars .
<person> !

sax . <person> sax .
i know what i did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much i want that gold .
it ' s all right . i don ' t like it , but it ' s over now .
because you advised us to do that .
i presented you with that option . <continued_utterance> i ' m also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi .
i don ' t know !
you have <person> ' s towel . what the fuck did you do to her ? !
the procedure comes with its own epidural , just like when you have a baby . <person> like instant paralysis from the waist down ? that ' s why it didn ' t hurt you . it ' ll wear off in about twenty minutes .
you ' re looking more like a butcher than a mechanic .
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas ?
according to this tag .
what are you , crazy ? !
you ' re a goddamn tin man !
a cloud passed . or it ' s a bounce off the lake . <person> ? she looks . he might not be wrong .
where is she then ?
are they okay ?
aside from the fact that <person> ' s eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and <person> spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn ' t broken , things couldn ' t be better .
and what do you want ?
. a turner , a perfect canary diaiaond . a lear jet . world peace . the best of everything .
he just broke your truce ! we must act !

i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment .
why ?
i asked <person> about it . he didn ' t own up to it . he said he didn ' t know what got into <person> .
he ' s just raffish . <person> put him up to it . before evening sun sets , i would have his belongings back on <person> <number> , that old fox .
<person> , owner-operator .
well , excuse me for askin ' , <person> , but isn ' t it kinda dead in here ?
yeah . it ' s a fact .
well i ' m real scared .
so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase ? it ' s crazy . tell him it ' s crazy , <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , tell him . <continued_utterance> you ' re out of your minds , you know that ? both of you . you don ' t even know if there ' s anything out there . what the hell are you thinking ?
i ' m thinking about when this war is over . why you figure i ' m here ? ' <person> got tired of being president of gm ? if a brother doesn ' t play ball , or deal drugs there aren ' t too many big money prospects around , and i ' m not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies ' wars . so i say if maybe there ' s something out there , what the hell , that ' s what i say .
hey , <person> , do you remember a virginia couple pass through here sometime friday ?

my mother would never have wanted us to have a website . `` every book you sell is a gift from your heart . `` she always said that .
what if they put us out of business ?
all right . i ' m leaving .
i don ' t have to follow you . you can ' t get away from e . i . o . <person> does .
mr . <person> , this is a hospital , not a penitentiary . everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient ' s folder . whether you can make sense of it or not . <continued_utterance> <person> is a classic paranoid- schizophrenic . they see themselves as victims , and they always blame other people for the way they are . when <person> killed the mandrakis kids , it wasn ' t an act of hostility against the children but against their parents . he was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood . the criminal side of <person> is one of terrible , symbolic vengeance .
assuming he isn ' t found right away . what will happen to him ?
jeff , you want to excuse us for a minute ? <continued_utterance> functionaries . nice people , the schedule c ' s . about twelve graduate degrees apiece , but it seems sometimes all they do is start rumors .

i mean shut up and listen . two guys will be waiting for you in a black t-bird , expecting the dope . just ignore them . it ' ll be delivered to you on sunday and picked up the following thursday , okay ?

maybe , the professor could help you with that .
by reading my thoughts ?
we leave it .
what if someone takes it ?
he didn ' t even say good-bye ?
he just left ?
i was in the middle of it .
i don ' t believe this . after the hartford fire and the hagenback- wallace wreck , that ' s the most famous circus disaster of all time .
when she .
when ' <person> ' . thank you .
there was also a print found in the badlands that indicated diagetic locomotion . heels first . <person> ' s walking pattern doesn ' t match . he has a distinct indian walk .
indian walk ? you been smoking hooch in the peace pipe , <person> ?

<person> <number> . <number> is no longer bound by his programming .
what does that mean ?
<person> and defiant as always , <person> . it fits so well because you ' re obscene .
is that all ?
what ' s the word on the chairs ?
i ' m working on it .
tell me , <person> -- when does it all end ? how many yachts can you waterski behind ? how much is enough ?
<person>dy , it ' s not a question of enough . it ' s a zero sum game , sport . somebody wins and somebody loses . money itself isn ' t lost or made , it ' s simply transferred from one perception to another . <person> magic . that painting cost $ <number> , <number> <number> years ago . i could sell it today for $ <number> , <number> . the illusion has become real . and the more real it becomes , the more desperately they want it .
why didn ' t you mention it before ?
i didn ' t want to hurt your feelings .
<person> <person>er .
`` <person> <person>er . `` what brings you to superior , <person> ?
i-heard .
you heard ? how ?
we can see them , they can see us . we run , they chase .

oh , will you ? could you ? oh -- but are you a clever enough <person> . mcu -- the <person> -- dorothy o . s .
so the guy goes to the doctor for a physical . they do all those tests , all that stuff , blah , blah , blah . <continued_utterance> . <person> says ' when we get all the information back , we ' ll give you a call . ' leaves the doctor . one day the telephone rings .
the guy ?
<person> . i can ' t .
go , or i ' ll kill you myself .
you expect me to think at a time like this ? there isn ' t a drop of blood in my brain .
oh , <person> , you ' re funny .
<person> ? on a two lane road ? with a ton of valium in your system ? <person> walks over to a window . <continued_utterance> i got there first . <person> covered up the pills and i had it out with norman . he seemed desperate not to lose you . he promised to handle it . and we all let it drop away .

now that he ' s in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . <person> is going to evolve .
sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next .
there ' s still a way .
what do you mean ?
it fried some very expensive nerve boards . <person> ? here . these are kaput . it ' s a complex thing .
nerve boards ?
where were you going ?
baghdad .
because that ' s the fruit we don ' t eat ! it ' s forbidden .
why not ?
right . seven o ' clock . here .
thank you .
shit .
i ' m sorry , <person> . i really am .
i heard it click .
if you stepped on a mine you ' d be dead by now . nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore .
<person> ' t surprise me . i meet a lot of people like that .
it ' s not a joke .
well . i thought of calling your photographs `` pictures from a lost war '' . i ' m great at captions -- the new york editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell <person> was anyway -- it legitimized their ignorance , got you a cover , me a feature , and packaged a class struggle in two words . <person> , eh ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> i ' m <person> price .
wait a second , it ' s not what you think .
that ' s right ! i-i-i was just pissing !
we ' ll see about that .
<person> , we will .
you live in the neighborhood , sweetie ?
over there . i won ' t be here long , though , ' cause my dad ' s coming to get me .
ted ! do something !
what do you want me to do ?
<person> , it ' s too much of a tangle . i already cast my lot . i can ' t go <person> and i can ' t sneak , feel back enough as it is .
you feel bad about this ? about me ?
she ' s asian . they don ' t have jews in asia .
that is absolutely not true .
we ' ll pay a little , but not much . - you see , the audience will be guinea- pigs -- and for us , that ' s quite an improvement .
i don ' t know what to say !
shit , she ' s crying .
what ?
no .
do you know why you ' re here ?
what is this shit you ' re giving me ?
this is not -- shit , mr . <person> . it ' s the truth . i know it ' s very hard for you to accept , but you ' re having a schizophrenic reaction . we can ' t snap you out of the narkadine . you ' re in a world of your own fantasy .
if i go out the back , he ' ll know you ' ve warned me .
that ' s alright , i ' ll figure something out .
i read the hospital report on your client .
. <person> .
are you okay ? you look like shit .
it ' s big , <person> . you wouldn ' t believe who ' s in on it .
the other people who were in here lookin ' for the will . i woulda caught ' em if <person> here hadn ' t interrupted me .
take it easy , <person> . we ' ll handle mr .
if that means i know it all , you ' re right , boss .
what do you know about the sphinx ?
eventually you ' ll let go .
and then what ?
<person> .
we ' ve got problems here .
your last chance . give me the name .
stripped of all your weaponry , you still threaten me ?
it ' s a business proposition . i ' m offering you my winnings from all them tournaments this summer .
in exchange for what ?
perhaps <person> had a word with the man upstairs .
a word ? i ' m sure by now he ' s engineered a hostile takeover .
well i ought to know my own mind and i ' m tellin ' you what suits me is a family and kids . that suits me right down to the ground . in fact , that ' s my idea of heaven . all right , what ' s your idea of heaven ?
room service . <continued_utterance> see ? you ' re laughing again . but that ' s what i want . go places and <person> and never look back and just <person> fun . forever . that ' s my idea of heaven . need someone to share it with , though .
i ' m saying it ' s luck . all luck . you work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . where does the ball bounce ? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . he ' s paid the dues , he ' s ready , does all the market research , picks his shot -- `` <person> . ``
pup corn ?
why ' d you do it ?
what ' s the difference ?
<person> ' t mention it .
i thought it was for <person> .
brian , don ' t yell at me .
i ' m -- i ' m not yelling . i ' m just gettin ' a little frustrated here .
what the hell happened ?
<person> developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . if the simulator isn ' t calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of vr is like experiencing death within a dream .
i find it hard to eat when so many are hungry .
your concern is enviable .
how many times have i lied to you ?
zero .
no , forget it , it was stupid .
come on , what were you going to say ?
<person> , if that ' s the plan . <continued_utterance> . here , hold this . <person> , so long !
uh . listen . maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case . so we can find out how she ' s doing ?
what are you doing ? we ' re on your side .
how could you be ? how could <person> , the world ' s premiere game designer , be on our side ?
he ' s just laying in bed . he ' s pretty upset . he won ' t talk .
he ' s dealing with a lot of things . i think he needs to find answers himself .
now you ' re sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply ?
uh-huh . and when we get there , we ' ll be able to find a way to transport you . home .
<person> ' s right . there ' s not enough time to finish plowing . we ' ll lose everything and i ' ll end up working in the mines .
<person> , do you think we should take her to the village council ?
way to go , <person>mond . <person> , take that to lab . <person> , i want you to go back to base and produce some written material . something that indicates that our girl <person> is leaking information to us . and make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the warrior movement . <continued_utterance> you gentlemen missed that medicine basket . go back through the house , and make sure you missed nothing else . and lay some wire , too . <person> ' s do it . <continued_utterance> that ' s good goddamn work , <person> . <person> the salmon run . <person> ' em run upriver .
why we setting <person> up as an informant ?
you never pitied me . thank you for that .
on the contrary , i envy you .
no way .
i ' ll tell him . he deserves to know .
call off the manhunt looking for me . i didn ' t kill the transport guards .
it ' s already been called off . witnesses confirmed you weren ' t the shooter . did you find out where the bomb is ?
neither does he . that ' s where he loses . this man ' s scared to death to go to court . we only have to call his bluff .
i want to settle this thing and be done with it . i don ' t want the archdiocese exposed .
i ' m sorry . but , <person> , women are always discreetly late . it ' s expected of us .
<person> . and the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape .
behave yourself , tucker . come on , what are you doing here ?
i wanted to talk to you about your friend <person> .
couple of eggs over , some hash browns , some toast -- toasted dark . butter on the side , large grapefruit juice and some coffee . <continued_utterance> on second thought , instead of the eggs over , if i ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells ?
we leave them in the shell .
my dad .
it works ?
take it back . ?
i might . have been . mistaken .
boomtown . wide open . <person> ' with both hands ain ' t got time for any law and order . in fact the less law the more opportunities there are for <person> ' money . <person> fact is the cowboys ' re good for business .
what about all these saloons ?
it ' s a crime .
yes . it is a crime . a serious crime .
then youre a member . three or four millionaires in here right now .

i ' m looking for an old buddy of mine , english fella . <person> ' s <person> . any of you guys seen him ? <continued_utterance> i owe him some money .
<person> . show me an honest man .
the goddamn sign on the wall . i can ' t do unauthorized work ? what am i suppose to do ? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket . then you get in an accident and get killed . or worse . who they gon na blame then ? they gon na blame me , and there goes my reputation .
what reputation ? you ' re nothing but an ignorant , inbred , tumbleweed hick .
i ' m sorry for leaving , but i mean , <person> , <person> .
it ' s alright .
no , i do not . i never took cocaine or any other drugs . i don ' t take drugs .
<person> is a drug . <person> is a drug .
when did you talk to <person> ?
talked to her this afternoon .
they ' re ruthless and they have a lot of firepower . it ' s only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy <person> . then we ' re gon na have a catastrophe on our hands .
<person> in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
<person>ed a lift ?
benny .
hey ! what do you mean `` we '' ? i don ' t want to play the blame game , but you ' re the one who hit him .

<person> ' t i know it . don ' t i know it !
bad break .

i ' ve been on a plane for twelve hours , i think i ' ll stand .
i ' m surprised . you are not at all what i imagined . <continued_utterance> so how is <person> ?
i don ' t know . she sent me this letter . but it ' s in french .
that ' s sweet .
well i do .
what ? !
<person> , of all the laws of <person> , this is one you must not break . <person> looks on , intrigued by the proceedings .
what is wrong with you ? what ? you ' re going away . you ' re getting help somewhere .
you can ' t make me .
the numbers are what they are , <person> . i mean , you ' re a math teacher , you can appreciate that .
i teach <person> .
last i heard , <person> ' s <person> was living over in auburn . but that was last year .
must be so tough raising a kid on your own . although i ' m beginning to get the idea my wife wouldn ' t mind a crack at it .
the hospital . ?
no records since she quit in ' <number> . she quit two weeks after the incident .
yeah . your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia , <person> . so sometimes he does things and says things that don ' t make sense .
are you a friend of his or something ?
he ' s got your prick in his back pocket , son , and you ' re standing naked in the display window of macy ' s . he ' s using you . only you ' re too blind to see it .
no , what i see is a jealous old machinist who can ' t stand that his son ' s become more successful than himself .
it wasn ' t a lie .
every time i said it , it was . i never really thought i was going to make it .
look , i loved `` exposed ! '' and i hate it that you got busted . i know the school paper sucks in comparison , but it ' s really not that bad .
<person> ' t even tell me you ' re hot for <person> over there .
nothing ' s going on .
is everything all right ?
how much is a shave and a haircut , <person> ?
two bits .
you promised .
<person> ' t i just give them money ? that ' s the cause ? <person> writers ? i ' m for that . <continued_utterance> all right , i ' ll go . you ' re late .
no you didn ' t . but he did change . just not enough .
<person> , you ' re not mad at me .
because he was worried about me .
your husband ?
<person> '
who are you ?
i swear to god , she wouldn ' t tell me one thing ! <person> ! you oughta try to find that kid that was with ' em .
tell us about him .
i wish we could ' ve brought him with us .
what did <person> say ?
so what does that mean ?
two years , two days , hard to say . if you have any chance , it ' s to stop now-smoking , drinking , gambling , night-life . you must have a healthy diet and most importantly , you must have complete rest-meaning you must attempt to deny your marital impulse .
telling you .
. no . no . no .
<person> girl i ever saw . floats like a bubble . one big bubble .
all right , bubble lover , stand up !
yes . yes . i ' ve been away .
he was killed in the war . a year ago . time traveller no ! . it can ' t be . i ' m sorry to hear that . and the gentleman who used to live across the street ? <continued_utterance> oh , him . some inventor who disappeared around the turn of the century . - if you ' re interested in that house , forget it . you can ' t buy it or even go inside .
what if i kept it ?
i ' m listening .
<person> . let ' s go back .
<person> ' s probably sitting in the bar laughing at us . <person> way ' s the hotel ?
what ?
your banishment , the threat of a new war , it was too much for him to bear . <continued_utterance> you mustn ' t blame yourself . i know that you loved him . i tried to tell him so , but he wouldn ' t listen . <continued_utterance> <number> th blue revisions <number> - <number> - <number> <number> . <continued_utterance> it was cruel to put the hammer within your reach , knowing you could never lift it . <continued_utterance> the burden of the throne has fallen to me now .
the party twins . my high school sandwich . <person> ' s put some meat inside .
she ' s been dead a year .
was it in the diaper , or not ?
the dope ? it was in the diaper , why ?
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
i know . <person> reported your suspicions to opr . on the basis of her report , i sent techs over to s . a . c . <person> ' s apartment . they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas .

i didn ' t mean it that way .
it ' s okay , <person> . <person> , <person> , the others -- they ' re right . my stories are annoying . they go on and on and on , and the longer they go on the more annoying they become , until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
i know . who are you ? <continued_utterance> i won ' t be here much longer . the doctor and his wife are coming home soon .
i know .
i ' m sorry .

since this morning .
what happened to your hand ?
why not ? becoming a musketeer is the fantasy of every young frenchman . or should i say it was . like the knights of the round table , the musketeers have outlived their usefulness . they are a thing of the past . and so have your three friends . tell me where they are , d ' <person> , and i will spare your life .
i ' m sorry . but i can ' t tell you what i do not know .
go ahead . ask her to the prom . get it over with .

we need those flights . we have to know when those missiles become operational , because when they do , we need to destroy them .
get in bed . y ' ever hear of the sixty hour work week ? you ' re turning into a yuppie <person> , you love money so much .
sure , why not , money ' s the sex of the <number> ' s . i never had it like you when i was growing up , baby , it wasn ' t the upper east side .

<person> ' t anyone work ?
no . time traveller then where does this come from ? <continued_utterance> it grows . it always grows .
no . though i have no way to prove otherwise . the virus is extraterrestrial . we know very little about it , except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet .

what in the world would i want with your stupid driving range ?
equity , inventory , cash flow . not to mention an enhanced stature in the community , and prepaid membership in the salome chamber of commerce .
<person> and his wife are taking advantage of a situation . i hate to be mean to people but picking <person> up when they feel like it has to come to an end . now i ' m going to ask him how come he couldn ' t be at your birthday .
<person> ' t bother the poor boy . it just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are .
well , everybody needs a hobby .
no , you got ta understand , valiant , i had nothin ' to do with <person> gettin ' killed . i just wanted to sell my studio . but they wouldn ' t buy my property unless <person> would sell his . and he wouldn ' t . so i was gon na blackmail <person> with pictures of him and the rabbit ' s wife . <continued_utterance> but then it all went to hell . i been around toons all my life . i can ' t sit around and see them all destroyed . <continued_utterance> you got the will in there , don ' t ya ?

<person> .
we ' ll be ready <person> .
football wasn ' t the kind of life i wanted . for ten years i ' d be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . and if it wasn ' t that call , it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . i ' ve seen way too much of it in my job . i can barely take it when my clients are in pain . i don ' t hate the game . i admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , i was in awe of how he could play it , but i couldn ' t give him my heart and then have something happen to him . and it always does with that game . it ' s not a thing many people would understand .
you and my mother would have a special connection .
are you hating this ? ! are you !
i hate you , you son of a bitch ! ! !
i can ' t either . but one thing i ' ve learned about psychiatrists : they ' re brilliant manipulators . i trust your dad completely . i ' m sure everything he ' s done has been to help me . how come you aren ' t making a move on <person> ?
<person> , we ' ve talked about this .
you really are one dumb asshole .
<person> is unpredictable .
please .
you got caught by some boys ?
<person> , tell me about the surprise .
oh , yeah . <person> yourself .
what ' s with the friggin numbers ?
<number> is do something illegal . <number> is befriend an enemy .
how do you do mr . <person> . i ' m <person> .
so you say . nice to meet you ; hope you ' re intelligent . like these , how ' d you get these ? <continued_utterance> so what s on your mind kimosabe ? why am i listening to you ? got to monitor my blood pressure , so whatever you do , don ' t upset me .
if there ' s one thing i can ' t abide , it ' s rudeness .
you fell on me !
and now he wishes to postpone his birthday celebration .
why ?
these are real , live women ?
we don ' t generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine . but hey , if you think there ' s a market for it .
what ' s seems to be the problem ?
you ' ve got to stop the concert ! a bomb is going to go off !
remember when you thought <person> might be the unabomber ?
that was different .
' cause <person> used to own it .
but he ' s dead .
well , it was everywhere in moab , they say -- just like gold in the gold-rush days .
but we were too late in moab , and that guy at the office said nobody ' d found any uranium in salt lake city .
because that ' s my family .
and who are you exactly ?
maybe it ' s harder for them to say it than they let on . at the very least , they believe it ' s in our best interest . and at the end of the day , they may end up being right .
<person> check everything the chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it . no one ' s to know about this but <person> . i need redundant control over what happens out there . and if things aren ' t as advertised , you ' re going to make sure they come out the way i want them to come out , starting with this low level flight thing .
yeah . that ' s the kid !
<person> shit !
<person> meant any harm . the boy was curious . i unloaded the gun -
it ' s not the gun . <person> ' t you understand . it ' s you . what you stand for . that is not for <person> . <person> looks at her thoughtfully . <continued_utterance> please , it has nothing to do with you personally .
you up for that ?
id got to the far end of the world for you , baby . you know i would .
<person> ' t worry . it ' s not a bible . <continued_utterance> my mother made it for me before i was born . it ' s got quotes from famous people . her favorite lines from books . her thoughts .
' what is a friend ? a single soul dwelling in two bodies . ' <person> .
<person> brought up divorce statistics .
the hell i did !

no one ' s asking anything of you !
of course they are !
you know my work ?
dr . <person> , i ' m not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide . i don ' t believe in the elders of zion , the knights templar , the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
bad enough . and god knows i don ' t exactly fit the new corporate profile .
which is ?
probably . but i ' ll leave it up to my companions . <person> ?
we can ' t refuse <person> ' s invitation . it would be impolite .
yes .
and it can be relayed beyond comrade <person> ' s ears to the top circles of my government
really ? <continued_utterance> that ' s an interesting idea . actually , i just wanted to ask you .
at least that way things would have been clearer to begin with , y ' see . they wouldn ' t have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib , y ' know ? ' <person> nothing ever comes out of our rib , y ' know ? <person>r . only out of our prick , and even then . <person>rything still has to be done after that .
and who is <person> ? <continued_utterance> is he a small town boy , destined to live an ordinary life with an ordinary wife and a tiny house with a boring old white picket fence ? <continued_utterance> or do you have a taste for the good life , <person> ? it ' s in your blood .
i always knew there was more . i felt it .
why do you want to have a child with me ?
that ' s not true .
what makes you so sure it was one ?
i can ' t be sure .
you are very important , <person> .
no i ' m not . have you really looked at me ? i ' m short ! even for a nelwyn ! <continued_utterance> why can ' t you do it ? you have mag- ical powers .
she had nothing to do with the tower jump . she ' s nobody . i just met her last night . tell them . i hardly know you .
keep the ring . it looks better on you anyways .
sure you can , no problem . <person> , i got ta go now , i ' m gon na see if she ' ll share a cab with me . you take the shuttle , okay ?
but i got ta explain to you about .
what happened . ? <continued_utterance> what happened , <person> . ?
i can ' t talk now .
where ' s <person> ' s book ? !
that ' s everything mr . <person> gave me .
now , quid pro quo . you subpoenaed <person> too .
how do y-
exactly .
<person> had beautiful penmanship . she was too young for me , but she was .
i call forth the entity that is haunting this house . <continued_utterance> mrs . <person> ?
nothing ' s happening .
<person> , what the hell are you doing ?
making spaghetti .
-- <person> was an apple , that ' s right . red on the outside , white on the inside . and <person> hated him . kicked his ass a coupla times . but he didn ' t kill him .
who did ?
you might say so , lionel .
who ?
it ' s mrs . <person> ' s . her hobby .
i thought you were mrs . <person> ' s hobby , <person> .
in that case , give my regards to the headsman .
what about my trial ?

they have divided us , <person> . they ' re splitting us up .

gim me a sword , <person> . i ' ll win your war for you .
you ' re nothing but trouble , madmar- tigan . and i got plenty of that . stay in your coffin and rot !

how ' re things ? kids are good ?
well --
can i ask you , <person> : do you think your life is important ?
well . i like it . because even in this little town , i feel like what i do is very connected with the real center of people ' s lives . i ' m not saying i ' m always mr . <person> , but i don ' t feel like my life is off to the side of what ' s important . you know ? i don ' t feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people . i don ' t feel like a negligible little scrap , floating around in some kind of empty void , with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies i can scrape together on my own .
well --

yeah well fuck you ! you just can ' t stand the fact that it was my turn .
no quitting this time , you got that ?
can i tell you something ?
just dumb luck . i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me . i went home that night , shaved my beard , and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back .
how ' d you manage that one ?
is this the young man who saved my life ?
his name ' s d ' <person> , <person> .
i ' m sorry but we have little to spare . the cardinal ' s guards were here today . they helped themselves to our food and then refused to pay .
musketeers !

i have to be honest with you , ted . i really despise `` the girls of xenia . ``
i know , their small town mentality can be maddening .
-black and mexican-
-give the man a prize . he ' d also rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn ' t convict . now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip .
not nobody , not nohow !
not even a rhinoceros ?
where is he ? <continued_utterance> i . please . my wife . my wife ' s prescription has run out . if i can call him .
dr . <person> ' s taking all his .
<person> . thank you .

we were on our way to a benefit . but , as luck would have it , the club was on the way , so . we were able to put in an appearance .
<person> , what ' s for dinner ? could we have hamburgers ?
is that all you ever want ?
but he ' s not here .
if he ' s not here , he has a reason , because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body . i can ' t expect you to know anything about a person like that . you ' ve nothing but a suit .
yeah . you in there ?
yeah . they got my license as well .
embarrassment ? !
it ' s perfectly natural for a patient to bond with his analyst . it ' s a normal part of therapy . if you want to be rid of him , simply take him back where you got him and go home .
<person> .
should be dead as well . your failure today is astonishing . it is a disgrace . <continued_utterance> do you know why the color is blue at the wick ? <person> starts to sweat . <continued_utterance> because that is where the flame is the hottest . <continued_utterance> the temperature is close to five hundred degrees .
he probably wanted to drive over .
were you with <person> ? or are you two still fighting ?
i should have gone to the police , i suppose .
but you didn ' t . why not ?
and his humility ? <continued_utterance> <person> won ' t be alone . <person> will be at his side to give him counsel .
yes , but <person> ' s still a boy . he could be a great king . <continued_utterance> . if we only had more time .
why ?
to figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her , that ' s why .
i ' ll be right there , fix them a drink .
. we have <number> . <number> million invested . at this point , we ' re up <number> . <number> million and some change . if it goes to <number> bucks we can clean close to <number> mill .
<person> , yeah . i get the point .
so i see celery , i see the lettuce , tomatoes , cauliflower . and i think , all these things come out of the ground . they just grow out of the ground . they had corn -- out of the ground . radish -- out of the ground . you say to yourself , how can all these things come out of the ground ? you know what i ' m talking about ? all these things are out of the ground .
i started seeing things .
a ghost ?
for the inner satisfaction it will bring . saturday mornings , i ' d like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
i ' m as underprivileged as they are --
you afraid of the dark ?
afraid of it ? boy , i live in the dark . all cause of a woman who made me this way . people are afraid of what they can ' t see . i can ' t see nuthin ' , so it ' s all the same to me . kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . it ' s all the same to me .
excuse me . excuse me ! <continued_utterance> my ex . <continued_utterance> they ' re the only clothes i had that ' ll fit you . <person> .
they will suffice .
-no thanks .
stop pretending you ' re not a pig for all this , <person> .

i told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty- four hours .
well , how do you know i even ate any ?
neither do i . it just flew out of my mouth .
there ' s enough business for us all .

<person> , nora . i . um . i . er . lied to you the other day .
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization , not ours .
that is not true , mrs . <person> . your route is compromised . perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california .
i don ' t think they ' re too good for you , not a lot of ' em anyway .
my wife died .
<person> ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight ?
heh , heh . oh yeah , uh , i .
<number> i ' ve heard that she ' s very sensitive . <continued_utterance> what are they doing ?

that ' s the guy .
this pizda ? never seen him before .
<person> , <person> . i better get on up there .
it ' s probably raccoons which is what it was last week .
i had to put him down .
that ' s a sad story . do you think you could ask <person> something for me ?
okay , i know what you ' re thinking , but i ' m just checking it out . we kept hearing that this place was so evil , but now that i look around i ' m thinking maybe it ' s not all bad . there ' s a lot to learn here .

he sells aluminum siding ? i don ' t believe it . of all the people that could run into me , it has to be a fucking tin man . how come i don ' t know him ?
he wrote obscene words on the wall .
what obscene words ?
my guess is because he let people pay him in beans and eggs or whatever they had , instead of money .
and so he ' s penalized for not turning away people who couldn ' t afford his help ? he was a doctor .
did you do your homework ?
yes . <person> ?
good for you , <person> . you now have exactly <number> seconds to get this rust bucket out of here .

that vibe is from your wrist , pal . you ' ve been over-tenderizing your meat , again .
it seems - mr . <person> - that <person> has told me the most incredible story : a sunken british warship filled with gold ; a british cutter firing on her ; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the strait . <continued_utterance> obviously , the british government denies all of this -

it ' s the same . no one is going to break up our act .
<person> ' t there one you prefer over the other ?
i say , this is outright rude of the man !
he ' s undoubtedly been detained . that ' s all .
<person> , well , she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar , too .
i ' m not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello .

<person> , like they got a plan .
<person> there , <person> . what do you want us to do ?
yeah , i understand . wes doesn ' t want to come along in the first place , but he gets a third of the find . that ' s a sweet deal .
i ' m getting tired of you riding me , <person> .
the school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable . my award winning expos changed all that . the city added an extra weekday trash pick-up .

it ' s a lot of world for one man . you sure that ' s not wishful thinking , you wishing
that ' s just it . i think i <continued_utterance> sometimes i think it ' s in my head , sometimes i think it ' s for real .
why not ?
because i ' m the mother , and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life ' til you ' re eighteen . seriously , we ' ve got no money . i can ' t buy you the moccasins .
no .
i mean , i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- i was pretty bent in general .
he wanted me to live .
why did he want you to live ? a one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple ? no , sir . why '
his agent lied .
you interested ?
what do you mean `` you think so ? ''
yeah . i got it . pretty mean frostbite .
fuck off .
where ' s the love gone , <person> ?
maybe they smell a wolf .
go up there and take a look .
what ? why ?
clearing everyone out ! it ' s been rumored for months .
<person> is missing .
how long ?
i ' ll put everything back , nobody ' s the wiser .
you work for the commission , is that it ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t the commission have enough information ? they got to send out guys like you to spy ?
you ' ve got an awful lot of orders in you . always giving orders .
i out rank you , that ' s why .
and if he rests ?
you ' ll lose him anyway . i ' m sorry .
two is good . three is very good .
four is pretty good ?
what . ?
important business .
you like ice cream ?
yes .
<person> , eh ? so what about dinner and we can talk about `us ' and if we have a future and how to drop that horse ' s ass boyfriend of yours --
roy , slow down --
must be a mistake .
says here you ' ve listened to it <number> times . <continued_utterance> is this true ? have you always wanted to be a cowboy ? <continued_utterance> you also got `` men without hats '' greatest hits ? i didn ' t know they qualified for a greatest hits album . can you break me off a little `` <person> '' ?
when nobody ' s looking . <continued_utterance> you just worry about yourself , <person> . <person> ?
<person> .
one . <continued_utterance> i must say , <person> , capitalism seems to be treating you well .
i used to sell weapons ; now i buy votes . off the record .
that ' s right . i do , don ' t i ?
so why do you wan na go ?
baggage stock horses . they pack ' em in <number> a car .
how do you stand the smell ?
<person> ' s signature will be on the treaty by morning .
the king ' s birthday celebration . ?
now how ' d he figure that out ?
he say he is no ' afraid , someone <person> revenge for him . a sick <person> .
see , i used to play a real weak grip . but you look at couples , he ' s got a left hand way over here .
no , grip it like this , so you ' re holding on with the last two fingers of your left hand .
i don ' t know what to say .
tell her the truth about <person> ! blow the schmuck out of the water .
you sonofabitch . how could you let them put the implant in my head ? how ?
he didn ' t know about the neural toxin . i did .
youre terrible crude sometimes , sailor , you know ?
i cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth .
i wasn ' t in the corps .
then you ain ' t no brother to me . my brother was in the corps .
trust that boy . we ' re not watching the sea .
why would we ?
wait a minute ! just hold on ! <person> , what was him ? what are you talking about ?
that man . <person> . he ' s home again ! he ' s got our children !
i did .
why ?
nah . i ' m . i ' m nothing .
oh . well i am .
how did you know my name ?
excuse me ?
you what ? a wire transfer of this size ?
if it means getting <person> back , absolutely .
what are you talking about ? <person> didn ' t kill anybody .
you want to see .
. if you ' re trolling around for narcs , man , have you got the wrong guy .
why is that ?
just a couple of finishing touches . my parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression .
they said that ? really ? oh , your parents . the nelson ' s . <person> , right . how midwest . i like that .
never run a company . stay an artist . stay an arms dealer .
oh please . <person> , i can ' t play the violin for you . although . it must be hard controlling all those people ' s lives . <person> at that party is connected to you for survival in some way , it seems . <continued_utterance> ever been married ?
i know , <person> , i appointed him .
<person> , well that hardly qualifies him to be <person> ' s guardian . what ' s the motivation here ?
uh no . i think i ' m gon na get out while i ' m ahead .
ted . you ' re not that far ahead .
that ' s fine , but - even a little london girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing .
was he carrying anything ? <continued_utterance> search him . <continued_utterance> do i have to do everything around here ?
tanner to <number> , do you read ?
<person> and clear . i have to speak to m .
no , you did fine .
i ' m afraid that ' s not true . will you want me to stay on till monday ?
oh , i am surprised , you seem like a very religious person .
you ' re kidding , right ?
no there isn ' t , man ! it ' s narrow . it ' s dull . it ' s a dull , narrow town full of dull , narrow people who don ' t know anything except . what things are like right around here . they have no perspective whatsoever . no scope . they might as well be living in the nineteenth century because they have no idea what ' s going on , and if you try to tell ' em that , they wan na fuckin ' kill you .
what are you talking about ?
you lost ?
i blew the eight ball .
i ' m attracted to women .
i don ' t even know what that means .
<person> ! a pair of german cutters - in memory of your handsome friend from dusseldorf .
thanks . <continued_utterance> i ' ll use `em back in the garden in south shields . you keep your head down , now , <person> me lad !
it ' s more than that , <person> , i know it ' s more . somehow it ' s connected .
maybe there ' s a way you can get your memory back .
just listen to what <person> did to <person> ! she --
<person> , please ! we ' re trying to count !
the address ? !
<person> .
you are aware of the penalties for perjury . ?
it ' s a crime .
that would make an issue of something that ain ' t an issue . besides , i ' m focused . <continued_utterance> i mean , this is my quest !
ahhh . your quest . chingaso .
i thought we were dead .
<person> , well , we ' re not .
inside .
and the jacket ?
forget charts ! we ' re not fund managers , <person> , churn ' em and burn ' em . i ' m offering you the knicks and chicks . <person> save you before you turn into poor steeples over there .
. preferably <person> .
hey , <person> . if you ' re really interested in discussing that business with the tango , try the guy at the end of the hall . <person> nods -- puzzled -- then goes . grady smirks . <continued_utterance> he cribbed that from borges .
it beats ' what ' s your major ? '
i hear the humming . <person> electricity .
maybe . maybe not .
what does she look like ?
pretty . she ' s a blond .
now who are we talking about ?
<person> ' s boy , <person> , to start with . the <person> ' s <person> was another one .
goddamn fare wars are murdering us . had to lay off five guys . nothing i could do . what is it . money ?
<person> , it is . in fact i ' m doing great . new client . <person> new league . it ' s starting to happen <person> . the big leagues ! you know what i ' m saying .
she ' s gone .
what ?
i walked in on my parents one time . it was only like eight o ' clock and they were in bed and i thought that was kinda weird so i just walked in .
that ' s what they get for not locking the door .
you actually think you ' re the `` <person> <person> ? '' oh , all this time i thought it was an act ! hey , guys ! look ! it ' s the real <person> <person> !
you ' re mocking me , aren ' t you ?
a woman ? this is not a woman . this is my wife you ivy league lying piece of shit ! say , i bet the authorities would like to know you practise without a license .
<person> , please . <person> ' t you see how much i love you ?
could my house be the ' after ' in life magazine and you get another house for the ' before . '
you mean have your house as the ' after ' and find another house that looks like your house for the ' before ' ?
<person> ?
it ' s <person> . i forgot <person> . <continued_utterance> my fish .
and you were running . what made you stop ?
you ' re interested in judy , aren ' t you ?
damn it ! they ' ll sink this rig just like a boat !
see that ? they ' re doing it now ! they try it every time we hold still .
as i remember , no sale was made concerning those customers .
it fell out because a loan couldn ' t be arranged , but the people did agree in principle . the point that we ' d like to stress , is that you misled these people . told them the job was free . then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown , and a sale was ultimately made for twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars . that is misleading and deceptive sales practice .
<person> . you had a vision . you got sign from the old ones .
what the hell do you want me to do ? !
<person> . an acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in denver that i just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado . yes sir .
no , i ' m holding for <person> . in chairs . <person> . <person> .
i ' ll put this right through your head .
you guys going to let him give orders ? i mean he could be one of those things .
there ' s no other word for it .
who did you break up with ?
what ' s the point of chancing it , <person> ? we ' ll let you take the credit .
no . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to kill him , <person> . <continued_utterance> the closer i get to this guy , the more i . it gets to me . i don ' t know .
<person> ! <person> these men ! escort them to the cutter !
wait a minute -
depends . are you a lawyer ?
no .
i graduated from college . did great , summa cum laude and all . and i ' m about to launch a brand new magazine called `` exposed ! '' an homage to miss <person> conroy of xenia , ohio .
i know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief .
you weren ' t sent here to go off on your own detail , <person> . you were sent here to assist in a selective operations <person> . these regional agents are inept -- that ' s why they were sent out here to the graveyard , to indian country . i need you behind me , <person> . not pulling against me .
i ' m not trying to pull against you , <person> . i ' ve just been having nightmares about the way <person> was killed .
<person> ' t tonight the night you are going to do it with <person> ?
<person> , aren ' t you going to fix me a drink ? <continued_utterance> where are the cookies ?
but those notations stop . . four-and-one-half minutes after <person> ' s .
we , we were rather busy .
what ' s the matter ?
oh my gosh .
it ' s your car . these are all your cars .
some of them have to be automatics .
did you all take stupid pills this morning ? ! have you forgotten what he did to <person> ? and now you want to let him back over here ?
no , no , no ! you got it all wrong , <person> . <person> is fine ! <person> is right here . he ' s with me !
. when you work with clients on machines , do they sometimes just jump up a level or two ? do something they didn ' t know they were capable of ?
not often , but it is possible . most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . they don ' t know how long the shadow really is . they don ' t know how far away the real limits are standing . they stop out of fear . <continued_utterance> this is kind of strange isn ' t it ? <continued_utterance> we ' re not even acting like ourselves . <continued_utterance> like that . your mouth ' s dirty . you tapped your napkin to your lips . you only do that when you ' re with someone you don ' t know .
<person> , i got a problem .
oh . how can i help ?
<person> , this guy owes me a big one . a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office ; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven ' t all done that . <person> , they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk .
his mother ?
no ! no , no , no , no !
you murdering dog !
i ' ve seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it , screaming , into a bottle . the bilges are full of them .
what do you mean ?
its just another case , sailor .
whats that , peanut ?
about a year ago .
he dropped <person> off first ?
she retained me last week to help sort out her father ' s situation .
last week ? i thought she just arrived two days ago . <continued_utterance> how long have you been here ?
fairways and greens , <person> . and don ' t forget to wave as i blow by .
you mean blow up ? like you always do ? and <person> moves to the tee .
<person> for the sky ! !
huh ?
-- an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of intimidation . i know that .
<person> . thank you .
more like <person> is after every man she sees . flo you pay <person> no mind . he just likes to show off for his girl . give him a couple of hours , he ' ll cool off . still want that beer ? bobby i ' ll take it to go .
how ' s it with you , <person> ?
she ' s going to wash your jeep ?
senior class fund-raising gig . i told ' em they could hose down the jeep . hey , come on . it ' s for a good cause .
what do you get if you finish ?
nothing , really . my guy is just doing it to stay alive .
just his instincts . he was well trained by e . i . o . maybe the memory cap ' s fractured . portions of his prior identity could be leaking through .
he ' ll remember <person> ? the sphinx project ?
shoot him ? like with a gun ?
yes .
<person> left .
<person> says hello . he told me you weren ' t feeling well .
brindisi versus <person> .
you got a good memory , franky .
something i couldn ' t show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i ' d just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i ' ve never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
how was it contracted ?
you have changed , <person> .
i ' m sorry . filby will you answer me one question honestly ? <continued_utterance> i ' ll try .
<person> ? open up . open the door . please . <person> , i have to talk to your daught --
what is your problem ?
yes .
<person> for my parents , the tent , the band , the judge .
<person> ?
what ?
oh , <person> .
oh , <person> !
he ' s a school teacher down in philly . <continued_utterance> remember tess ? they ' ve got two beautiful little girls .
so you found <person> , huh ? that ' s awesome . <person> kept calling for him , but he wasn ' t around . i guess <person> was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks . who knew ? <continued_utterance> so , you gon na ask about her , or you just gon na sit there all sober ?
a present .
i hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that i then have to wear like last year .
no problem --
and you have to meet my father .
kyle , honey , come in . i ' m so glad you came . <continued_utterance> have a seat , honey . do you want a soda or something ?
no . what do you want ?
but here ' s the rub . the guy i ' m talking about has got to be self-employed .
you mean , like an architect or something ?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions .
about <person> ?
<person> ' s just science we don ' t understand yet . <person> . <person> .
who wrote science fiction .
<person> here .
but , <person> .
any last wishes ?
let them out there read my mind .
train you for what ?
i want to get back in the cage .
it ' s always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road .
but -- what happens if i -- - cs -- glinda speaks to dorothy o . s . in f . g . --
it ' s against regulations to go up this time of year !
screw regulations ! four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there !
look who ' s up .
where am i ?
well . yeah !
how is my dog ?
that was a rangefinder . as long as you have that , they know where you are .
they ? you mean head office ?
really ? that ' s good . he loves wrestling so much .
he ' s a really sweet kid . our girls love him .
baby , what ' s wrong ?
where . is . she .
that is absolutely not true .
well what the fuck are we supposed to do ?
let me get this straight . <person> owes you money . so , as collateral , he gives you his car .
only now i ' m starting to think the car wasn ' t exactly <person> ' s to give .
oh --
. oh , did that hurt ?
what kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at ?
what kind of life is it to be hidden away ? i know you believe that what you are suggesting for franklin is best . but i think you are making it harder for him .
so i hear . you ' ve also been smoking a lot of marijuana , i understand .
do you think that ' s why i ' ve been having these . . spells ?
i said i never heard of him .
but <person> had . <person> was his extradition advisor . she knew who he was and what he knew .
<person> ' t they gon na wonder were you ' ve been ?
i was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop . they ' ll believe me . i ' ve been lying for so long , one more time won ' t hurt .
he was on the phone ? jill nods .
<person> ?
a shame . mutant creatures provide new and previously unimagined taste sensations . <continued_utterance> shall i clear all this away ?
no , it looks terrific . thank you . we ' re happy .
it ' s the desert that makes you crazy . the loneliness out here . nobody to talk to . <person> on the run . <person> parks . <person> trash . i seen some peculiar things on a hot day . i seen a scorpion sting itself to death . it just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again . a little killer killing itself . seen a coyote kill itself too . just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs . near tore one clean off before it bled to death . and what a white man ' ll do when it ' s freezing one moment , hot as hell the next . a man could get hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another kiss kissy kiss . nice pussy y ' see , see it coming . i don ' t know what it is about the desert . i figger it ' s sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire . <person> is mostly water . we boil when it ' s hot . ' cept when we boil the water ' s got no place to go . it just churns inside of us until we can cool off . if it ' s not too late . bobby is now revealed standing next to the blind man , and we
you sure seen a lot for a blind man .
you were in an accident ?
last year . i drove my car up a tree . nothing serious , this . . a minor concussion . but the car looked bad . it could have been bad . i think it scared the hell out of norman .
you a sailor man ? that ' d be the life . drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . a man could pretty well disappear like that . just sail away until all he was was a memory . i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .
i hope so . <person> , mckenna about your wife : if i had known she was married --
i don ' t know , it was weird . i saw some guy walking down the road .
where did he go ?
do what ?
turn her over to a stalker .
where did you find this ?
in the children ' s section . i wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was .
your parents are divorced ?
since i was five . my mom ' s a cocktail waitress .
you could have a great beach house for that .
sure you could , in wildwood , new jersey . if you sold this , you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth . but you wouldn ' t have much left over for decoration .
and you should shut the hell up , princess .
i will not fight him .
hey , <person> ! ! <continued_utterance> <person> been out here ?
i ' ve changed my mind . i ' d . i ' d like to come back inside . i don ' t want to stay out here any more . funny things . i hear funny things out here .
only if you don ' t know which words to say . <continued_utterance> words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of porthos ' kisses .
not likely .
of course .
. does this do anything ?
lefty , have you seen <person> , today ?
<person> , haven ' t you heard ? <person> ' s been arrested .
those aren ' t mine .
they came from your car .
i see . and what would you do if `` she '' walked in her right now ?
`` she '' ?
i dunno , <person> . i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare .
well it ' s working . what am i gon na do , <person> ? i ' m obsessed . i think about <person> so much my balls ache .
where the hell are those generators ?
coming up , sir !
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus . its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we ' ve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years . or it may not .
what alien environment ?
which is also why i ' ve withheld this information from nato and our allies .
. <person> ' t we once investigate <person> ?
cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves .
they still need us to carry out their preparations .
. her face is careworn .
yes . that ' s <person> .
maybe you resent how busy i ' ve been .
what are you . ? no .
you can ' t play around with these tent people .
i ' m not playing around . i forgot .
how do you know that the stock is going to go up ?
you really don ' t want to know any more than that , mr . <person> . <person> ' s just say i have some friends .
<person> from russell ?
nobody has .
where am i ?
you ' re in my home , <person> . you gave me quite a scare . i thought i lost you . <continued_utterance> lucky the snap didn ' t break the bone , just bruised it . i know that ' s of little comfort now , but trust me , it ' s a good thing . that dirty trap however ' s prime for spreading infection , need to finish cleaning out that wound and then i ' ll get some `` evening primrose '' in you . <person> stuff the indian <person> used it back in the day to heal , well . just about everything . so ' s do i . <continued_utterance> <person> and relax .
what do you mean ?
<person> . i ' m going to have a baby . <continued_utterance> it ' s yours . please don ' t ask me how i know . is it all right ? you can change your mind . i ' d understand .
<person> ' t matter to me . if i went down in history like <person> , i ' d die happy . all they say about him today is --
-- he kept the peace .
no , i don ' t . not a thing . i don ' t feel a thing . uh , do you want me to do you ?
what the hell was that ?
he would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?
do i need to remind you what happened to his wife ? to his daughter ? i will stake my reputation that <person> didn ' t kill those guards .
we ' re gon na go to the next town and stop . we ' ll get a motel room . i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money . we ' re gon na need money . thelma . how much money do you have with you ?
what ? oh , i don ' t know . let me look . <continued_utterance> sixty-four dollars . <continued_utterance> umm . <person> . forty-four dollars . <continued_utterance> i ' m cash poor .
it was mcelroy , <person> . <continued_utterance> last guy i would have figured . but he ' s part of it .
i hope you don ' t have any doubts about that .
god , he could be the next person to talk into the store . he could be . <person> . george pappas , in his twenties , one of <person> ' s
morning .
how did you --
<person> brought a ouija board and we summoned her .
that ' s okay . you don ' t have to .
actually , it ' s not that i don ' t want to go . it ' s just that i ' ve never been on a boat and i ' m not sure i can handle it .
to the gods , yes . that he is fallible . as the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth -- it ' s alive , this swing , a living sculpture -- and down through contact , always down , into terra firma , striking the ball crisply -- with character -- a tuning fork goes off in your heart , your balls -- such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot -- and then the follow through to finish , always on line -- the reverse ' c ' of the golden bear , the steelworker ' s power and brawn of <person> ' s arnold palmer , the da vinci of hogan , the unfinished symphony of roy mcavoy .
what ? what ' s unfinished ?
<person> . and what ' s here ?
unless i miss my bet . my wife .
for how long ?
three more weeks .
ahh . c . i . a . stories are all alike . i wanta find rafael .
you need help ?
that ' s none of your business . get the keys .
i don ' t want no dirty money . i run an honest business .
what ?
i ' ve got to be in washington d . c . in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life . and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas , chasing phantom tanker trucks .
a piece . only a piece .
is it enough ?
are you alright ?
what the hell are you doing ? you could ' ve killed me !
please .
<person> , sergeant sacker .
i love daisies .
you told me .
whatever my life is , i ' m going to be friggin ' sure i ' m never disappointed --
disappointment isn ' t something anyone plans for . it catches you by surprise . long pause . they are both sorry to have raised their voices . <continued_utterance> have i told you how proud i am of you -- ?
yeah . me , too .
what should we eat ?
this wasn ' t your first time , was it , <person> ? how many we talking ?
hitchhikers ? i don ' t know -- fifty . a hundred maybe -- who keeps track ?

is that the entire message ?
<person>it ! i ' ve never been lucky ! not one time ! <continued_utterance> shit . that little sonofabitch burgled me . i don ' t believe it . <continued_utterance> <person> ? are you okay ? <continued_utterance> <person> . it ' s okay . <person> ? i ' m sorry . i mean it .
it ' s not okay , thelma . it ' s definitely not okay . none of this is okay . what are we going to do for money ? what are we gon na buy gas with ? our good looks ? i mean . <person> , thelma !
she wants to see you -- now .
i hope you don ' t think i ' m interested in her .
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
hey , take it easy . i ' m just a dude trying to make a buck .

that ' s a relief .
i went to the hotel . <person> shot at somebody . i found a shell casing . i ' ll have it analyzed in the morning .
irs ? they ' re not gon na leave me alone !
<person> commission .
. needs constant attention . <continued_utterance> enough ice for one day . <continued_utterance> you never take this off ?
why do men always want to undress the one part of a woman ' s body she doesn ' t want to reveal ?
<person> , oh man , oh man .
well , we ' re out .
course i am , mama .
what times <person>s train get in ?
i wouldn ' t be a proper girlfriend if i didn ' t nag every now and then .

they ' re going to fry me for it , anyway .
<person> ' s going to fry anybody . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry , they have no idea where you are .
it ' s your own fault . we never should have endangered a civilian . you should have put an agent into place .
there was no time . <person> is too smart for that ; he would have spotted the agent a mile away .
<person> .
<person> .
the teeth doin ' any talkin ' ?
ray . stop calling . i told you the dental records will take time .
they , uh , they got to my witness .
. and is that serious ?
i think i will .
<person> ! that ' s why the court exists . the court doesn ' t exist to give them justice , eh ? but to give them a chance at justice .
so , what is it you do , <person> . ?
cooper . <person> cooper . oh you know , whatever pays best . little bartending , used to teach tennis , played a little competition . .
it ' s a desert . that ' s what deserts do at night ; they get cold .
<person> . <person> ! i ' m gon na stop for a second .
next week . we only have a four month school year .

<person> ' t try it !
<person> , just go to hell !
very well . i won ' t discuss it any further with you . will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are ?
what for ?
yes !
i should risk coming right over the top and snap-hooking it out of bounds left .
i guess . i ' ve got an ego same as any man .
<person> , ' cause i liked what i saw .
that ' s the cop from the club ! <continued_utterance> what are you doing ? get in the car ! <continued_utterance> i don ' t believe it ! you can ' t shoot a cop in the middle of the street !
had to do what i had to do .
yes ?
dr . <person> left the restaurant about forty minutes ago .
i haven ' t heard anyone mention <person> since button-up shoes went out .
you can certainly tell how old you are , my dear .
you a witness ?
er , yes . no , no i ' m not .
okay .
what okay ?
the challenger exploded . <person> ' s about to make an announcement . the public address system crackles . <person> takes <person> ' s hand as the room hushes .
come on .
sure honey , what ' s the hurry ?
i forgot my books at school .
oh , many things .
mr . <person>s got an appliance shop .
no -- it feels wonderful . i ' ve held that axe up for ages . oh -- -
oh , goodness ! how did you ever get like this ?
how do you know ? i don ' t wear them outside my dorm .
you sure ? you never . to class or anything ? because i could swear i-
you ' re looking particularly lovely this evening -- this is nicer than the leopard suit --
cut the horseshit , guys . so . the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow , so i figure there ' s gon na be a big ol ' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog ' s gon na tiptoe around it and walk on home . i was right . you owe me twelve thousand dollars .
i ' ve already dropped it on you twenty-three times .
<person> ' t worry about me . i can take it .
he also said `` listen to the water . ``
<person> to the water . <person> to the owl . he also said , don ' t trust the fucking <person> .
why not ?
he was your contact at the trout farm . a damn good man . his dog brought me this .
yes , sir .
take my friends where they want to go !
well , she ' s safe . no organism could penetrate those walls .
you think the girls are in trouble ?
and then you have to go out on the boat , and you sail and sail and sail until you are bored witless , and then , only then , do they say , let ' s turn around and you realize the trip is only half over , only it ' s not , because the wind has changed --
it hasn ' t changed . it ' s died .
no travel insurance . no refund on the tickets . so . here i am . on my honeymoon .
i ' m sorry , frank .
i ' m fine . it ' s your dad i ' m worried about . how is he ?
upstairs . resting . i can ' t understand why he ' d attack you like that .
i saved par , didn ' t i ?
i ' m just trying to understand your thinking . you were in the same spot on eighteen yesterday without a headwind and you --
i kinda shanked it , eh ?
no , no , no . you were great .
i said i didn ' t know you were in the corps .
i wasn ' t in the corps .
starting to burn .
that ' s good . it means the circulation ' s coming back .
put all your change in your right pocket . <continued_utterance> very good . now tie your left shoelace in a double knot . <continued_utterance> esta bueno . now , turn your hat around backwards and put a blue tee behind your right ear .
i ' ll look like a fool .
ninety-six .
congratulations .
wow . once again , <person> does not break a sweat .
i ' m afraid he might have broken something else , <person> .
<person> ' t disappear on me again .
hey , brody , lonnie . <person> this out . <continued_utterance> looks like we got ourselves a little party .
my job . back off , benedict . <continued_utterance> the only man i called `` dad '' owns a little grocery store in xenia , ohio . he learned a lot of cool stuff from my <person> , who was a peach farmer in his day . <person> knew the right thing to say in every situation , and it usually involved peaches . my dad ' s a lot like him . and he taught me , you have to focus on the peachy side of life , not the pits . <continued_utterance> there was a time when canned peaches were the hottest , greatest thing ever invented . it was like a little taste of summer , anytime you wanted . grocery stores couldn ' t keep them in stock , they were so popular . and even though other canned fruits like pears , plums , and pineapples have come along , people still need to know they can get their canned peaches , on the same shelf , whenever they want them . it ' s comforting , you know ? it fulfills their expectations . <continued_utterance> you ' re probably wondering if there ' s a point to all this and i guess it ' s just that i goofed last month . i not only moved the canned peaches , i restocked the shelves with kiwi , guava , and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup . i challenged people ' s expectations . and you can ' t do that to your customers . so , i ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches . <continued_utterance> thanks for teaching me an important lesson . what makes a family is love , not blood .
all is fair in `` heaven , '' ted-baby .
<person> .
y ' all have a nice day . drive safe .
had you ever seen a `` white squall '' before this incident ?
no .
all right , honestly ? you did sell us into slavery .
<person> whoa whoa ! hold a grudge much ? that was like a fortnight ago .
<person> , <person> betrayed us .
<person> will kill him later .
not hungry .
<person> ! please . <person> ' t walk away from me .
so , <person> . your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of rice crispie treats and chocolate <person> at the annual bake sale .
that ' s just one example . my reporting has made a difference .
pretending there isn ' t a problem won ' t fix it . he can clear the air on <person> relations .
forget it , <person> .
maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him . <continued_utterance> i ' m surprised you didn ' t write one about me .
i ' m still working on it . <continued_utterance> remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidentally started frying kids ' brains ?
<person> , i know i ' ve been out of touch .
i was a little worried . i mean --
nobody stalks me . so i drink .
well , we ' re out of drinks up here .
what ' s that ? can you repeat-
we ' re on highway <number> ! oh god , please hurry ! we need help ! my friend is hurt-
maybe it ' s my grip . maybe i ' m opening up too soon . too late . coming over the top . no , dropping underneath . oh , sweet <person> , why have you abandoned me ?
you want me to stay , boss ?
why then .
because it looks good . <continued_utterance> i ' m just not like you . ya know ? i ' m never going to go to yale . i ' m never going to be `` <person> '' .
<person> i ' m late . did i miss anything ?
i thought you were dead .
it ' s them , only an hour north .
but this is the border .
we hung out last night , remember ?
i also remember you drove your car here . who are you really ? make no mistake , i will shoot you and not feel bad about it . who are you working for ?
it wasn ' t hard .
i used to helm a school ship . a long time ago .
piggyback ride ?
<person> , come on , leave <person> alone .
<person> , supriom , luwatha . <continued_utterance> what did i do ?
not bad , <person> . i ' m impressed . you busted the lock .
you ' re insane if you think you ' ll find anything , and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive .
if you say that , then i say you don ' t know second lieutenant <person> very well , do you ?
gim me the three wood .
there ' s wind up there .
<person> well . load your guns .
what was that , admiral ?
hah . i - i must have bitten you a couple of times .
come on -- i ' ve got another idea .
uh . in the , well , in the interests of her family . you , dr . gruber , you know , you can never tell what a jury is going to do . st . <person> ' s a very well thought of institution . her doctors .
her doctors killed her .
i suppose you ' d like to teach me a lesson in manners , too .
i ' d be honored .
well . i ' m smitten with a woman .
that ' s good . is she smitten with you ?
yes .
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you ? !
hell of a night , huh ?
i was only going to the mall for some christmas wrapping paper .
wrap her up in blankets . bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put her in the car . <person> .
you don ' t think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
you ' re not from ohio .
i know . <continued_utterance> but if she fucks tip our friendship - she can go to hell . i won ' t allow it ! we are bros .
please don ' t make us sing again !
if i have to listen to <person> ' s singing voice one more time , i ' ll fall on my own sword !
<person> , guys . what the hell ' s khruschev thinking ?
did you have any indication of this from georgi ? any possible warning or sense of motivation ?
i don ' t believe you ' d turn . treacherous yes , traitorous no .
i ' ll bring them to you .
you ' re welcome . <continued_utterance> james i <continued_utterance> i ' m okay . i just lost my balance .
i put you on the floor .
i ' ll get my things .
traveling light , huh ? okay , here we go . <continued_utterance> to the west !
and when he arrived at your house , was anyone there ?
no .
the most honest moment in a man ' s life is the five minutes after he ' s blown a load . that ' s a medical fact . and it ' s because you ' re no longer trying to get laid . you ' re actually thinking like a girl . they love that .
<person> you ' re right .
eyes darting wildly , looking up .
plunging straight for him .
i ' m going this morning .
but <person> said .
it ' s just such a mess . with <person> i mean .
nothing i understand better than a mess . grace <person> was with my mom after my real <person> died . <continued_utterance> you mean the shaman ?
that ' s what you think i ' m doing ?
yes .
you ' re one sick bastard . a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission . i think no matter which way i go i ' m likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic . so here ' s my answer : kiss my ass , hop-along . <continued_utterance> not bad for a gimp .
what ' s with that `` x '' on the back of your head ? does that mean you ' re `` extreme '' ? i ' ve got some news for you , mr . x , you ' re a three time loser . so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x ' s on your head .
certainly . <continued_utterance> you can understand how a man could go off like that . i mean , a big , faceless organization like yours , coming in with their jack-booted thugs and stealing private property . <continued_utterance> . is how he described it .
that doesn ' t explain how he managed to tear through our security .
your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations
no -
that was really something . that dancing girl . what did it mean ?
<person> . if you work with <person> you learn that right away .
my business is in trouble . my mother would have something wise to say .
i ' m a brilliant businessman . it ' s what i do best . what ' s your business ?
it ' s the best present i ever got . i just love it . i ' m going to pretend i ' m shooting .
<person> ' t point that thing at anybody or i won ' t teach you to shoot .
oh !
what are you doing ? sleep-walking ?
<person> , right .
<person> . just keep telling yourselves that , the only people who can fuck this up is us .
woody ? ! what are you doing ?
hold still , <person> ! <continued_utterance> ha-ha ! !
how did he get it ?
some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water . but that theory is speculative at best .
why what ?
why did you forget the tent check ?
buddhist , i believe , though we have not seen him in some time . i myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage .
likewise .
just tell ' em what we know and be done with it . that ' s what he ' d want .
<person> for you to say .
he ' s developing a hemisphere imbalance .
<person> so i can understand .
<person> , she ' s hanging in there .
well , you always did take good care of her . <person> . man of priorities . <continued_utterance> got a little something for ya . <person> always said never go anywhere empty handed .
that ' s <person> ' s colt !
you were supposed to buy a plow horse .
oh , hey - it was nothing .
<person> ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight ?
twenty-four hundred dollars that you charged for labor , is the same as if mr . <person> had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done .
maybe i ' m missing the point here , but if he paid twenty-four hundred , which is the cost of the job , i can ' t see anything wrong with that . i don ' t know the guy , but i don ' t quite get the problem .
this guy on amsterdam who repairs zippers . you ' ll never have to buy new luggage .
stop teasing .
you can ' t do that yourself ?
hell no , i can ' t do that myself . i ' m blind . <person> ' t you see that ?
you ' re having it .
i don ' t want to !
more or less .
not this twig , friend . i got plans .
thursday .
the interview with <person> .
i don ' t see how . when i ' m finished i return it right away .
when was the last time you used it ?
yes , sir !
bring this man a change of good clothes . has he eaten ?
you are very , very tall .
no he ' s not , dad . he just appears tall because you are on the floor .
<person> , we ' ll make everyone watch us eat a squirrel . <person> you get real ? there ' s no going back ! there ' s , nothing to go back to ! it ' s just ashes .
<person> , like it ' s so hard to build a new hut . it ' s just a pile of sticks and dung --
i know .
so then tell her you changed your mind . no one can question that .
no . unless you ' re talking about the bus problem .
. <person> problem ?
come on , i ' m good at this .
you are not carrying me inside .
then give me the money i earn !
<person> , no . i ' m putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it -- cuss me now , thank me later .
i ' m not your mother now . i ' m speaking for your father . and this is what he would have told you . never forget the code of the d ' artagnans . it is your special heritage . always seek out adventure .
i will .
when we fall , we fall hard .
amazing .
no , if i fall in front of thousands of people i lose everything but their pity . they ' ll be writing my obituary before i get up off the floor .
<person> won ' t let you fall , he ' ll be there . all the arrangements have been made , boss . it ' ll be fine .
what ?
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone ?
how is that ?
through , through his book .
eight murders in less than a year . all of them indian . all of them unsolved . is the law a non-entity out here or what ?
those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant . they were executed at close range . that one there is a police officer killed by the mohawks up in canada more recently .
you were right , <person> . they got me good . <person> ' t let ' em get you too .
<person> somebody get the damn dog out-
<person> what i want -- and i never asked you for anything -- is to be your co-pilot on this . i want to take this airline , turn it around , and make it work . it ' s gon na make us a fortune !
i ' m talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline . it ' s gon na take me two years and <number> headaches to turn <person> around , what do i need this dink airline for ? i ' m up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake .
i would hardly say you look like trash .
no thanks to you .
they will suffice .
you ' re welcome . now tell me . <continued_utterance> what were you doing , in that ?
anything else i can get you ?
some cigars . case of beer .
you ' re going to burn up in those .
the white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler . that ' s why they wear them .
i ' m very worried about my body .
your what ?
so what about me ? what should i buy ?
<person> ' t they even tell you the pediatrician ' s name ?
no . not yet . oh and he was smoking too . he ' s sixteen !
he ' s probably on drugs .
' important business . ' <continued_utterance> i understand . men make bold plans in secret . and women wait . to mourn , or to celebrate the outcome . i know from experience , it ' s a lonely vigil .
all i can tell you is . i ' m on a mission for the king .
<person> --
we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . i don ' t even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you ' re coming back . or if you ' re coming back .
take a good look .
you ?
jimmy , i said , don ' t you go in your pocket if there ' s nothing there .
. and what did he say . ?
there ' ll be another train . the man who was killed tonight was a policeman , <person> . it ' s my job to find out who did it . i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there .
i saw him .
this is where i stand up for all the little guys everywhere who ' ve had their fill of soulless robots like <person> --
he may be a soulless robot but he ' s a rich , happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who ' s got you by the huevos -- besides , how is getting into the u . s . open gon na change what she thinks about you ?
our daughter , our only daughter , has fallen for a brilliant manipulator twice her age .
<person> , for god ' s sake talk sense .
but . . . ?
nothing , it ' s just that , , well , it ' s been awhile since arsonist ' s <person> , and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were .
you ' re gon na need it , rookie , trust me . <continued_utterance> an all-terrain mobile video monitoring system for surveillance . i call it the `` roach cam '' . see the little camera it ' s got for a head ?
kinda looks like you .
like i said , i hadn ' t really expected to use it . <person> , i ' m going through a drawer . i hear a car . i look out the window . i see <person> driving away . i leave my room , and there ' s <person> .
in cutoffs , a wet t-shirt .
what do you mean ?
the huguenot rebellion , occupation in the antilles and <person> . the coming war with france . these are not the usual hobbies of youth .
not like this . we were never like this . i want to go over there . after dinner , we can --
why ?
you told her she was a `` fuck buddy . ``
never .
<person> . show me an honest man .
stands about so . <person> hair . <person> kind of banged up . was in an accident .
we agree .
so . maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations .
a guy breaks into my house and i ' m being charged with assault ? it makes no sense .
<person> ' s get it down right . the guy broke into your house , you hit him in the head with a gun , went to the refrigerator , took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him .
feed her , i guess .
<person> , but what ?
what a relief . now i can go home .
no , <person> . your journey has just begun . it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of <person> , whose evil powers have darkened our world . upon you depends this princess ' s life .
the car ' s still in town , daddy .
what ?
change my mind ? ? ? oh <person> , please . please be happy .
i will . i promise . as soon as i stop being terrified . <continued_utterance> i ' m so tired .
still there . how ' s yours ?
i guess you took my mind off it .
oh .
i was in an accident once too . a horse almost trampled me to death .
<person> call . so we just need a new strategy , that ' s all . what about that judge that ' s always throwing work your way ? can ' t she help you out ?
judge <person> , yeah . if it wasn ' t for her i ' d probably be out of business already . i just need more .
-- so i always just run out at <number> : <number> to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter ' s house . <person> , <person> never minded about it and i was just hoping it would be ok with you too .
well -- <person> -- i realize that scottsville is not exactly a major banking center .
only from time to time , which is unusual .
what is it ?
it wasn ' t an easy choice .
i think i made the wrong one .
why do i have to lie in the road ?
somebody has to .
maybe we are crazy for doing this . but if we do it , we do it right . i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldn ' t have to do it again .
not much chance of that . <person> ' s an idiot .
who ' s that ?
the wives .
this thing ' s shrunk .
pants always shrink in closets .
<person> , sure . with only an infinitesimal chance of permanent spinal paralysis . i ' ve read all about it .
it ' s your chosen profession , geek . <continued_utterance> there ' s an intimacy involved in playing existenz that is beyond description . it has to be experienced . and frankly , the two-player version is the most exquisitely intense . <person> ' t you like to play with me ?
you killed one of the cardinal ' s guards . an offense punishable by death .
he interrupted a duel i was fighting .
we were sold to the palace . but i won ' t serve these people ! i ' d rather die !
keep that up and you will .
you ' re angry .
i don ' t get angry .
-- this play means a lot to me .
this play -- ?
this is crazy , where could he be ?
i don ' t know , he ' s upset , maybe he went for a walk .
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood . i have them soaking . you can wear these .
your husband ' s ?
meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger .
how `` big '' are we talking about ?
working out .
is he gon na do it every morning ?
<person> ' t start , alright .
<person> . why so pissed ?
my real parents would probably have given me an elegant name , too . i say ' real parents ' because i suspect i ' m a foundling . somebody royal -- or at least very , very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother . tell me more about you .
every day of my life feels like a mile on the bataan death march .
he ' s a softy . got him wrapped around my finger .
you think so .
oh . now . it ' s probably not such a good idea right now . i ' ll . catch up with you later , on down the road .
you keep this !
well , i ' m supposed monitor these seismographs . you know , they measure vibrations .
<person> , vibrations in the ground .
not you . your talent .
you ' re lying .
why ?
i don ' t know . my friends are here . i like the scenery . i don ' t know .
wow . i thought i was the only one .
so .
i think i made the wrong one .
you didn ' t take any pictures when it was over .
why so melancholy ?
you were born naked , wet , and hungry . now you ' re hip , handsome , and rich . you are the coxswain on the ship of life .
are you expecting someone ?
who would i be expecting here ?
<person> ?
up .
thats your business . i dont care how .
like an accident where maybe <person> might also get hurt ?
whoa . take it easy .
where is she ?
yes ! <continued_utterance> damn ! della !
shoot , kenneth ! that ' s <person> ' s favorite doll .
personally , i hate her guts . well , pardon me , <person> . i feel like throwing up some more now .
you didn ' t happen to see <person> did you ?
do you know why you have been brought here ?
n-no .
three million ?
maybe more .
oh , <person> , <person> . quoting yourself , ' it is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls . '
well , <person> damn . a lost and desperate soul stands before you . i assume i have the confidentiality of doctor-client privilege in regards to this outfit ?
i . i don ' t know what ' s real .
what happened that night , <person> ?
<person> the car ! <continued_utterance> you watch your mouth , buddy . <continued_utterance> <person> back to the interstate .
<person> ! i . i , which way ?
`` whoever you were '' ? ? ?
listen . i ' ve for to tell you something . i beg you to believe me . help me -- all <person> ' s suspicions come rushing back . <continued_utterance> something happened to my mind . <person> suppression , false implant , i don ' t know what -- <person> backs off . <person> grows more desperate . <continued_utterance> what i ' m saying is . i don ' t remember you . i don ' t remember us . i don ' t remember me -- <person> ' s expression grows dead hard .
while you wait and be patient , the nine realms laugh at us ! the old ways are done . you ' d stand giving speeches while <person> falls !
you ' re a vain , greedy , cruel boy !
nine thousand dollars .
what is he planning on telling them ?
i think i ' m gon na be sitting up with her .
i ' d do the same . well , catch you thursday .
<person> .
<person> hold me .
geez , <person> , it ' s three-thirty in the morning . where are we going to sleep ?
we ' re not . you and i are going to get some food .
that took long enough . you forget my mounds ?
i really do think the country done changed just a little while i was away , peanut .
remember our friend <person> ? well , i didn ' t know where to mail his last paycheck so i sent my assistant by his mother ' s apartment . turns out there is no diabetic mom . <person> said she ' s been dead for ten years .
and this adversely affects me how . ?
i told you what i ' m seein ' <person> about . that ' s all .
<person> , business . <person> to be rid of you . you ' re not in the girly mood .
what brings you here ?
i ' d like to tell you . but i can ' t .
he jumped fritz .
i ' m sure he did . and where is your young partner this day ?

<person> got what counts .
<person> to me <person> ' s part of it . maybe at the top of it . <continued_utterance> yeah . i can put it all together when i get back , ' til then , you know nothing , understand ? business as usual .
i hear you .
oh , hi .
can you come over ?
orthopedics ?
i ' m just an m . d .
<person> , you got a man . you just have to take control . .
<person> only has two moods : busy . and asleep .
reckon he hated perfection more than us ? you suppose he <continued_utterance> maybe he just couldn ' t pull the trigger .
oh sure , he figured it was easier to die of thirst ? come on , sombody must ' ve chased him up there .
did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in ? . did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone ?
i really did miss your mind while i was out at pee dee , honey . the rest of you , too , of course . but the way your head works is gods own private mystery . what was it you was thinkin ?
hello . i ' m the captain of this plane . may i ask your name ?
sure , my name is <person> . why ?
journalist ? you knew the man who was killed ? fifty thousand nicaraguans have died . and now one yankee . <person> now americans will be outraged at what is happening here , eh ?

<person> , force the sub to the surface for inspection .
mr . president ! we ' re receiving reports that the ships are stopping !
i understand that .
what are you going to use ?
how ?
<person> . the ex-evidence teacher . his `excellent ratings ' didn ' t stop him from stealing the magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation .

gee , i don ' t know , <person> . <person> . you ' re good at that .
a chosen doesn ' t need to be strong . i ' m big this way .

dr . <person> , it takes a remarkable amount of confidence in your methods to bring on a patient with you . what in particular about <person> ' s prior condition would you like to share with us ?
nothing .
in the strait of malacca , when a boat is even five minutes late , one begins to worry , mr . <person> .
i know . pirates from sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships .
actually , i ' ve never known you to do either . but -
- we all want what we can ' t have ?
. i just , you know , after all that religious conversation , i just realized it ' s probably not so good for him to be spending so much time with someone like me who doesn ' t believe his life is important in the scheme of things --
would you please .
nice place .
thank you .
no ? i guess we ' re not counting lying , stealing and murder .
you ' ve got the wrong idea about me . i ' a a pawn in this just like poor <person> . <person> you help me find him ? i ' ll pay you anything .

where the hell are you ?
in here !
he kept saying he was protected .
what does that mean ?
who ? your husband ?
and i ' m afraid . oh god , i ' m so afraid of .
that grandmother of yours -- she ' s really something .
<person> ? she ' s not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine . her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn ' t like to be alone .

yeah . here , i ' ll give you an example . <continued_utterance> <person> never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it . and with <person> , as i said , the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety . when he was really flipping out , in other words .
<person> was catholic ?
yes .
<person> . i was afraid of that . she left this garbled message on my machine . can you calm her down ?
then let ' s not get caught .

then you ' re saying the book ' s wrong ?

nice to run into you again .
whose side are you arguing . ? i thought that you wanted to do something . i don ' t have any interest in the woman ' s ' estate ' -- no offense , but we all know where the money ' s going to . i have an interest in the hospital ; and i don ' t want those bozos working in the same shop as me . they gave her the wrong anesthetic . they turned the girl into a vegetable . they killed her and they killed her kid . you caught ' em . now : how many others did they kill ? a beat . gruber discards end of a cigar . takes a leather case from his suede jacket , extracts a new cigar . offers one to galvin . <continued_utterance> you want a cigar ?
the hospital is owned by the archdioceses of .
what ? you don ' t love me ? <continued_utterance> me either .
you don ' t love me ? <continued_utterance> but we ' re so right for each other .
there was .
there was a time when i would have welcomed it .
this guy ' s looking to play tit for tat . that ' s not my game . i ' m gon na play hardball .
what ' s going on ?
yeah . and the first mexican .
yes ?
i just have to go to <person> ' s house .
why ?
i agree . <continued_utterance> so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters ?
that ' s right . they want something . dramatic . i spoke to a number of people who said you ' re the one to see .
they ' re merely tools to disseminate information .
or disinformation . if you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? maybe one degree a minute ?
i ' m so terribly sorry . am i too late ?
ah , mr . <person> . you ' re just in time to congratulate your nephew . he inherited the empire .
we need something : a flare , a signal mirror .
no .
me ? no , i ' m not a bigot .
if you ' re not , how come you ' re making such a big thing out of it ?
c ' mon , <person> , a lotta times they don ' t find a body . you know what the currents are like in that water .
you had to see his face when that wave hit . he wasn ' t scared <person> . it was like he was expecting it , waiting for it . he knew it was coming .
it ' s a marble floor , we can clean it up .
oh god . this is insane .
i ' m so sorry .
<person> ' t know he was dead , every stinking paper on the globe .
-- i wear the sweater because i ' m cold . i read because no one talks to me . my hair is my hair . what is it exactly that ' s bothering you ?
you don ' t care what people say ?
you ' re joking .
weapons . misdemeanor one .
then who was it ?
it was <person> .
i don ' t like it here . i don ' t know what ' s going on . we ' re blundering around together in this unformed world , whose rules and objectives are largely unknown , seemingly indecipherable , or even possibly non-existent , always on the verge of being killed by forces we don ' t understand .
that sounds like my game , all right .
about what you said this morning . <continued_utterance> you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife . fifty-thousand dollars .
i do .
and this is why you never told the d . a .
you tell me , <person> . if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?
something like that . do you live around here now ?
<person> and i just bought this divine house in pleasant valley . do you know it ? great for the kids . <continued_utterance> it ' s the first time i ' ve left the doors unlocked since i was a child growing up in the midwest . <person> ' s been promoted to vp of united motors so it ' s all happening for us . but enough of me . how are you ?
i want <person> to have an advantage that you and i never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
what is a sip of coffee going to do ?
thank you , <person> .
that ' s not the way to <person> ' s trailer . i told you .
all a . <number> bullet would do is make a hole in his head .
one bullet , maybe .
i guess . <person> never tells <person> the truth about how much he pays for these things .
you ' re really good friends with the chancellor , aren ' t you ?
he ' s a riot .
oh , yeah ? well , you ' re not handcuffed to him . anybody in the back room ?
we can change our names .
we can live in a hacienda .
a fugitive <person> for a murder suspect . <person> somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine .
try the fort laramie treaty . all over again .
this . this whole god damn thing . making yourselves into some sort of
the point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility . to recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings .
because i guarantee she ' s married and has a couple kids . girls like <person> don ' t stay single .
what if you ' re wrong ? you just said she ' s the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ?
i don ' t understand .
maybe you ' re not supposed to . <continued_utterance> i might kiss you .
i guess i ' ve got wander in my blood .
where you headed ?
there you are , ted-baby . everything all right ?
yeah . everything ' s cool .
that ' s our friend <person> .
not our <person> ?
they ? you mean head office ?

am i cursed ?
gin and ginger ale . elephants love booze . one whiff of this and she ' s not thinking about cabbages no more . . moj malutki paczuszek ?
greg , right ? are you polish ?
of course not . but whatever it was revived , it . well , the thing was probably disoriented . and realized it couldn ' t survive for long in our atmosphere . but being the incredibly adaptable creature it was . it tried to become something that could . before the norwegians killed it . it somehow got to this dog .
what do you mean `` got '' to the dog ?
that too .
did he say if he wants to see me ?
i ain ' t speaking ill o ' the dead .
you already did .
why are you here ?
to collect . i have the things you need to destroy <person> ' s play . these same things can be used to destroy you .
not if you ' re with him every step of the way .
the man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people ' s lives . he lost control and is capable of doing it again .
what do you make of them ?
<person> ' ites , i think .
<person> . i see . how much do you want ? <continued_utterance> you want more than this ? <continued_utterance> you want something else ?
drop the package . put your hands behind your head . you ' re under arrest .
i ' ve had time to get over it .
you ' re not from around here , are you ?
it has nothing to do with him .
well , what does it have to do with ?
he won ' t go into the interrogation room .
someplace else , then .
nobody saw her leave ? yes . i understand . <continued_utterance> i have to go . i have to go home .
should we bring the police into this ?
not very original . <person> ' s day .
i didn ' t even think about it .
then why the clean overalls ?
it ' s a mental thing . helps me focus . the one thing you don ' t want to do is miss with the stud- finder .
yes , but there ' s just something about him . something around the eyes , i don ' t know , reminds me of . me . no . i ' m sure of it , i hate him .
he ' s drunk .
<person> , heavy duty . <person> . <person> . it ' s one of those few places we ' d never go to as kids . still don ' t . some of the old people say <person> is buried back there . we have to go <person> . together . like his vision .
<person> . when i fill out my <number> , do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation ?
you ruined my life , <person> . me and my wife . and i am going to ruin yours . you don ' t have to go out there to see that girl . we been going four years . four years . my wife ' s been crying herself to sleep what they , what , what they did to her sister .
i swear to you i wouldn ' t have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case .

and he has no qualms about .
<person> rid of him ?
yes . <person> rid of him .
<person> ' t you wan na tell me you love me ?

a menorah .
it doesn ' t look like a menorah .
how can i be together if i ' m not together ?
you ' re on somethin ' again , aren ' t you ?
<person> enough . but it ' s not that simple , <person> . when i was down and had nothing , it was <person> who helped me . he got me all my clients -- you among them . and he can take it away like that . you may find out one day -- that when you ' ve had money and lost it , it ' s worse than never having had it at all .
that ' s bullshit ! <person> out that door , i ' m changing the locks .
is that just beer ?
primarily . although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia . you missed a few bottles , by the way .
i propose we get your father a job here in ukiah and you can come and live with him .
brilliant . not that i ' m fond of ukiah , but i ' d live in a drainage culvert to be with you .
before we knew it , we created the most popular men ' s magazine in the entire nation . the rest is history .

mr . president , i believe my team is in agreement . if we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a soviet satellite nation in our hemisphere , the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate . the russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want , wherever they want , and we ' re powerless to stop them . if they succeed .
it will be <person> all over again .

you have killed our women and children , bombed our cities from afar like cowards , and dare to call us terrorists -- <continued_utterance> -- but now the oppressed have been given a mighty sword , to strike back at their enemies . unless the us pulls all military forces out of the persian gulf area , immediately and forever , <person> will rain fire on one major us city each week until these demands are met . <continued_utterance> . first one weapon will be detonated on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of <person> ' s power and our willingness to be humanitarian . however , if there demands are not -- in a burst of static the image goes black .

what did you find ?
something i couldn ' t show to anyone else . not without more information . and not without causing the kind of attention i ' d just as soon avoid right now . the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i ' ve never seen before . what it did to them it did extremely fast . and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain , it survives very nicely outside the body .
. more of a half-wit . for a start a war could break out there any day .
that ' s just media talk . they ' re . . just a minority . they ' re powerless .
well . look at that one , eh ?

then somebody ' d better deny it publicly .
how did you two get separated ? you were so close on the dance floor .
i told you , sweetheart . we got pushed apart by the crowd . this older married couple brought me to the ferry .
iandiacute ; m in the process of running more tests . but it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker .
can you help him ?
i never get used to seeing him like this . the most powerful being in the nine realms lying helpless until his body is restored .
but he ' s put it off for so long now , i fear . <continued_utterance> you ' re a good son . <continued_utterance> we mustn ' t lose hope that your father will return to us . and your brother .

you think the bifrost is the only way in and out of the realm ? there are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind . but i have need of them no longer , now that i am king . <continued_utterance> and i say , for your act of treason , you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper . and you are no longer a citizen of <person> .
i ' m sitting on a two shot lead with three to go , and my partner ' s in his pocket . suddenly , par ' s a good number . gim me the seven iron .

it ' s a report on weapons security in the former soviet union , which , as you know , is shaky at best . he ' s had several instances of sabotage at the pipeline , and he ' s understandably concerned . he called me the moment he realized its sensitive nature .
<person> was watching over me in geneva . a guardian angel with a laser sight . <continued_utterance> king .
i am fighting it , but it isn ' t doing me any good . <continued_utterance> <person> , this looks awfully familiar . you sure this is ok ?
it should be ok . <continued_utterance> do you have that bridge in real life ?

<person> . <continued_utterance> nothing ' s going to happen to you .
oh , i ' m more modern in my ways . i don ' t believe in sin , though there is good and evil . and evil is a thing you work at . <continued_utterance> not you mustn ' t touch . your mama might not like you handling knives .
i think he wants to see your rabbit foot .
y ' know . a man goes through what i ' ve gone through , he ' s supposed to learn something . i ' m trying to figure out what i learned . did i learn anything ?
you ' re learning some discipline and self-control .
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn ' t breathe ? that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave ?
um . sure .
so that makes you a hog . i just wanted to establish that fact , and now i have . <continued_utterance> hey . mr . <person> and i ' ve just been establishing some facts , and what we come up with is this : one , he ' s a pig who gobbles down everybody ' s candy ; two , he lies about it ; three , he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading , reading ; and four , he ' s not getting any ten-dollar gym shoes . that ' s about what we ' ve come up with so far .
oh , dad .
get back , you people ! keep moving , <person> .
you ' re going to have to do it right here , <person> .
i ' m all finished . now what ?
burn it to a fine ash .

wait a minute ! are you out of your mind ? you can ' t pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow your wife ! it ' s gross misappropriation of sector ' s resources , it ' s . it ' s a breach of national security . <continued_utterance> you copy , <person> ? this is too far . you ' re losing it big-time .
<person> going to do ? tell ?
you ' ve been so quiet lately , <person> , i thought you no longer cared .
why don ' t we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline .
how bad did mac get you ? we figured pretty bad .
i ' m fine . i ' m going to live a long time . that ' s what i called to tell you .
rest of us ' re <number> months out of independence but we ' re from <person> , <person> originally .
<person> , really ? i ' m from monmouth .
yeah . i ' m good . why ?
just checking .
four-thirty-seven .
nice .
i never said .
. and i don ' t think i ' m some lonely , middle-aged woman cracking up .
i ' d rather not , if you don ' t mind . i ' m not really a slave . i ' m a guard .
then maybe you ' d rather i speak to your commander and have you whipped to within an inch of your life . or perhaps i whip you myself ? how would you like that ?
you mean there ' s something you haven ' t asked me ?
you ' ve already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . you stopped <person> <number> . <number> and you ' ve got his module . you ' re free to go right now . why are you going to do this ?
i suggested we go to the police , but you didn ' t like that ; so , frankly , <person> , i ' m all out of ideas .
well , what ' s the big rush , thelma ? if we just give ' em some time , they ' ll come to us . ! oh christ . i ' m just not ready to go to jail yet . why don ' t you go out to the pool or something and i ' ll figure it out .
well , <person> , you still think i ' m a patsy , a simp , a chump ?
no , kid , you ' re a real hero .
i killed <person> , didn't i ?
that was a accident . i bet both our asses <person> peru done murdered all kinds of people , and meant it , too .

you don ' t think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
we check out the area and wait for a time when it ' s clear .
i said it had poppies on the wall paper ! eh -- she ' s -- what ' s this ? why , she ' s -- she ' s putting her hand on her heart -- she ' s -- she ' s dropping down on the . <continued_utterance> . bed .
oh , no -- no !
i know that .
since when ?
i ' d like to bring you up to washington , walk you around our side of things , and share some of the information we ' ve been able to develop on your cartels .
that would be very helpful to me . also , i received the offer from dea and the fbi to train some of my men at quantico . i think this will be extremely useful , a good way for us to absorb some of your methods . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been too busy to completely settle in .
i don ' t know , he ' s upset , maybe he went for a walk .
well we should take a drive , your mom can stay with the kids .
why don ' t you come to town this weekend ? we could play some golf , chase some skirts .
i ' d love to , but i really need to crack the books . final exams are coming up and i ' ve been slacking .
of course . if you can ' t beat the government , you might as well own it .
<person> - i want you to meet a friend of mine . <person> ! <person> ! come here . <continued_utterance> <person> harmsway , i want to introduce you to an old friend -
they ' re called the `` twin cities . ``

and you don ' t want to show me your face .
no .

you embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country . do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?

we got to get out of here . <person> says anything . this really scares <person> . <continued_utterance> we have to go back .
we ' re not going anywhere . not ' til we get what we came for .

today , of all days , the sun decides to shine .
watching your vr people <person> gave me the idea .
it ' s nanotechnology , isn ' t it ?

your old friend <person> appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime <person> took off with someone else .
how did you know ?
you were an innocent child .
you took me for a purpose , what was it ? <continued_utterance> tell me !
i need an introduction to the obregon brothers .

the white dot ; light in the dark . <continued_utterance> maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore .
it ' s giving .
that you made mine .
i ' m sorry .
okay . i ' ll do it .
you are incredibly brave . i have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling . i ' ve lived like this for years , so i ' m used to it . every day when i get up , i think it might be my last . but it makes you appreciate life . and the moment . because that may be all you have . <continued_utterance> to pull this cover story off , we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other . the enemy can spot a fake easily . <continued_utterance> you see what i mean ? that reaction would give us away in a second . <person> to relax .
i almost didn ' t recognize you without . you know . that stallion between . your . uh . legs . <continued_utterance> that sounded so much better in my head .
hey , ted . wan na go shopping ?
<person> .
<person> . it ' s letting up .

<person> ' t sweet lip me .
i don ' t understand where this personal attack is coming from .

i foun ' the towel .
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own . instead of trying to be a father to hers . except she thinks you ' re afraid of the responsibility .
oh ? anything else ?
use the fucking bomb !
so , we get back on that rock and in three days we ' re dead anyway . <continued_utterance> no wait ! this way !
where ' s that ?
<person> .

are you retarded , or just brain dead from whiffin ' fumes out there in the swamp .
`cuz <person> been whippin ' <person> ' s ass from the time he could talk .
what about the wife ? beat her too ?
i can see that . why ?
you run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert , you break <number> bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs , all with no health insurance . it ' s insane , i can ' t take it anymore .
you ' re going to let them get away with this . this shit ? on the word of one little white trash bitch .
you like seeing your name in the papers ? sandra glares at him . <continued_utterance> leave town , <person> . go to your place in st . barts . let things cool down . <continued_utterance> they ' ll try for twenty million . the cheaper the lawyer , the higher the demand .
where ' s <person> ?
he ' s leaving the country . and i don ' t give a shit .
i think i ' ve been . i vaguely recall .
<person> , you ' ve got to forget .
what ' s that mean ?
it means that they want you in the back room . they need more insect boards for the pod assembly bays .
you and <person> hit it off so well .
<person> , it is your business , but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy .
are you kidding ? <person> had to go out of town .
i ' m shocked .
no , no , <person> , please , really , don ' t go , don ' t bother , i ' ll go explain it to her myself .
it ' s no bother , <person> . i ' ll be glad to do it .
we just about got killed . you know what happened ? we just about got killed , and you want to go on ?

well , you ' re half right . best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me .
about what ?
go down to the seat place and straighten this out .
honey i don ' t have the time .
he kept saying , `` let it happen , let it happen . `` then he just stopped .
you mean he withdrew .
we ' re lost , you understand that ? we ' ve got no navicom , and no means to find a way back . so right now i don ' t give a damn about the gold because if we don ' t get off this desert , and out of iraqi all it ' s going to be good for is buying us tombstones .
i can ' t do it , <person> . not when we ' re so close . i can ' t let you ruin everything .
what ' s this `peeper ' riff she ' s on ?
she saw someone in the bushes earlier . she ' s reported that kind of thing a dozen other times . she ' s also reported flying saucers , so .
i ' m a terrible shot , <person> , don ' t believe i ' ll ever hit the target . he hands back the cutters .
thanks . <continued_utterance> cheerio , mate . <continued_utterance> you ' ll take good care of him , yes ?

i don ' t know , maybe we missed her .
i can ' t believe you used to bring my daughter here , to this place .

<person> , ' cause i liked what i saw .
nice place .
<person> put big daddy ' s farm in rhonda ' s and sunny ' s name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it .

we met today at the library , if you can believe that --
i ' m sorry about my coat . it ' s too big for your closet .
dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and <person> . out back we ' d light ' em up . the three of us . we ' d hold ' em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light . sparks . and dad would be all . `` get ready '' . `` watch for it '' . `` here it comes , '' here comes the `` wahoo ''

<person> ' t you dare go in . <person> . i just got her off to sleep .
it was dad . i swear .
<person> or air strike .
there is a third option . with either course we undertake the risk of nuclear war . it seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward . <continued_utterance> so i guess i ' ll be . our third choice is to cut a deal . we trade <person> and our missiles in turkey , get them to pull their missiles out . we employ a back channel , attribute the idea to u thant . u thant then raises it at the u . n .
you ' ll lose him anyway . i ' m sorry .
then you have to put him down .
that ' s all -- the crystal ' s gone dark .
oh , you . <continued_utterance> . you don ' t suppose she could really be sick , do you ? oh -- oh , i ' ve got to go home right away !

<person> came to me . he told me he ' d fire <person> if i didn ' t do it . i went along with him for <person> ' s sake . it was only pattycake , after all .

<person> , <person> is really upset . <continued_utterance> <person> .
<person> , i ' m a failure .

<person> was whoring her ?
<person> was an evil muthafucker . <continued_utterance> . born with ruthless bones . and if he really is dead and gone , this game `bout to explode .
that ' s how come .
ladies and gentlemen , the st crispin ' s day speech from <person> . to set the scene , england is now at war with france . everything rests upon the battle about to begin . <person> , the young king of england , addresses his men thusly : `` my cousin westmorland ? no , my fair cousin- '' <continued_utterance> `` if we are marked to die , we are enow/ to do our country loss ; and if to live . / the fewer me , the greater the share of honour . ``

you could have poured coffee in starbucks , you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings , you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet . you could have been one of ten thousand things . but in the end , you chose to protect people . you made that decision . and i find that very , very interesting . now all i need is your credit card number . <continued_utterance> that last part was a joke .
it ' s the heat .
they ' re here for me .
<person> ' t also true that his vessel went down off of nantucket ? lost everyone on board . in fair weather no less .

was it the heat of the sales pitch on february <number> rd of this year that made you write across a contract ' this job is free ' ?
as i remember , no sale was made concerning those customers .
it didn ' t sound like that the other day . it sounded like you hated the guy .
you have no idea what my father used to be like . no idea ! he wasn ' t like he is now ! he treated me like shit and he was all i had !
was there anything in those offices that didn ' t go to d . c . ?
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . we thought there ' d been another fatality , but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
yes , baby ?
do you think you could ever shoot someone ?
you said , `` <person> '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?
yes . <person> right now or right when i thought of it . the name and memory of <person> is haunting me . lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again . because it is only a feeling , i am powerless to stop it . and another thing , <person> , when the next murder happens you will help me solve it .
can i bring some toys ?
you can bring one toy .
i don ' t buy it .
you don ' t buy what ?

well , maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids . i ' m sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children .
<person> , i could too . but . i don ' t know why i ' m even asking you this . it ' s just . we can ' t place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie . i don ' t know . i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable . if just one person would say .
what we ' re doing is kicking ass . for <person> ' s sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews . the war is over . we ' ve just got to keep shooting people ' cause the army spent all this money , and we ' ve got to put on a show for the taxpayers .
you ' re not saying what i think you ' re saying . i can ' t believe you ' re even thinking it .
will you be having supper in this evening , sir ? time traveller i don ' t think so , mrs . <person> . why don ' t you take the evening off and celebrate . <continued_utterance> thank you , sir , but if you won ' t be needing me i think i ' ll turn in early and get some sleep . . it i can . - <person> , sir .

how long have you been having them ?
<person> ' t be such a pansy . all of this is yours .
it ' s a lot to digest . <person> how you ' d feel .
about the conspiracy ?
i think of it as an agreement . a word your father liked to use .
a bioport , now , that ' s a sort of a hole in your spine , isn ' t it ? lotta assholes `round here , but that ' s generally it . i don ' t know why you ' d be talking to me about that , lady .
sure you do .
we ' ve got bigger problems right now .
we have to try the blockades . it probably won ' t work . it may just be delaying the inevitable . but we can ' t just go to war without trying not to .
i don ' t mean about <person> being sick . i mean about <person> and me .
be with her when she wants . <person> sure she never feels alone .
my mama . so <person> , our histories have been somewhat intertwined .

-think of it as <number> days of push-ups- are you sure about this sid ? seems shaky . was this mickey ' s idea ?
and i think it ' s brilliant ! inspired ! the two leads of <person> ' s magnum opus get kidnapped ! the press ' ll eat it up ! they ' ll write about `gangster mickey , ' the glory days . couple a ' headlines like that and interest in atomic vampires will go through the roof ! who ' s gon na grab you ?

that ' s it ?
that ' s it . your brain was getting in the way .
hey .
so what ' s up ?
now just a second . we ' re not doing this for him !
oh no ! we ' re bringing the show down here to rehearse !
it ' s running three meters down . twenty knots .

you know <person> is in attica ?
he didn ' t have my lawyer .
i know and i ' m honored .
if anything ever happens to me .
my little thing on the internet is just a lark .
so it ' s still going on ?
<person> ! how could anyone listen to this crap ?
. live in exchange for sexual favors . police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls , all asians twelve to fifteen years old , who have been living in the north houston warehouse with a vietnamese pimp since february . the girls are being treated as victims , said police sergeant amos milburn . these are really just children , he said , but theyve been exposed to a lot already .
you ' re also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that ' ll never see a screen , regardless if it ' s leading lady gets `kidnapped ' or not .
this isn ' t the first time you ' ve spied on me .
the israelis can protect themselves . they got the <person> thing happening . <person> ' s for real , man . they scalp babies .
there ' s my point exactly .
hey , hey , hey . j . <person> would ' ve loved you . he ' d love anybody who joined the bureau to , what was it ? `` to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests '' ?
you crashed my file ?
no . no . we need to try our vaccine on it .
and if it ' s unsuccessful ?
oh no ! we ' re bringing the show down here to rehearse !
the company ' s been getting a little ragged . we ' d appreciate the use of the hall .
if i had died yesterday , you ' d have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if i carry any genetic predisposition toward violence .
what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
<person> . <continued_utterance> what ' s gotten into you ? <continued_utterance> ow !
what ' s the matter ?
theyandiacute ; re all asking how youandiacute ; re doing . are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone ? <continued_utterance> why ? you have a home here now , if you want it . everyone will .
what ? . miss me ? <person> , iandiacute ; m gon na walk out the front door and trust me , it wonandiacute ; t be soon enough for everyone here . <person> pulls a duffle bag out of the closet . logan can i , umm ?
but who was the devil ?
it ' s that woman from the coach !
yes . he came to discuss our friendship . i told him now was not the time .
so where is <person> now ?
i think you should .
well --
where ' s <person> ?
should be here any minute .
that ' s the sweat of a man who hasn ' t an honest bone in his body . <person> ' t be offended , lad . a man who ' s got no ethics is a free man . i envy that . <person> , how can i blame you ? that <person> sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , don ' t she ? eh ? jake nudges <person> who smiles a nervous smile . <continued_utterance> she does at that . i knew when i married her she was a free spirit . a woman with her looks and a man my age ; what was i to expect ? but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don ' t think , you do . so , i married her . what are you to do , eh ?
can ' t live with them , and you can ' t shoot ' em .
thelma , please get a hold of yourself . you ' re making a spectacle .
you know , <person> , you ' re supposed to be my best friend . you could at least be a little bit happy for me . you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isn ' t completely disgusting .
the match ! <continued_utterance> yes ! thank you , <person> !
whizzes right over them , blowing out the match .
no .
then you must be the one ' s a liar , right ? and you ' re a performer ?
would you object if i answered it for you ?
not at all , go right ahead . i ' ve got nothing to hide .
hi . i ' m okay . how are you ? long time no see .
<person> , honey . where are you ? you sound funny .
so what is it you do , mr . <person> ?
umm .
he wouldn ' t want any if you didn ' t try to keep it away from him .
because you were spoiled , don ' t try to spoil <person> .
just tell me what you want .
i dont need to explain anymoren i have . you know damn well .
i guess we see how bad we ' re stuck .
<person> ?
i ' m her husband . bobby husband . ? <continued_utterance> now who the hell are you , and it better be good , or god help me i ' ll break you in half .
<person> , chief . i . i was helping your wife . i met her in town . she needed a hand with her drapes . that ' s all .
do i act like a man who ' s joking ? !
<person> , <person> . i just can ' t believe you ' d block something like that out . <person> was at harvard with us . you turned him in for cheating .
that ' s right . <person> and water . terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for <person> . no more pressurized cities , no more containers in the desert . there ' ll be rivers , vegetation - life - the same as earth .
so why is <person> shipping everyone out ?
the heroine of pride and prejudice is <person> and she ' s one of the greatest , most complex characters ever written , not that you would know .
as a matter of fact i ' ve read it .
<person> ' t worry about it now .
<person> it , bb ! did you sign them ?
this is madness .
no doubt .
what ' s this i hear about you being unemployed ?
yes , but my condition is only temporary . i can change it .
follow him ? mr . gekko i . it ' s not what i do . i could lose my license . if the sec found out , i could go to jail . it ' s inside information , isn ' t it ?
inside information . oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline ? or someone overhears me saying i ' m gon na buy teldar paper ? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it ' s time to blow out xyz . you mean that ? i ' m afraid sport , unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company , you and i are gon na have a hard time doing any business .
it ' s okay . it ' s okay baby . cry for <person> . cry for <person> .
no it ' s not okay . it ' s not .
and you have conclusive evidence of this ? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
i hope to . we ' re working to develop this evidence --
<person> . i -
i donandiacute ; t like him being here .
my relationship with <person> is my own .
but you think about him -- it -- her .
the red rose . where is the red rose ? you know the light at sparkwood and <number> ? it worked right there . i just did it right there . <continued_utterance> why is it that you can ' t smoke at your home and i ' m a doctor and i don ' t allow smoking in my home and i let you smoke in my home ?
because you love me so much .

sun rises in the east . we go the opposite direction . may not find anything , but at least we ' ll know we ' re heading towards saudi arabia . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
yes .

he ' s not here .
he never came home last night . was he with you ?

this is the perfect time to panic ! i ' m lost , <person> is gone , they ' re going to move from their house in two days and it ' s all your fault ! !
my fault ? ! if you hadn ' t pushed me out of the window in the first place --
the job got thrown to me by this lawyer .
who is he ?
that ' s .
`` . for my father . ``
i don ' t know , but under no circumstances would i talk about it here . i want you to go home and relax the best you can . continue your life as if nothing has happened .
<person> , i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass .
i ' m used to spending a lot of time alone . i guess that ' s what i thought it would be out here . but , it ' s not is it ?
i ' m sorry i left you hanging up there .
then how the hell can you be in my dream -- if you know it ' s just a dream ?
i ' ve been artificially implanted -- like the first part of your fantasy . i ' m actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console . this is a last resort . when somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy , we send in someone after them . a specialist , like myself .
are you with me <person>dy ? <continued_utterance> i want you with me .

he ' s dead , <person> . believe me , i know a dead dog when i see one . <person> looks miserably at poe .

the russian army , they spend millions on flying skis , but they can not afford to pay the soldiers . the men , they do what they have to do to feed their families . in this country , for the right price and a pack of cigarettes , you can get anything you want . <continued_utterance> that too . everyone does what they can to survive .
so sensitive .
oh , come on , <person> . cut the kid some slack .
i think so .
<person> carefully . you will be lying to the man you love . the person who trusts you the most .

<person> . because for a minute there i thought we were talking about a fucking mask !
it ' s only a mask if you treat it that way .
where ?
i have to swing by a client ' s house and shut off the water .
you ' re right . our characters are obviously supposed to jump on each other . probably to create emotional tension when danger happens . no use fighting it .
what about our new identities ? do you feel yours yet ?
we understand your feelings , ms . <person> . but please , we ' d like some time with <person> . we ' d like to take her statement alone .
are you okay for this ? <continued_utterance> the man must be insane to think he can do this to me .
the professor said you were a solider . actually , i believe he used the word mercenary .
<person> ? well i donandiacute ; t like to talk about my past .
his name is dr . <person> . <person> of new york , class of twenty-six . bachelor of science ; new york college of medicine ; sixteenth in a class of twenty-two . <person> seventy-six got a courtesy appointment , staff of anesthesiology , <person> for women . <person> married . has no honors or degrees of any weight . since nineteen seventy- five he ' s testified in twenty-eight court cases , twelve malpractice . and he ' s black .
i ' m going to tell you how you handle the fact that he ' s black . you don ' t touch it . you don ' t mention it . you treat him like anybody else . neither better or worse . and you get a black lawyer to sit at our table . <person> . ?

i know it ' s crazy , <person> , but i just feel like i ' ve got a knack for this shit .
i believe you .
why don ' t you be a gentleman and ask <person> ?
who ?
what do you think ? `` the svartalfheim twist ? '' `` kiss of the hag ? '' `` <person> of boot ? '' <person> grins eagerly .
`` the flying mountain . `` <person> and fandral groan .
i may have seen her on campus .
not personally .
if we can find the hummer , or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay . we ' ve got enough water for that . but we won ' t make another day otherwise .
<person> how the war ' s going ?
wing , i need a bit more than that .
what ' s wrong with your wife ? she doesn ' t work ?
this road don ' t go to globe , <person> -- where were you going to meet me ?
it ' s not like that it . <person> , <person> , i got the money here . <continued_utterance> all talk , that ' s all you did was talk , and all i did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me ! you never did nothin ' <person> , you ' re weak !
<person> ?
i sure would .
- that <person> may be involved with <person> and <person> , and the missing <person> .
<person> . <person> chatter from a source you can ' t identify - who insists on talking only to <number> . nothing but loose talk and innuendo .
i think you do . <continued_utterance> at mi- <number> we call it <person> . it ' s common in kidnappings . a young impressionable victim . sheltered , sexually inexperienced . a powerful kidnapper skilled in torture , in manipulation . something snaps in the victim ' s mind . the captive falls in love with her captor .
how dare you ! how dare you ! that animal ! ? that monster ! ? he disgusts me ! you disgust me ! so he knew where to hurt you , is that it ? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral ! i didn ' t have to sleep with you to find that out .
forget it .
<person> has some deep pockets . that ' s all i ' m saying .
<person> , we are young , yes ? is the world not our oyster ? beaucoup des filles . do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl ?
i do , but . we ' ve come so far .
okay , okay , let ' er rip . suppose there ' s this guy . he ' s standing on the shore of a big , wide river . and the river ' s fulla all manner of disaster , like alligators and piranhas and currents and eddies , and most people won ' t even go down there to dip a toe . but on the other side of the river ' s a million dollars , and on this side of the river there ' s a rowboat . i guess my question ' s this : what would possess the guy on shore to swim for it ?
he ' s an idiot .
yes .
<person> ?
. said a lot of people , when they ' re dyin ' , they see this light , like in a tunnel . they say it ' s the light leading you to heaven .
really ? what about hell ? they got a sign or what ?
right .
<person> now . cases : <person> versus state of michigan .
you can ' t help them now . your job is to survive . she struggles to sit up .
no ! i will die a warrior ' s death . stories will be told of this day -- he gently takes her shield from her .
<person> , take the crutch . <continued_utterance> now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward . <continued_utterance> good ! now with the muscles in your left shoulder , pull your right leg .
one small bump and i ' ll land right on my keister !
no !
that ' s the truth ?
fbi , freeze , <person> -- drop it , drop it ! <continued_utterance> <person> around , put your hands on the roof of the truck .
you ' re the indian fbi .
<person> ? did you see that ?
she smiles at everyone , ted . she ' s like a newborn with gas . <continued_utterance> the only chick more untouchable than <person> is <person> . `` hi , my name ' s <person> . i love tofu burgers , rainy nights , and riding bareback . my biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex . `` here ' s a tip : set it on vibrate , honey , and don ' t be stingy with the lube . <person> ' t knock it till you tried it .

all of the creature comforts and vices you could possibly want , at home or abroad , available twenty- four hours a day .

i don ' t know about that .
i don ' t think you do . but you say you saw <person> die . i think you ' re covering his ass and he ' s still out there somewhere . i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . my bet is he ' s using you because you ' re stupid and you think he ' s your friend . you tell me he ' s dead , so be it . i want to make sure he ' s dead before i go back to new york .
<person> ' t worry , <person> . she ' s in good hands . you haven ' t made a mistake .

well , your mother seems very nice , though your father i think might be rather dim .
<person> and i share no blood links of any kind . <continued_utterance> sounds rather zealous .
i ' ve come to understand that . an ill advised purchase in the parking lot .
what do you want ?
you fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you , they arrange it .
what a stupid way to meet someone .
i think <person> or <person> .

that ' s a pretty ring .
<person> , <person> , the trip to <person> ; number sixty-two . and throw in that blonde . we ' ll give him a real good time .
sixty-two . and . the blonde . <continued_utterance> boy , is this one wild . he won ' t want to come back .

. whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
i do .
hh-uh . last time i saw it was .
and q huddle inside .

it ' s a tribute . a gesture .
a what ? <continued_utterance> <person> <number> page <number> <continued_utterance> vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet . <continued_utterance> your brain even smaller than ' em slits for eyes ? <continued_utterance> keep on banging out that ghetto ass shit and you ' ll alert every cop in podunk county .
that ' s it for you , pops !
<person> down , son . <person> , the ink is gone . <person> looks down at his shirt . the stain is gone . <continued_utterance> see ? it disappears .
<person> , you surprised me .
how was your ride ?
thanks , that ' s great .
<person> ?
absolutely not . my teeth are perfect . <person> ' t ask me how i knew this thing was in my mouth .
it probably wasn ' t until you ordered the special .
that was you ? <person> , are you out of your mind ?
i felt a grand gesture was required , darling .
who the fuck do you think you are ? where the fuck do you think you are ? why the fuck do you think i shouldn ' t just put you in a dumpster ?
i have money --
who ' s paying you to destroy the pipeline ?
to die by a man who can ' t even grasp what he ' s caught up in .
oh , really ? well , if i were you i ' d get myself some new friends !
what the hell are you guys looking for , anyway ?
heat , i think . the coincident invasion of a host , the fireman , and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six .
this man ' s still alive .
rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor . interesting . you got a card ?
my home number ' s on the back .
<person> fucker . he ' s wearing his tool belt .
what ? who ?
i ' m the only one who does . why do you think <person> ' s left me alone all this time ? <continued_utterance> i was the first one inside when they cracked the riddle of the sphinx . it must ' ve been programmed . some kind of . force . shot into me .
but <person> wiped your memory ! ! !
i don ' t think that is relevant , mr . <person> . the five of you are responsible for the murder of <person> and his bodyguards . mr . <person> can attest to your involvement , and we can see to it that he will . he is not of your superior breed .
this is a load of shit .
. this guy who said he was from the security exchange commission , whatever the hell that is , calls and wants to ask me about that stock i bought .
what ' d you tell him ?
we ' re doomed !
<person> ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> if i send out the troops , will you all calm down ?
oh , really ? and how would you know ?
i ' ve read plenty of books . the diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too rich . i ' m in favor of natural methods , mrs . breathmint .
macready ain ' t going nowhere . bunkered in till spring .
just go get him .
so . i guess we just divorce our spouses , marry each other , and have this baby , right ? <person> .
<person> .
why are you doing this ?
what have we have ? a red , no , crimson rose , tucked into the pages . something you read about in a book , no doubt . one of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff . she holds her hand out for it . kathleen give it to me . <continued_utterance> it ' s a joke to you , isn ' t it ? everything ' s a joke to you . <continued_utterance> you know what the handkerchief reminds me of ? the first day i met you --
must have been quite the spat .
i told you , i don ' t know him . i just want to make sure he ' s okay .
try it .
you first .
he might like it if he ever went there and tried it .
oh , have another cookie , marian -- keep your strength up .
can you come over ?
i can ' t . i really have a lot of work to do .
sure , and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with .
wes --
<person> ! is that who i think it is ?
<person> , that ' s her . she ' s something , isn ' t she ?
oh .
it ' s okay . i ' m not really worried .

i ' m sorry , this is -- -- this is very , very expensive . it ' s -- tell him this is an expensive watch .
<person> , i ' m driving away now and i don ' t want you to bother me again . you came for my advice , correct ?
absolutely .

um -- no , <person> . i don ' t .
<person> had a ring . any idea what happened to it ?

three different guys ?
well i ' m guessing . there ' s a black kid , two whites , and a midget .
<person> ! hi ! <person> has already hung a u . <person> comes through the gate and up to the jeep . <continued_utterance> what ? you ' re going to drive off without even saying hi ?
hi , <person> .
<person> . i was kind of wondering what happened to you today .
oh -- <person> ' t <person> -- i had a false alarm about my son .
you remember . about women .
<person> --
<person> , <person> , this is something we came up with ?
yeah , that ' s right . so now that you know , you understand why it ' s important that we get it back .
what are you going to do ?
i ' ll be all right . you just do as i say .
you look at them with the same repulsion and pity as everyone else .
<person> ' t be ridiculous . i resent your trying to --
lead man .
i ' ll get something for us to drink --
there ' s no body , and nothing was taken except <person> .
he does know how to delegate doesn ' t he . and also i ' m sure that poor negro ' s nosedive has put you squarely in his debt .
helen , i want you to be my wife .
i ' m married !
<person> .
<person> morning .
the carter boy . tell me about him .
he wants help with his lines --
and you agreed ?
yes .
you carry a gun , you consort with people being chased by killers . i hate to break it to you , but --
<person> , i ' m a criminal . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean for things to turn out like this . i always lived by a certain code . but then . i broke it .
he had no right to do that .
you do love him , don ' t you ?
have you seen <person> ?
no . is the war over ?
you ' re a police officer . <person> ' t you going to take a report or something ? <person> ' t you want to know what kind of car it is ?
it ' s a <person> --
what do i know , eh ? <person> needs a victory very badly . he needs to prove to <person> that he is still winning . he thinks <person> ' s death is the proof he needs .
<person> don ' t need proof . he just sent twenty-five million in new arms to <person> . i ' m sorry . almost got it here .
you working on someone right now ?
i always have a couple on the hook . you know . there ' s one right now , i ' ve got her panting like a dog . it ' s great .
ok . i ' ll drop you off .
so when wrestling ' s over i have to go ?

<person> , would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night ?
we do .
to oz ?
what ' d you see , <person> ?
tell him !
oh , you ' ll be with me . no question of that . i am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community . a community based not on birthright or privilege , but on compassion and courage . the true power of these waters is that they brought us all together . our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure . our ability to survive . despite the odds .
ranklin looks out at the sea of faces .
he gave you an infected bioport so that my pod would die and so would my game-system .
i ' m infected ? wait a minute !

who buys classified reports for three million pounds .
it ' s a report on weapons security in the former soviet union , which , as you know , is shaky at best . he ' s had several instances of sabotage at the pipeline , and he ' s understandably concerned . he called me the moment he realized its sensitive nature .
