<person> , if you have work to do , you go right ahead . i mean , to tell you the truth , i ' d love to see your work .
<person> ! what would you like me to do ?
i have little interest in your quaint vessel , captain . if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years , it will not be harmed .
you know that ' s not possible .
well , maybe you weren ' t .
<person> , when i said i couldn ' t channel you . that didn ' t mean i wouldn ' t give my right arm to do just that . <continued_utterance> maybe i don ' t want to be looking over my shoulder . every day for twenty years . knowing someone else would have done it right . the way i can ' t .
i guess .
well , let ' s go have some champagne , shall we ? toast all the newlyweds .
cause she doesn ' t look at me like everybody and i don ' t want her to .
know what ?
and there ' s no way to penetrate his cloak ?
no , sir .

<person> ' t play innocent . somebody named <person> .
<person> ?
get out of there !
i can ' t see .
the guy we are looking for is not a ruse .
what ' s ruse mean ?
but he isn ' t going to like this , <person> . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i wouldn ' t give him a second thought if not for you .
<person> ' s forget him and -
<person> `` thou shall not kill '' ?
or maybe , it can ' t <continued_utterance> i don ' t know . that ' s the point .
she sings too ?
constantly . without doubt . and plays the lute , she has a natural ear . and her bosom -- did i mention her bosom ?
there ' s no one on board , sir . according to the log , the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff . it must be a decoy , sir . several of the escape pods have been jettisoned .

all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?
come on , <person> .
<person> . you ' d have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no mcp looking over your shoulder .
when you ' ve been in the system as long as i have , you hear many promises . many reassurances . many brave plans . <continued_utterance> who is your user , program ?
well , wait now . i still have to ask <person> if i can go .
you mean you haven ' t asked him yet ? for christ sake , thelma , is he your husband or your father ? it ' s just two days . for god ' s sake , thelma . <person> ' t be a child . just tell him you ' re goin ' with me , for cryin ' out loud . tell him i ' m havin ' a nervous breakdown .

the secret service agent . offed himself .
<person> , guilt , s . we know . we are <person> .
<person> , si . <person> , si .
she ' s not real either , is she ? nothing here is . nothing here matters . all euphoria is now gone from kirk -- it ' s a moment of self-revelation . he glances around . <continued_utterance> it ' s kinda like . orbital skydiving . exciting for a few minutes . but in the end , you haven ' t really done anything . you haven ' t made a difference . <continued_utterance> captain of the enterprise , huh ?

did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon ?

oh my . meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week in <person> machines and i ' m not seeing one dime .
i still don ' t get why you ' re trying to break into the system .
<person> seeing the good side of <person> . so she ' ll see the good side of us . <continued_utterance> because i ' m looking ahead . and you know what i see . ? <person> doesn ' t . but she sure is listening . <continued_utterance> time will come . when we all need to be there . for each other . <continued_utterance> that happens . to families .

<person> , one night , around sunset , i went horseback riding with the nuns . they went every night . and , well , we ' re trotting pretty hard , y ' know ? the hard leather saddle , pounding between my legs .
i just got a little squishy .
yes . some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony .
oh !
<person> .
. tell morgan to play games -- it ' s okay to be silly .
<person> , i feel exhausted . what do you want me to do ?
not what you ' re doing now . at least don ' t ask me - don ' t ask him . you ' re fighting for your life !
she was hot .
she really didn ' t do it for me , baby .
<person> up and take the ten .
there was a diner scene earlier . with a waitress .
<person> ?
come .
who are you ?
you already have that information , captain . now think . recall my name .
are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on me ?
they only work on the weak-minded .
are you joking , man ? let ' s see here . she dated <person> , <person> , <person> and what ' s-his-face . all of those were cool guys . she ' s been hot way longer than you think . why would she end her high school career with me ?
well , <person> got with <person> .
. sir .
the professor , where ' s his boat ?
<person> , it ! we need it !
we ' re better off by ourselves .
i haven ' t been here for a long time .
it ' s still the same . small and ugly . but then again it ' s small and ugly . are you sure we shouldn ' t find you some nice lady-like hotel ?
sure . everything okay ?
i ' m pregnant .
but you have that ' look ' . i can always tell . you haven ' t got into any more mischief , <person> ? <continued_utterance> i do hope you ' ve forgotten about that silly little plan of yours ?
which one ?
of course . <person> .
and co . a lot of co . oh , <person> , i ' ve thought about you so much .
he ' s just a boy . obi-wan can no longer help him .
the force is strong with him . the son of skywalker must not become a jedi .
silence , <person> ! <continued_utterance> you must learn patience , commander . do you know where i learned it ? in the dilithium mines of remus . spend eighteen hours every day under the lash of a <person> guard ' s whip and you ' ll soon understand patience .
<person> .
the droid belongs to her . she ' s the one in the message . we ' ve got to help her .

<person> , snyder . what are you doin ' up here ?
i ' m on vacation . you seen your friend lately ?
the battery ' s in , that ' s done with . besides , you ' d do the same for m .
.
and how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings ?
listen to me . you can not hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it won ' t work out and maybe you ' ll become unglued . that ' s not a way to live .
what ' re you saying - that all these abductions are the work of one guy ? do you know how fucking insane that is ? ! not let ' s try something that actually makes sense : he sends in these faxes , picks off three scumbags . for what ? ! so we ' ll think exactly what you ' re thinking right now - that we ' ve got a friend out there , somebody willing to take out the garbage for the rest of us . and it ' s all horse-shit !
what if it isn ' t ? what if there really is a zero out there and o ' <person> ' s the one guy who ' s got a shot at him ?
rejecting me .
purely preventive . it ' s not anything you ' ve done .
so he was mean ?
no . not mean . just . very angry .

i agree .
is that your experience . ?
yes . it is . nonetheless , we tried to match it to a current photo . <continued_utterance> . she was there twelve hours ago .
look she ' s upset --
no i ' m not . i don ' t care . why should i care ? i mean nobody asked me when you got divorced . <person> asked me if i wanted a new mother . <person> even asked me if i like her . if you guys don ' t care about our family staying together , why sh .
he ' s dead <person> .
i feel sick .
once i dispose of you , spider-man , no one will be able to stop me .
stop you from what . ?
but everything that ' s happening is good ! you can be a part of it !
a part of what ? <person> , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party . <continued_utterance> page <number> . <continued_utterance> you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how . fortunate .
what do you think you ' re doing ?
i ' m rescuing you .
<person> .
<person> .

hey , hey . how do you get there ?
yes you do . be honest .
give him the hammer , ted .
what is it , your back give out ?
pushing her hair over her eyes . means she ' s avoiding a confrontation . <continued_utterance> if she ' s twirling it , she ' s playing something out in her mind . if she ' s stopped combing it , she might be depressed .
what about obsessively picking her split ends ?
what are you , fuckin ' geologist ?
he ' s right , it ain ' t .
i , erm , i ' m on my way to , erm , my bird ' s <person> .
<person> ' t worry about it , we ' ll only be about ten minutes .

my <person> !
that ' s <person> , <person> , i ' ve served with him . <continued_utterance> brain disturbance . appears to be drug induced . he reaches into his kit . he shoots <person> moves off to <person> . <person> , voice continues in the b . g .

<person> , what are you doing here ?
okay , nobody make a move . <number> int . vax buren lobby - right <number> s <person> and <person> walk from the elevators .

you could have both though .
are you in trouble over this , mr . <person> ? can <person> do something to you ?
i ' m <number> , starling . if i found <person> on national tv , i ' d still have to retire in two years . it ' s not a consideration . but you are . you ' ve done enough . if i keep you out of school any longer , you ' ll be recycled . cost you six months , at least . i can guarantee you readmission here , but that ' s about it . <person> ' s your chance , starling . go back to class . <person> to me .
no , i didn ' t .
i thought it ' d be a surprise .
how do you know you saw it ?
i don ' t know .
no . it ' s me . you ' re the new helper , huh .
i didn ' t mean to .
what is this ? why are you talking like that ? is this some kind of script ?
if <person> , the middle eastern man , is innocent , as you maintain , who might be the guilty party ?
miranda and i are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie .
<person> .
yes , you got ta .

i have these strange thoughts , i don ' t know where they come from . i can ' t explain it .
neither can i . not any of it . there ' s no reference point for what ' s going on ; it ' s never happened before . it ' s a clean break in the fabric of the universe ; a gap . there is nothing to do but experience it , moment-to- moment , and not let it destroy us .
i got ta ! <person> , i run some slots down in west bend for a mob here . i got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure i been holdin ' out on ' em . they gave me to <number> : <number> to come up with the cash . i don ' t get it there i ' m dead .

about a year ago , you asked me to do a favor . it was a thing - well , i never did a thing that dirty in all my life . <person> , totally disinterested in <person> ' s problems of conscience , signals to his car again , walks past <person> , who continues rapidly : <continued_utterance> <person> , that brings us up to five weeks ago . `` <person> , i got a nasty little problem here . `` did i say no ? i ' m frank to admit - it don ' t jell as fast as we like . but all of a sudden i can ' <person> you on the phone no more ! why ? . and why , as of this date , am i frozen out of the column .

<person> , <person> , but i ' ve given up writing on spec .
oh , fuck .
oh , god . i ' m sorry . <person> alarm . <person> , no , i ' m sure . no , he ' s not a burglar he ' s dating my daughter .
that bastard ! people by the lakeside:
who ' s the bastard , <person> ? <person> ? <continued_utterance> why ? he promised to remove your file ? <continued_utterance> and what about before that ? what were you a member of in austria ? <continued_utterance> was a member of . ? speak up ?
yes , that ' s what happened .
i have a different story to tell . i don ' t think you were tricked . not in the way you describe . i believe something else happened . i ' ve seen the hinkel archive , i ' ve seen records of phone calls , and putting it all together , this is what i think happened . i think <person> said , ' <person> , if you won ' t conduct for <person> ' s birthday , we ' ll get the miracle kid , the guy that critic , von der <person> , thinks is the greatest conductor in the world . he ' s not just willing to conduct for <person> , he ' s offered to sing `` <person> birthday '' as a solo . ' silence . <continued_utterance> come on , admit it . k worried you , didn ' t he ? he always worried you . in <number> , he ' s thirty-four years old , you ' re already fifty-six . and <person> and goering keep saying to you , ' if you don ' t do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i don ' t care how great you are . it ' s the oldest story in the book , the ageing <person> jealous of the young buck . the real reason you didn ' t leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you ' d be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party ' s boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
can you at least pretend to be like you used to be ? give me some comfort ?
. there are all different ways you can tell that there ' s someone really there watching out for us . you see signs . sometimes they ' re little ones . you think of someone . the phone rings . they ' re on the phone . sometimes they ' re big , like fourteen lights hovering over mexico city . sure , there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing . but there are a lot of people watching this , who think it ' s a miracle . a sign of god ' s existence . it ' s all in how you look at things <person> . what you have to decide is what kind of person you are ? are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes , things just happen by chance ?
we need something to wedge against the doorknob .
they ' ll read our minds !
having a heart is not the point . we were hardly taken in . we believed him -- for a few hours . he did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did . he wanted to be your child . <person> ' t let that go . he sat out in that park and said that man is my father . he ' s in trouble and we don ' t know how to help him .
help him ? he could ' ve killed me . and you . the guests agree .
hey , <person> , i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me .
oh , yeah . no . i mean yeah , i stopped by for a drink . <person> ' t see you .
but tell me , judge , after you ' ve sentenced a man to the chair , isn ' t it difficult to go and eat your dinner after that ?
young man , when a murderer is caught , he must be tried . when he is convicted , he must be sentenced . when he is sentenced to death , he must be executed .
during an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in <person> , <person> , the minister of armaments , said to me , ' you look very tired dr . <person> , you should go abroad for a while . ' i knew exactly what he meant .
you sure knew a lot of people in high places .
i ' ll be around .
that ' s not good enough . i want to make plans to see you .
`` come hither , man . i see that thou art poor . <person> , there is forty ducats . let me have a dram of poison -- ''
`` such mortal drugs i have but <person> ' s law is death to any he that utters them ! '' <continued_utterance> `` my poverty but not my will consents . ``
what ?
i told them what you said about the script .
i was your choice , dr . <person> . you chose to speak to me . would you prefer someone else now ? or perhaps you don ' t think you can help us .
that is both impudent and untrue . tell me , how did you feel when you viewed our <person> ' s latest effort ? or should i say , his `` next-to-latest '' ?
<person> ' , huh ? guy with a wife and kids keepin ' bodies in his attic ? he nods . but what is she doing out here ?
yeah . you okay ?
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape . how did you do that ?
i don ' t remember in detail , there were so many .
<person> , how are you ?
i ' m doing good , good . you look great . did you lose some weight ?
what ?
i ' ve got a show -- at st . <person> ' s cathedral . we ' re singing for the cardinals .
i hope you ' ll come and see us .
that ' s very kind .
/ you don ' t know when to stop ! you ' re an idiot . i ' m not having nothing to do with it .
otherwise my whole life ' ll go by and i ' ll be washed up and thirty four like my mum and no one decent will ever even have snogged me !
<person> , call for back-up . <person> , you all right ?
i don ' t think so .
<person> ?
i mean , you handle some pretty rough traffic , huh ?
it sounds like the uso show has started . we have precious little time .
oh my god .
there was a car crash , sweetie . and they found . you know , the body . of her friend .
<person> .
in front of someone is different .
i don ' t see why .
no , nyet , negatory , not on your tintype , no way .
oh . anything else ?
<person> loved to see his kids in the bus . they always sat in the back , so they could wave to each other .
from what ?
probably .
over six feet ?
shifty .
<person> mate .
why attack russia ?
because <person> knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here .
that might not be so bad . at least for you .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
we ' ll have the whole lodge to ourselves practically .
i can ' t wait , <person> .
get him on the phone .
he ' s on the island , he ' ll be back on .
i ' m picking up life signs . about twenty meters ahead .
that rules out klingons . <continued_utterance> they would not have left anyone alive .
has he ?
you know he has . you ' re not a complete fool , are you ?
i know that . but the buses don ' t go there .
what is hitchhike ?
i don ' t .
you didn ' t see it .
report from crawler one . everything under control . no need for assistance .
there ' s resistance ?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
<person> !
yeah .
maybe i ' ll see you again sometime , huh ?
<person> , <person> . <person> ' s not get goofy . we got no thin , but good news here .
i must say , you do look good . considering . you have a little extra baggage under your eyes , but i know how to fix that .
the chancellor means well , <person> ' lady but he is incompetent . he has promised to cut the bureaucracy , but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever , no ? senator , the republic can not be fixed . it is time to start over . the democratic process in the republic is a sham , a shell game played on the voters . it will not be long before the cult of greed , called the republic , will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom .
i can not believe that . i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic . i know of your treaties with the trade federation , the commerce guilds , and the others , count . what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business . it ' s business becoming government !
. i will .
. <person> --
there ' s no reason to be nasty .
you think this is nasty ? in case you haven ' t heard . the cia has no charter to operate domestically . <person> puts you in violation of federal law .
<person> , i never ever met anybody like you before .
i can believe that .
are you a detective , lieutenant ?
yes sir .

i don ' t want to know this .
oh my god -- <continued_utterance> he ' s not coming . oh my god .

oh yeah . sure . <continued_utterance> you know , in life you got ta strike when the iron ' s hot .
to fall in love . <continued_utterance> what ? that ' s corny , right ?
no , it ' s just -- so -- honest . i don ' t think i ' ve ever heard anyone say that in a long time . <continued_utterance> well . <person> from st . <person> . i have just one more question . how does an unemployed girl with three roommates afford the patchwork denim bowley <person> vuitton bag ?
we appreciate your desire for further discussion . perhaps at a later date .

that he ' d keep an eye on miyamoto .
but you see what i ' m getting at ? you get a gorgeous house , you ' re highly paid . what are you gon na do , stay or leave ? one voice comes back at me : stay !
major , that ' s not a good argument . if dr . <person> did indeed enjoy all these . these privileges , he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is . that ' s true of any leading artist in any country in the world .
<person> to hear , <person> .

hi , <person> ?

just this one part , okay ? `` i have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as i or anyone else can remember , and i guarantee you will not get one past me ''

molecular-memory .
gim me a minute here . i think i ' ve got it .
do you ?
hello , darling . have you had your dinner ?
on the train .
mrnmm , yeah . but not really . it shifts around a lot . <person> you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father . and some other stuff happens , some parallel narrative , and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a robbe-grillet mystery -- you know , with no real resolution .
<person> . <person> , i think it ' s amazing you ' re getting it published . really . i know how hard it is . just to write it even .
integrity - acute , like indigestion .
what does that mean - integrity ?
as stories must when love ' s denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder . <continued_utterance> <person> , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it ' s time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
fifty shillings . pounds .

i don ' t think so .
<person> , this is me . i ' m going to take a look .
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both .
<person> , ask your own manager - he ' s standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife . so how do you get him doing j . j . a favor ?

they took it apart with a tweezers .
that ' s between you and yourself , norma .
you think i made that up about the gun . <continued_utterance> see , you didn ' t believe me ! . now i suppose you don ' t think i have the courage !

<person> ?
you don ' t know that lunatic yet ? <person> - egotistic whims ! like the gag - when you got him for a friend , you don ' t need an enemy ! that ' s what the fight with <person> was about . `` leo '' , i says , `` hunsecker froze me out . so i ' m eating humble pie this month - please print me an item . ``

that ' s where the popcorn business comes in . you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears .
<person> ! you mean . you feel afraid ? that ' s when you ' re in battle . what about other times ? now , for example ?
<person> .
i know , but i thought maybe i could .

see that guy ? the one with the ramrod up his ass . that ' s strickland . <continued_utterance> take it to him .
you still don ' t believe in <person> ?
the whole idea of <person> was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man . even the limits we put on it are human limits . it can do this , it can do that ! it designs , it creates !

<person> .
what do you think ?
very subtle and very pink . must have cost some subtle bucks .
it was like telling her . <continued_utterance> . that i didn ' t love her anymore . <continued_utterance> . if i could be sure i ' d always stay . <continued_utterance> she said , ' this thing you call a partnership . the schedules , the chores , all the things we have to work out . ' <continued_utterance> ' . for the kids . ' <continued_utterance> ' . that ' s the life i dreamed of . and it ' s all i ever wanted it to be . ' she swallows . because she will not cry . <continued_utterance> that ' s the kind of person your mom is . she ' s the best . <continued_utterance> i complained a lot , baby . we couldn ' t travel , we ' d lost our privacy , our chance to do things on the spur of the moment . to live for . ourselves . the way we ' d started out . <continued_utterance> and she said . sounds like you ' d be happier . if the kids weren ' t around . <continued_utterance> i said . i love them more than anything . but sometimes . i do miss what i ' ve lost . <continued_utterance> she said she could never feel that way , not for one single second . <continued_utterance> she didn ' t want to be with someone . who could . <continued_utterance> you know , this horse smells really bad .
there ' s worse things .
there ' s nothing to forgive . in fact , i should thank you . it helped me grow up a lot and see how stupid i was .

hey eddie . what have you got ?
water balloon .

<person> ' s job is she works .
yes , exactly , but his first , his first conclusion was that <person> was killed not later than seven o ' clock yesterday evening .
well , he certainly wasn ' t dead when he drove off in his car .
<person> ' t got a thing .
any kind of assignment . additional dialogue .
well , i ' m just beginning to develop my theme . <person> ' t that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? <person> , so they played on your insecurity . that ' s human , understandable . but , there is one guy who doesn ' t like little k as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , <person> . he thinks you ' re the greatest , and when he says , i want <person> for my birthday , boy , they better go out get <person> . so , <person> calls and threatens you with little k . and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna , i ' ll give it to <person> as a birthday present in berlin . that ' s the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . <person> . <person> did you stay ? <person> did you play for them ? <person> were you the flag-carrier for their regime ? <person> ?

she was a human being . let me remind you that even the most unworthy of us has the right to life and the pursuit of happiness .

because somewhere . in one of those memories . is the evidence . if i got in far enough , i could reconstruct it . <continued_utterance> my password . <person> ' s instruction to divert the data .
i ' m afraid it ' s a little late for that . <person> ' s shut off group <number> access . he must know what you ' re up to .
<person> .
<person> . good ?
it ' s foolproof . we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union . race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies . all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner . then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that ' s already been run . it can ' t miss , unless the western union dicks get onto it . <person> is amazed . he sits back a second , then comes

you badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won ' t even consider forgiving <person> for something he did six months ago .
you sober ?
i can talk , can ' t i ? <continued_utterance> glad to meet ya , kid . you ' re a real horse ' s ass .
it ' s not fair . i have to hide every erection i get .
sometimes i get boners so big i can ' t hide them . and then i get nervous and my heart starts pounding , and it all just , like , feeds my boner . it just becomes this . thing . that ' s attached to me . and it won ' t go away .

maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in . and then all of a sudden , it ' s all taken away . no one asked them . it ' s just gone .
<person> , the message said <person> . `` my name is <person> '' . my name isn ' t <person> .
no , it isn ' t . your name is <person> . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the one you couldn ' t save . what was his name ? `` <person> , we ' re going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . `` `` but i don ' t want to go swimming , <person> . i ' m scared . `` `` c ' mon , <continued_utterance> when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i can ' t get <person> on the radio . i ' m in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . `` was it really the squid that was attacking you , <person> -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ? <continued_utterance> i ' m not scaring you , am i <person> ? i hope i ' m not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , don ' t you ?

we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor .
you know something ? you should ' ve written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than <person> . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic ' s taken over by <person> and his propaganda ministry but <person> is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?
glenn <person> . the golf pro at the falmouth hills country club . the man you had recently discovered was her lover . did you follow her ?
i went to a few bars first . later , i decided to drive to mr . <person> ' s home and confront them . they weren ' t there . so i parked my car in the turnout . and waited .
the fact that you two are remarrying obviously has <person> overjoyed . and she ' s very excited about your move to switzerland .

it may be that - i could confer with my colleagues on this . and get back to you .
we want you to be there tonight . a beat , costa smiles . realizes she ' s serious .

my lord , the fleet has moves out of light-speed . com-scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the hoth system . the field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment .
the rebels are alerted to our presence . admiral ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system .
she coulda killed me last night .
too many people coulda seen ya go in her room . she was a professional . used to work in the dutch schultz gang .
not on the landscape . we ' re trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it ' s hard going .

welcome home , <person> . you have done well .
i bring you good news , my lord .

yeah .
i thought i was going to die .
<person> , i got ta tell you something . <person> ' s coming to the wedding .
i know . you told me . i ' m okay with it .

it ' s over , sir , the storm has cleared .

you listen to the feelings , not the words .
right down to the ground . <person> ' s get to it .
you put filth in my child ' s mouth .
yeah .
we ' ve already both done everything we can to screw it up . <continued_utterance> is that a smile i ' m hearing ?
i mean , accepts it .
if that ' s what you want . a non threatening woman , who won ' t get your number , you get to run the show .
we ' re japanese , not mexican , ishmael . he ' ll slice you up with a ceremonial sword . <continued_utterance> my mom . would be the problem .
why ? we ' re only talking .
i wrote an open letter to the newspapers condemning what they were doing to music , making these distinctions between jews and non- jews . for my part , the only divide in art is between good and bad . eventually , <person> summoned me and told me i could leave the country if i wanted to but under no condition would i ever be allowed to return . i always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without . i asked myself , what ' s the duty of an artist , to stay or to leave ? and then <person> demanded that i acknowledge <person> as solely responsible for cultural policy . well , that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it . i simply acknowledged that <person> and the minister of <person> appointed by him were solely responsible for the cultural policy of the reich . what i wanted to express was that i , personally , had no responsibility whatsoever for their cultural policy . i have always had the view that art and politics should . should have nothing to do with each other .

you know who they are , don ' t you ? do you know how many there ' ll be ?
. wait till she lifts off , take him outside and shoot him .
. why can ' t the girl go home ?
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
it never solves anything .
i knew we would be together forever , and that everything would be wonderful , just the way you feel about <person> . <person> . it ' s quite a formal name , isn ' t it ? one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time . in the sack i believe you call it --
<person> !
they probably don ' t have to speak because they ' re connected .
or they ' re just bored with one another .
oh , shit .

<person> , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?

who ' d ever try driving cattle over table-top ? -- unless they were crazy .
i don ' t agree with you . in any case -- if you must have it -- i ' d no intention of engaging a man at foreman ' s wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman !
you talk to <person> ?
he left this morning . he couldn ' t say where .
i ' m not letting you go out there .

it ' s okay . `cos i ' m going this way .
hey man , he ' s going uptown .
she hasn ' t mentioned this .
she was afraid you ' d make a big deal out of it .
go to the symphony -- a beat .
we will ? the symphony ? okay . i ' ll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni .
they leave it out all night ?
not worth stealing . only thing in town worth something . <person> glass window .
but he ' ll own it . so . you are keeping your own place , right ?
oh , miranda , please , i haven ' t figured out all the details yet , but i ' m a smart girl and i ' m sure i ' ll figure out something i ' m comfortable with .
<person> . can you get her ?
no problem . take a few weeks .
goodbye .
it ' s that ignorant lunk isn ' t it ?
like the papers said . we have hearts .
having a heart is not the point . we were hardly taken in . we believed him -- for a few hours . he did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did . he wanted to be your child . <person> ' t let that go . he sat out in that park and said that man is my father . he ' s in trouble and we don ' t know how to help him .
<person> called . he says you ' re checking out . of the heartbreak hotel . <continued_utterance> she likes a stolie , no ice .
<person> .
ten thousand ? we could almost buy our own ship for that !
but who ' s going to fly it , kid ! you ?
what am i gon na do ?
you got to tell ' em that you saw the accident . <person> ' t you ?
the same , alas .
oh but why `` alas ? ''
i don ' t think so .
do you owe anybody money ? you can tell me off the record if you need too .
you haven ' t told bedtime stories before ?
no .
different how ?
i don ' t know . just different . like the food is really sweet .
all .
maybe i ' ll close early . cash or charge ? <continued_utterance> <person> , i can ' t sell the ammo with the guns . you ' ll have to -- -hey ! <continued_utterance> you can ' t to that .
exactement !
i ' m having the salmon .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> , are you all right ?
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays .
if that ' s what you want . a non threatening woman , who won ' t get your number , you get to run the show .
i think our relationship is growing by the way . have you noticed ? <continued_utterance> i ' m serious . maybe we just needed to get out of the house . now , you may notice , interestingly , we ' re walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again .
shit ! this is not happening . <continued_utterance> <person> , i ' m sorry . i thought . i thought you were following me .
that ' s all right .
somebody left the unit on . if everyone else was dead , it implies that no one remained to turn it off . those people back there bought escape time for genesis with their lives .
it doesn ' t make sense . these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless .
<person> dressed , you are a sore thumb , and you endanger us all . while you are here , you will conduct yourself as a nun . only i shall know who , and what , you truly are . you will not disrupt the convent . you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk . you will draw no attention to yourself in any way .
but look at rites look at this ! i ' m a nun ! i ' m invisible ! i ' m a penguin !
and i love poetry above all .
<person> ? <continued_utterance> my lord -- when you can not find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse . <continued_utterance> but playwrights teach nothing about love , they make it pretty , they make it comical , or they make it lust . they can not make it true .
what do you mean ?
people who will help our cause .
i was attempting to . get in the spirit of things . i thought it would be humorous .
<person> . you ' re not thinking about using that thing are you ?
what . what do they want ?
nothing .
yes . absolutely . despite your crass behavior , i ' m really glad we ' re finally getting this time together .
<person> .
i have to go , mom . the lady is calling me . smells like dinner .
<person> ? <person> ' t forget who your real mother is , <person> . are you going to prefer her cooking to mine now ?
stop thanking me . i love having the company .
it was an adventure which i ' ll remember .
just lucky , admiral .
<person> ' s hope that luck holds . <person> out . the transmission ends .
you are not .
he is .
you ' re tough , all right .
you ' re on your own . stop being chicken-hearted and write that story .
how ' s she doing with <person> ?
can i say one thing ? i mean , the <continued_utterance> yah ? well , even the best mom in the world , the smartest , the wisest , whatever . needs to know when to find a plan b . <person> a is not and will n .
please don ' t leave us , <person> . these people need your help .
i ' m not leaving , threepio . i just can ' t sleep .
it ' s hard to imagine .
what are you going to do , <person> ?
she ' s dead . <person> says nothing . then : her finger twitches .
she ' ll come back , don ' t worry . but then what ? my theory is she can only live here , that she will die if she leaves this ship . <continued_utterance> why do you think she hasn ' t suggested that ? it ' s the most obvious solution : <person> . she knows she can ' t leave here --
we do talk the same language -- don ' t we , <person> ?
sure , we talk the same language .
the daughter of his enemy .
the daughter of his enemy .
he ' s probably lying though .
i bet he ' s lying .
that ' s what <person> said . on <person> . you , me and <person> .
<person> ! we can have ice cream from <person> ' s .
<person> happened before .
<person> happened before .
thanks . we ' re expecting our second in a couple of months . <continued_utterance> how are you ? you look just the same .

it ' s about <person> i ' ve watched him with the b- <number> and i ' m troubled . <person> ' s desire for a `` family '' is very strong . i ' m afraid he may be investing too much in the b- <number> .
you ' re speaking of emotional investment ?
what was what ?
what ' s with you ?
they ' ll love it in pomona .
they will love it every place . read it . read the scene just before she has him killed !
it ' s been quite a ride . <person> , i thought maybe i ' d hear from you when it opened . where ' ve you been ?
after i saw you in the theater that afternoon , i had another `` episode .
`` sin from my lips ? oh trespass sweetly urg ' d . give me my sin again . ``
yes yes er not quite right it is more let me `` then have my lips the sin that they have took . ``
the last cell has been taken down . it was <person> . i took him out .
what makes you so sure he was the last cell ?
why ? so you can beat yourself up ? sitting around in that stuffy apartment . it ' s just plain bad for you , man . it ' s depressing . you ' ve come so far . remember the first week ? after she told you ? you couldn ' t even eat .
<person> ' t remind me .
<person> and <person> in play .

c ' mon there , old boys ! <person> ' like molasses ! <person> ' me look bad !
we liked him immediately .
what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ? huh ?
who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . <person> up , he ' s probably in purgatory by now . <person> makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again .
<person> ? your were worried about moi ?
we were worried about you and this affair with your boss .
but of course .
<person> or surrounded ?
<person> -- she comes at him , needle in hand .
it ' s your choice . because it ' s not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .
it ' s a little derivative .
what do you mean ?
how do you hold down a job ? it ' s <number> : <number> . you were supposed to be here at <number> : <number> .
this is friday , her riding lesson is on tuesdays . i got it right here .

she ' ll be easier to print if we turn her over . <person> , will you give me a hand ?
that ' s right ! there ' s no way i ' m going to finish the new processor now . forget it . i ' m out of it . i ' m quitting <person> tomorrow .

you have to give them your phone number or they won ' t let you go on the air . <continued_utterance> `` dear sleepless in seattle : i am an swf '' -- what is that ?
the battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet . it ' s defenses are designed around a direct large- scale assault . a small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense .
<person> me for asking , sir , but what good are snub fighters going to be against that ?
that ' s right .

survivors ? no , i wouldn ' t think so .
then why am i here ?
that ' s a bit strong isn ' t it ?
you wouldn ' t have a problem if it was a person .
perhaps .
i must tell the cardinal . i . <number> send him a personal letter , describing your efforts , your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive .
<person> , you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life ? why i ' m always with the wrong guy ? this is why . because the wrong guy can ' t do this to you . you have some control with the wrong guy . this thing i ' m feeling right now . this is my big fear . that some guy could get me unglued like this , like nothing ' s connected . and this is just my father ! i ' m just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama .
the drama in life is what makes you strong .
oh , me-me-me , mine ' s great .
proceed , <person> .
oh , you ' re his attorney , too ?
later for you , pal .
does it ever bother you ?
i don ' t run the scams , <person> , i just process the profits . that ' s a fine line , maybe . but i ' ve also built that library , and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas . why do you think the warden lets me do all that ?
hi .
does it have to be an old <person> ? where have you been ?
and when did you last see <person> ?
a few days ago .
i got that boy coming over here . what ' s so funny ?
with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good .

-- that ' s what they ' re telling me .
what does <person> already know ?
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t be going down . thinks it ' s a mistake . <continued_utterance> she told me what you said , <person> .
but honey , i need to know where i can reach you or i ' ll be worried sick . it turns out i can ' t stay up here . the electricity ' s off . and i don ' t know just where i ' ll be .
<person> , here ' s the number . are you ready ?

it looks like <person> did this , all right . <person> , here are gaffi sticks , <person> tracks . it ' s just . i never heard of them hitting anything this big before .
they didn ' t . but we are meant to think they did . these tracks are side by side . <person> always ride single file to hide there numbers .
which part ?

one possible future . four your point of view . i don ' t know the tech stuff .
and you ' re from the future too ?
i don ' t think so .
ah , but if i must . <continued_utterance> i have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the dark side . it gives me infinitely greater power .
come on , <person> . come on , buddy . <person> . <continued_utterance> alright . we ' re going up .
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
i don ' t know . you introduce two jews in the desert and wait five thousand years . then , bingo , somebody else who can see trouble coming but can ' t do anything about it .
i don ' t understand .
nothing , i ' m fine .
why didn ' t you say good-bye ?
is it dead ?
terminated .
i ' l l see what i can do .
he can ' t know that it ' s you <person> . we do too much business together . you ' re gon na have to get someone else to hit him and there is no way it can relate to us . you understand ?
your eyes can deceive you . <person> ' t trust them . <continued_utterance> <person> out with your feelings . <continued_utterance> you see , you can do it .
i call it luck .
<person> ' t worry . you ' ll get used to it . and tips were good , right ? <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>

there appears to be a dampening field in operation . i can not scan beyond the bulkhead . <person> puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door .

i can ' t - i can ' t do it . he ' s my brother .
if you wanted a toothbrush , i wouldn ' t ask questions . i ' d just quote a price . a toothbrush , see , is a non-lethal sort of object .
<person> enough . a rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long . looks like a miniature pickaxe , with a small sharp pick on one end , and a blunt hammerhead on the other . it ' s for rocks .

<person> , that was my fault .
i shouldn ' t have listened to you , i should ' ve followed you right into the `` can '' the way he did .

he wasn ' t even wrong for you , like cosmically wrong , so don ' t beat up on yourself for wasting . however long it was .
i know .
i ' ve had second thoughts . intimacy is dangerous and shattering . but ultimately necessary .
but , <person> , i used to wait outside her house , . ring the bell and then when she ' d come to the window i ' d run away . just to get a glimpse of her .

if he ' s really the one , you can find out the rest of his plan .
he never took his eyes off his mother , even as he moved to sit beside nicole . he looked frightened .
why would he be frightened ?
she probably went home , lit some candles , put on some relaxing music , took a nice hot bath , and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator .
have you no shame ?
hi , <person> , busy week ?
i ' ve only got two . it ' s dead around here . <continued_utterance> well , i ' ve got this one guy , a tourist . he had a heart attack on a cable car .

words .
it ' s gorgeous , ad .
thanks . how was rehearsal ?
i move around so much , i ' ve never had a place of my own . official residences have no warmth . i feel good here . i feel at home .

oh , just . when i was a kid i was bored .
well , you must have been really bored .
you ' re really good with people .
how ' s mr . <person> ?

i want to stop taking those pills .
that ' s better , mrs . <person> . but mrs . <person> is in a dreadful hurry . <person> could take . let ' s see . ten to twelve weeks , if poor mr . <person> is to die from natural causes .
i have a wonderful idea ! i can take him out in the car and when i get to a lonely spot , knock him on the head with a hammer , pour gasoline over him and over the car and start the whole thing ablaze .
you don ' t think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with ?
yes . i mean , no . i mean , maybe he would find her , i mean you attractive . maybe he doesn ' t like to dance . maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don ' t dance either .
<person> . <person> . <person> .
his father ' s a shiite . we ' re checking him out .
. she ' s in my hands , right ? moist to the touch . it ' s at that moment i think i control her - she ' s mine . but it ' s a false illusion , like in `` backdraft . `` no man controls fire ! she ' s ready , i ' m ready , she ' s ready , i yell , `` one-fifty four , forty eight . ``
to reveal he ' s holding a football .
<person> .
<person> .

out of the question .
well , your girlfriend then . even better .
i don ' t have a girl-friend .
so , it ' s from the future , is that right ?
one possible future . four your point of view . i don ' t know the tech stuff .
come here .
hey . !
tomorrow i want to make a tri- elliptical jump . that ' s where you jump out over northern china , and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry .
captain . perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony .
oh . <person> . why the borders ? almost every painting has one . was he in prison or something ?
most people don ' t notice . this is from his prison series . he could see a mango grove through his cell window . he made some of the pigments himself . from flowers .
you ' re going to tell me secrets ? you ' re not what you appear to be ? you have no secrets . <person> told me what your kids have told him over the years .
what have the kids told him about us ?
<person> don ' t blame marriage -- this one ' s married -- and she ' s not growing a national forest . how do you even cross your legs ? let me make you a spa appointment -- any thicker and you won ' t be able to find it .
so what -- it ' s my fault ? ! i let the sex go out of our marriage ! i deserve what i got . thanks for understanding .
<person> , pretend we ' re fairies . i ' m a girl fairy and my name is . la-ru . lee . and you ' re a boy fairy and your name is <person> .
ok .
he asked me to ask you to call him . <continued_utterance> i know ! it ' s none of my business . but i felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you . i swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall -- his heart stopped .
<person> -- it ' s so much more complicated than you can imagine .
you re sort of . radiant . your eyes are shining . you ' re rea <number> ly different . <continued_utterance> you ' re . you ' re a nun .
we ' re in a convent ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve got to go .
. what do you mean ? i ' m in the ship .
what are you doing in the ship ? <person> ?
what stuff ?
smoke . <person> . i ' ve heard stuff about a death squad . a group a guys loyal to the hardline school . guys that ' ve had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks , suspending cops right and left , tying their hands . while outa the other side a their mouths these same people ' re squealing save us , save us , do something you fucking morons , crime is totally out of control .
wakes up , gulping air . <person> , startled:
what ' s wrong ?
it used to be the old mill .
what ' ve you got ?
<person> ' t you supposed to set an example for people ?
nope . i ' m just supposed to hold people ' s hands while they die . what ' d you say your problem was ?
<person> , soon . <person> , this is my buddy <person> . he ' s getting married next week .
my condolences .
i don ' t need brain surgery , i just had a weird thing happen , that ' s all . like a hypnosis hangover . one-time deal , don ' t worry about it .
well , if anything like this happens again , we should go talk to <person> .
did this place come furnished ? it doesn ' t look like <person> . <person> isn ' t it ? - so bourgeois . now he ' s poking at the hadrian bust .
you should watch that !
<person> ' t that be on record ?
it ought to be . unless it was very recent . i hate to say it , but it looks like the system you ' re searching for doesn ' t exist .
how come <person> and <person> are so weird looking ?
cuz , dummy they ' re canadian , just like <person> !
why not ?
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles .
a hundred bucks .
<person> !
he looks down on hunsecker , leans over the table . <continued_utterance> you ' re blind , mr . <person> . this is a crossroads for me . i won ' t get <person> . not for a life-time pass to the polo grounds . not if you serve me <person> on a plate .
<person> , i told you -
i see more than what you are . <continued_utterance> i see what you could be . <continued_utterance> the man who is <person> picard and <person> of <person> won ' t exterminate the population of an entire planet ! <continued_utterance> and what will he do with that life ? <continued_utterance> if i were to beam to your ship . let you complete your medical procedure , give you a full life . what would you do with the time ? <continued_utterance> you once asked me about your past . your history . when i was your age , i burned with ambition . i was very proud and my pride often hurt people . i made every wrong choice a young man can . but one thing saved me . i had a father who believed in me . who took the time to teach me a better way . you have the same father .
yes .
you got froggy on me a couple times . <continued_utterance> i thought that riff about the death squad was pretty good . i hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it .
so there never was a death squad .
perhaps not . perhaps we can all use . a little spandex .
<person> ? and maybe shorter habits , and women priests , and sleeping late ?
is that like <person> ' s ?
not a lot , sweetie . it ' s a country .
general . i ' m not in politics . you can have this back . i won ' t use it .
because you don ' t have the balls . did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude ? you serve your country . is there anything else ? hub would love to just . clock him . instead:
she ' s cracking , <person> .
you didn ' t say that about the food ?
<person> thinks i shouldn ' t have come here -
<person> me , <person> . i said namely you shouldn ' t go around wild , blaming people without justification .
i put a cigarette out in it .
did you reach the next girl yet ?
so could <person> .
then why the rat ?
what ?
it ' s private .
you ' d better . i ' m very angry .
i ' m pretty busy , as you can see .
dr . <person> , if you ' d please consider -
no , no , no . you were doing fine , you ' d been courteous and receptive to courtesy , you ' d established trust with the embarrassing truth about <person> , and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire . it won ' t do . it ' s stupid and boring .
now seriously , why do you care what i wear ?
just curious .
more ! trust me !
<person>s . jimmy pig starts chopping furiously .
piss all you want . you took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today .
eighty million dollars ? i swear to you .
god . i know where they should have a commune for you . they should have a commune for you at bellevue .
i ' m sorry , iris . i didn ' t mean that .
every young boy ' s fancy . i seem to remember it myself . <person> well . mr . <person> , are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise ?
give the word , admiral .
<person> to peddle .
just a couple of hours . it ' ll be fun --
do you know who it was you were trying to kill ?
the senator from naboo .
so we ' d be paying attention when he found <person> .
ya know what ? i ' m getting extremely tired of hearing that word . in fact , that ' s gon na be policy from now on . no zero .
ya want me to call da boss ? huh ? <continued_utterance> no , no , it ' s alright . i ' ll have a big coca-cola - without ice - and a large buttered popcorn , and . . some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls . and ju-jukes , a box . they last . <continued_utterance> we don ' t have ju-jukes . we don ' t have coca-cola . we only got <person> .
that ' s fine .
what telegram ?
' <person> birthday , dear <person> , love <person> . ' or words to that effect . that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying , ' <person> , <person> , you win . you ' re the number one man . have a swell party . '
that ' s because it was a challenge . you has control over you ' re situation . it was hard , but you rose to it .
<person> . i ' ll think about that . bye .
it doesn ' t matter . i think about you every day .
really ?
my palate ' s kind of shot , but from what i can tell , i ' d dub it pretty damn good .
can i ask you a personal question ?
no . i say knock-knock ! you say who ' s there . i say who ' s there and then you say who who . you ' re not playing right . knock-knock .
who ' s there ?
what time .
nine .
absolutely , <person> . <person> , i had everything under control until you led us down here . you know , it ' s not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us .
it could be worse .
possibly .
then you must know <person> sido- dryas ?
it ' s in your play .
you like my play .
oh , <person> , my uncle . how am i ever going to explain this ?
learn about the force , luke .
so what ' s the difference ?
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back . <person> , you can ' t do anything to make her want to come back . you can only do things to make her not want to come back .
we ' ve got until her monday morning class , and then it ' s meet the press ; and `` where is she . ? '' who ' s got the professor . ? where is he . ?
<person> ' s <person> .
how much you going to pay us ?
ten k .
<person> !
<person> , i ' ll be back by midnight i ' m sure --
can it work ?
it can . ordinary matter , like ours ? not affected . everything else , disintegrates . <continued_utterance> what i ' m saying is : <person> ' t trust anyone . find yourself a weapon of some sort .
why didn ' t you call ?
i couldn ' t . do you know how hard it ' s been not to call you ? i pick up the phone every night . whenever that commercial comes on .
what kind of things ?
you know , us .
i don ' t know <person> , i ' m not his mother . but i am seeing him later .
when ?
do you miss him ?
every day . you know , it ' s weird -- i haven ' t cried very much at all . maybe you ' re only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and i used mine up .
smoke ? <continued_utterance> she wants to become a doctor . she ' s a bright kid . <person> worker . i think she ' ll make it . but the damned inflation ' s driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours . <continued_utterance> i got two other kids . i don ' t know what we ' ll do when they get old enough for college . <continued_utterance> everybody blames it on the oil crisis . that might be where it starts . but i think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off . i see it every day in the kitchen . peaches . we use the gallon cans . the price has gone up three times in the last year . and now the cans are only half full . <continued_utterance> do you have children ?
no .
i ain ' t going in the front .
i don ' t think it ' s a good idea you going in at all .
hey fella ! relax ! this whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out . <person> ' s make love .
do you remember when you first got here ? we used to talk all night long . until the sun came up . we would just lie in bed and talk .
anyway i ' ve got to the bottom of the delay . finally . we ' re waiting for someone from rome .
what do you mean ? they ' re sending someone from rome ?
<person> ' t give me any shit , kid . i taught you everything you know . <continued_utterance> i ' m damn proud of you , kid . your father would be , too .
thanks . i owe it all to you .
<person> girl . <continued_utterance> and what do you do wh .
i call him a fartface or a pervert , or something equally lame .
so who ' s giving the orders ? how do they coordinate , pick their targets ?
believe me , we ' ve put every resource we ' ve got onto that very question . otherwise . we wait .
what ?
that song by <person> , where it ' s said <person> a pusher , party truth , partly ficition , a walking contradiction .
no .
<person> . hello . how are you this morning ?
i got it .
come , <person> .
you use needles ?
no .
i hate to see you like this --
yes , but as a new subscriber you ' re under no obligation to take more than three books . and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
<person> closely . that isn ' t writing . those are grooves . <continued_utterance> no . they don ' t represent a message . they aren ' t decorative at all . they have another purpose entirely .
what ?
you put those - things in there . paid for it in advance , ten years ago . why , dr . <person> ? <continued_utterance> thank you .
your bleeding has stopped .
<person> .
no ! pretend you ' re fibbing ! remember ? <continued_utterance> now i have to die . <continued_utterance> pretend you say you don ' t want me to die .
right lets get outta here . <continued_utterance> where ' s the car <person> ?
i t ' s coming now .
i ' ll get you a cab .
<person> away from me .
me too .
i would love to see you again sometime .
then why you doin ' it ?
seems worthwhile , doesn ' t it ? maybe it ' s just for the cave-in on lonnegan ' s face when we put in the sting .
girls , this is <person> <person> . she ' ll be minding you until <person> ' s return . <person> , please assign a biblical passage . do not attempt discussion . am i understood ?
i got it .
it ' s not the scrub sink . i need your help . i ' m competing in the employee olympics . with your advanced surfing experience , <person> thought you might be able to help me .
everybody wants to be the surfer king . what advanced surfing experience ?
it ' s the genesis wave !
what ?
i was thinking <person> . get some butts in those seats .
and what next ? popcorn ? <person> calls ? this is not a theater . or a casino .
i ' m serious , mate , you need to get away from this shit , come and live with me for a bit . <continued_utterance> i ' m serious , mate . why not ? <continued_utterance> you ' d love <person> , man , it ' s full of fitness .
i can ' t just fuck off .
what are you talking about ? i take responsibility for anything within a block . you have nothing to worry about . that ' s my job .
excellent . so you ' re going to figure out what we do , right ?
your name , please .
<person> .
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch .
i ' ll take it .
did <person> attend the interview unaccompanied ?
yes , <person> .
you ' re not certified ?
not yet . probably by the end of the month .
i ' ll have a dewars on the rocks . <continued_utterance> thanks .
i ' ve seen you somewhere . where have i seen you ?
i am speaking for the president .
as far as the president is concerned . no , we do not .
no .
<person> . eat . i prepare food . i work as a cook . that ' s how i make money .
there ' s a vision . i keep having it . it ' s very powerful . and you ' re in it . and there ' s a bicycle . and this . old stone wall . and it ' s very peaceful . does this sound familiar ? like where you live , maybe ?
stone walls ? my parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an american eagle over the door . the only bike is a harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning .
j . j . , you said you want to help me - prove it !
how ?
your name ?
<person> . <person> .
quietly , <person> . <continued_utterance> tron . ?
he ' s dead .
i have a shortcut . can you get any of his school transcripts ?
sure . it ' s all on-line .
whatever . we ' ll see . <person> ' s gon na get her to bring a friend . we ' ll both get one . i don ' t care if i ' m with her or one of her beautiful baby friends .
i don ' t know .
i knew there was something wrong with them .
they ' re dead . they ' re finished . there was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world . but that wasn ' t good enough . oh , nol they wanted the ears of the world , too . so they opened their big mouths , and out came talk , talk , talk .
i often take something snacky down to <person> at this time of day . i know how the brain needs feeding .
<person> . the last writer ' s retreat i stayed at kind of froze my balls off , you know ?
she was lying there , in labor with <person> , when she sees something going on in the next bed . <continued_utterance> turns out it ' s <person> ' dad , uh , taking a nurse ' s temp . stay with me , i ' m trying to be delicate .
in silhouette , a man is fucking a nurse .
a cigarette ?
an extra heel of bread . please take it , you need your strength . you ' ve been working so hard .
anything ?
anything .
. it ' s an odd knife .
yeah . i got it from a russian fellow .
we can keep it in the bathroom . <continued_utterance> it ' s not real , <person> . some secretary wrote that up . <person> ' t tell me you thought it was real ? <continued_utterance> what ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t do the quiet thing . you know i hate it .
this is an important night for us . finally someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made . that you have put everything second , including me , for those families they ' re talking about . <continued_utterance> they ' re also saying that my husband has a gift . not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence . or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas . your gift teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would piss on themselves . yes , i believe what they wrote about you .
how ' bout a handkerchief ?
here .
yes i have , and do i look like a happy man ? was all that drama with <person> a happy thing for me to do ? huh ? was it ? is she a part of my life now ?
this is totally different . i ' m talking about avoiding what you ' re talking about . that ' s the distinction . i have not made the commitment yet . i am not married . i have not said the words . in a few days , i might get married , and if i do , then i won ' t be doing stuff like this anymore . <person> , what ' s the whole point of getting married ?
it ' s burning .
get out of there !
but it ' s the only proof we have to the future . about the war and all that .
i don ' t trust it ! these things are hard to kill , <person> , believe me , i know . we may never have this opportunity again .
what do you want ?
i don ' t know .
thanks .
bag some z ' s ?
sex . of course .
well , not exactly s .
i ' m sorry , <person> .
<person> , i . everybody ' s lost someone by now . this shouldn ' t be any different . <continued_utterance> no , i . oh , zander , i ' m a fool .
i will visit you .
and when you do , you ' ll wear your best clothes and knock em dead ?
and one like this . and one looking real sincere . <continued_utterance> what are you doing here ?
i ' m looking for <person> .
i didn ' t say i was going to clean <person> ' s toilet . he did .
but you thought it .
and you know what else ?
what ?
yes , i do .
would you translate for me ?
very well . we ' re ready for that information .
you ' ll have to send me back . i didn ' t get a good look at it . but i will next time .
in my classroom , you bet . whether it ' s exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . the people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it .
my mother always says that violence never solves anything .
i suppose i got really into wine originally through my ex-husband . he had a big , kind of show-off cellar . but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate , and the more i drank , the more i liked what it made me think about .
<person> ? <person> what ?
she ' s willing to fly anywhere .
she looks like my third grade teacher . i hated my third grade teacher . hold it ! wait a minute ! she is my third grade teacher !

i never saw you .
thanks , kid . where are you goin ' now ?

maybe you ' ll just be independent .
no , no i said , `` mclovin '' .
mclovin ?
what does that mean ?
liquid metal .
wet suits are for wimps .
<person> , you ' re right . let me get mine .
well , she was trying to keep her skirt down , sort of , you know . but it was pretty obvious what she was doing . i mean , <person> , it was rush hour and the traffic ' s practically standing still .
what did you do ?
i know that , <person> . i , we all know .
everybody , they , they , they treat me like a .
who ' re them as say you are ?
harolday , for one . oh , i ain ' t belly- aching . reckon he ' s entitled to his opinion . but him and me never did see eye to eye .
yeh , i think so . i gave the kay- ducer a c-note . you find out the deck ?
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza . i got you one of each . he likes to cold deck low , <number> ' s or <number> ' s .

a tragic story , no doubt . how ' d you get up here ?
charm .
nope . never finished one yet . i hate these things .
you were reading my <person> .
there was a very old man who lived on the island . he used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass . they were magical .
everything here is magical .
<person> , have you ever done this before ?
<person> , please , i nearly have a master ' s degree in cognitive psy-
what the hell ?
oh no .
yes .
that ' s fantastic .
i didn ' t imagine it -
i ' m not saying you did .
but people don ' t know that , <person> , do they ? it would make a pretty story , wouldn ' t it -- the senator ' s daughter involved with a married man who ' s about to become a father . <continued_utterance> keep your voice down .
what happened ? did he run out on you ?
what if it attacks ?
fifty yards and closing .
you wan na drink ? <continued_utterance> what are you looking at ?

i don ' t know , <person> . perhaps it ' s because i feel attacked .
i ask you one simple question , and suddenly i ' m attacking you .
where are we going to sleep ?
the family room .
<person> was so damned ultimate . everyday life . there ' s no way to go ultimate . <continued_utterance> but if it all gets too much like just too fucking much . you can end your life at any moment .
that ' s ultimate .

starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record . we can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander . he fought seventeen major engagements in the war . all successful . beyond that , we know nothing .
well . it seems we ' re truly sailing into the unknown . <person> at it . anything you can give me would be appreciated . dismissed .
from another planet . oh , i almost forgot . they have green blood and pointed ears .
and you know all this . because <continued_utterance> you ' re an entertaining man , <person> . but you ' re also full of shit .

your cell is more than adequate .
<person> . so what do we do now ? ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?

i ' m sorry , <person> .

i ' m glad of that . <person> and i went to russia once to a film festival and he was truly amazed how much his presence meant -

for example , he ' s just come back from a fire and he . um . that ' s a fine house . you look at that , and you know , there ' s nice people that live there .
i live there .

a friend is a person that is good to you . someone you like to be with . someone you like to laugh with .
it ' s just like a lie detector . certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie , the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock . <continued_utterance> we are very excited to see the results of this test . <person> <number> , would you step out here , please ? <person> steps out wearing a hospital gown . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> here has been fitted with the new v-chip .
my head hurts .
two years ago you were begging me for the money . nobody would ' ve touched you .
you ' re making an eighty percent return . which is what you wanted .
you ' re like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts . no , you know what you are , you ' re like a great portrait over a fireplace . words have been invented to describe women like you .
such as ?
<person> , i love you .

beautiful view , isn ' t it ?
that ' s up to you field guys . h . q . wants you to break ' em in when you do the annual security sweep in january .

<person> . where ' s <person> ?
i ' m sorry , <person> . he ' s . he didn ' t make it .
obi-wan <person> ! what makes you think so ?

it was just words .
but good words . that ' s where ideas begin . maybe you should listen to them .
made for each other .
it ' s cute . it ' s like a little clue . <continued_utterance> so he can ' t write . big deal . i mean , verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy , and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble .
what ' s happening to us ?
it ' s all right .
nothing , if you work in a fill- ing station . and i ' m getting rather bored with that sport jacket , and those same baggy pants . <person> , what ' s a good men ' s shop in town ? the very best .
i don ' t need any clothes , and i certainly don ' t want you buy- ing them for --

i don ' t really think you need cheesy- poofs , tubby-
boys , we have to have a difficult discussion .
i hope so . they haven ' t posted anything .
a job ' s come up and i thought about you . not really a job , more of - an interesting errand . walk me to my car , starling . <continued_utterance> we ' re trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody , for a psychobehavioral profile . could be a big help in unsolved cases . most of them have been happy to talk to us . they have a compulsion to boast , these people . do you spook easily , starling ?
mil trescientos . fifteen dollars american . as she pays him , distant thunder rolls .

you want to know a secret ? . i was a paper champion . do you know what that means ?
well it ' s not exactly a relationship ; we just have an occasional thing . zoe doesn ' t want to be tied down and -
not zoe ! <person> . you should get in there . <person> the girl . then you get to live back in your ancestral home .
she ' s a predator .
we ' re being hailed .
orange . grapefruit . <person> . but fancy . they have entire stores filled with fancy pots of jam wrapped in cloth . english . or french .

that ' s my real name ! currently i ' m a singer . sort of .
<person> well .
<person> , sorry to interrupt , but maybe we have to . maybe we have to balance those things against his assistance to his jewish colleagues . <continued_utterance> this is a transcript of the proceedings at nuremberg . a swedish businessman , <person> , testified in cross- examination that he had several meetings with <person> . ' i first saw goering , ' <person> testified , ' embroiled in a stormy interview with <person> , the famous conductor of the berlin philharmonic , who was vainly seeking permission to keep his jewish concert master . <continued_utterance> <person> , pick one of these , any one , read it out loud .
' please remember that dr . <person> risked his life to help anyone who asked him . i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help . he never turned anyone away . after he heard me play . i am a violinist . he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden . he helped countless people in similar ways . '

i ' m fuckin ' sick of this shit , man ! seriously . why do you hate her ? is there even an actual reason ? because seriously , i ' m beginning you think you like her .
<person> no ! i hate her .
i ' m not sure i can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class . in this case math . and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you ' ve learned math -- so they make you go to summer school . it helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission .
what do you mean they failed ?
says me .
maybe i ' ll ask him .

hot dogs ?
i want to buy you a hot dog so bad , <person> . all the things you ' ve never seen and done . you ' re here , but wherever you go , and whatever you touch , you bring the war with you .

i ' m fine .
to be clear -- this is a ring with diamonds -- not a diamond ring , right ? in that case . i love it . it ' s my second favorite thing i ' ve ever found in there . <continued_utterance> now , my gift ' s a little bit more .
<person> -- i ' ve got to go to bed .
<person>s like money to me .
<person> ' t forget your friends .
that ' s the difference .
another necklace , huh ? can i help ?
hey ! rule number one - never take off the mask ! y ' hear me ! no matter what happens , never take off the mask !
<person> , kansas .
<person> ramirez . a bus boy , rafael , overhears as he passes by .
<person> , the ball player !
one-zero-four-nine-three-three- one . or d ' you mind if i just call you ' one ' ? <continued_utterance> you know what i say you are , <person> ? i say you ' re a piece of shit .
that bastard ! people by the lakeside:
it sucks .
so it ' s almost a retroactive decision . so i could , like , let ' s say , forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her .
well , my little friend , you ' ve got something jammed in here real good . were you on a cruiser or .
help me , obi-wan <person> . you ' re my only hope .
wait ! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent .
answer me only this : are you the author of the plays of <person> ?
not .
my feelings exactly . <continued_utterance> how many people do you think heard that thing last night ?
-- and ?
they told me to call state .
yeah , but , sorry , i still don ' t have a job for you .
that ' s okay . i already found one . i ' m actually just trying to make a coffee table , and i ' d like to buy some wood and supplies .
how would you know i ' ve got cancer !
and cigarettes . i smoke , too .
it was a body bag . a homeless person had frozen during the night .
was it that cold ?
why would i do you a favor ?
morning , <person> , who ' s your friend . ?
why wouldn ' t he want to go through the roadblock ? . what did you guys do ? . i won ' t tell anybody .
it ' s easier not to tell if you don ' t know .
that ' s easy . i ' ll explain that in a minute . this is your ticket . when you get on the bus here , the driver will take this part . you will ride to omaha . when you get to omaha , ask the driver . ' <person> , please . i do not speak english . ' the star man nods that he understands . <continued_utterance> say it .
' <person> , please . i do not speak english . '
well , you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here . in the ocean . <number> percent of the earth ' s surface is water , norman . that ' s first grade geography .
it never occurred to me .
because of your mother ?
i don ' t know why i keep dreaming about her now . i haven ' t seen her since i was little .
there ' s a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then .
<person> ' ll you see it . <continued_utterance> we had a flight of f <number> ' s play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour . then it shot straight up and disappeared .
two to one , take your port to our nine o ' clock and commence firing .
<person> , two . <person> to your nine and commence firing .
what ? !
minneapolis .
i ' m going through some things .
you want to tell me about it ?
i ' m sorry , honey , it ' s just that i ' m thiiis close . <continued_utterance> imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake , never gets tired , never shows up to work with a hangover . meet the pilot .
why did you marry me , <person> ? why did we have these two children ? you don ' t need us . your heart and your mind are in here . but it doesn ' t love you like we do .
i can ' t stay here .
<person> , please . <person> , i ' m serious . i won ' t make it .
so we can reminisce about how i smashed your nose ?
you didn ' t smash it .
our campus . right there . see those beams from <person> ' s lab . we ' re late . it ' s coming . the conjunction will happen in a few seconds .
stop the car . ! come with me .
<person> ! where is my play ? tell me you have it nearly done ! tell me you have it started . you have begun ?
doubt that the stars are fire , doubt that the sun doth move
what for ?
i want to gamble .
. maybe you don ' t think three years is enough for a person to change but . things are different now <person> . i ' m different .
would you and your wife prefer still or sparkling water ?
that ' s exactly what it is . a theory . that evidence supports . when the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won ' t need me . inspector .
<person> and reynaud are my stars . <person> smart , very persistent investigators . on the street ; they ' re magnificent .
tell me .
you were never second . ever . <continued_utterance> you sleep now , <person> . everything will be different in the morning .
what are they ?
to calm your anxiety .
i know .
like do anything , you know .
i tried when i was a kid , and i was horrible .
<person> , how old were you when you quit driving .
you ' ve got a fruit loop in your hair .
you say that like i don ' t know that .
oh , that ' s for <person> . so , <person> tells me you ' re a butcher . <person> ' s talk meat .
<person> , no one wants to talk shop . especially butcher shop .
<person> . you ' re hardly in a position to accuse me of lying .
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore - or starting to . tell me the rest now .
that ' s . you ' re just making that up .
see . he ' s good .
of course i know you . it ' s my father ' s park , i try get to know everyone .
i ' m <person> !
speed -- two hundred , seventy-five thousand kilometers per second .
there ' s no temporal shielding in here ! we ' re starting to pick up relativistic effects !
you don ' t feel any emotion about it one way or the other ?
no . i have to stay functional until my mission is complete . then it doesn ' t matter .
huge amounts .
are you collecting mad hats ?
you and <person> went to san remo , is that right ?
yes , sure , we did go to san remo . that was months ago .
do you want to come with me ? -- i ' m going to the flea market .
i don ' t know what that .
that ' s good . judges like adopted indian boys . tell me more about the ottos .
they ' re smart . <person> to college . they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago .
that was crazy ! ! ! <continued_utterance> ahh , damn .
stop ! !
what are ya gon na do , call the cops ?
i don ' t have to . you ' ll be bustin ' in on the chief of police just up the hall . snyder is stopped cold . he calls after her .
<person> , <person> , i never thought i ' d be so glad to see you . <continued_utterance> maybe the phones are working again by now . <continued_utterance> ' dear , <person> . i just can ' t handle the commitment . i ' m leaving you . ' <person> , ' <person> . ' <continued_utterance> what the hell is this ? i didn ' t write this ? <continued_utterance> what the fuck ? !
<person> . <person> did you marry <person> ? i warned you not to marry her , didn ' t i ? i warned all of them . but none of them listened to me . they all went ahead and married her . she ' s the pretty one . where ' s <person> ? what have you done with my sister , <person> ?
to warn him .
of what ?
it ' s all about the desk . if i find the desk , the writing will come . and it better `cause i ' m using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator .
i think it ' s so great that you are re-doing your entire apartment .
you did it on purpose , didn ' t you ?
what ?
i ' m serious . the summer i was nineteen , i was at jones beach , i swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg . there was no way i was gon na make it back . i was goin ' down , i was swallowing water and everything . <person> was a lifeguard . i don ' t know what he was doing out that far , he said he just had a feeling .
oh my god , did you have sex with him like , that night ?
. i always thought so .
. such a pleasant sound .
i didn ' t waste words , <person> , take my word . i says , `` look , <person> , i ' m not selling you a dozen eggs , i ' m selling you herbie temple '' , i says , so don ' t gim me your lip !
<person> , <person> !
<person> .

this piece of puke hired me to kill you , baby . do you believe that ? isn ' t that right , <person> ? you pinhead .
oh my god . i don ' t believe this is happening .
<person> cochrane . this is your moment .
my god . they ' re really from another world ?
i ' m sorry i kissed you on the beach . <continued_utterance> let ' s just forget about it . forget it happened .
<person> ' t be sorry . i ' m not sorry about it .

he was a bit proud as i recall .
that was fun last night .
<person> . <person> food . you ' ve got quite a wine collection . <person> impressive .
<person> said that in all likelihood there was no real danger , is that true ?
right . that ' s true .
why didn ' t you call the police ?
and have them say what you did -- `` mr . <person> , how did you get him to do it ? '' and <person> would say we ' d planned it together .
you don ' t want me .
<person> .
sugar ! <continued_utterance> show us your curve .
not bad . mind if i try something ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> . <person> looks back to the men . <continued_utterance> hey , kid , do you mind ? may i ?
no ! that ' s not it . come on . <person> - uh huh ! come on .
you ' re imagining things .
we have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy . i want proof , not leads !
the visuals indicate life readings .
it ought to be . unless it was very recent . i hate to say it , but it looks like the system you ' re searching for doesn ' t exist .
that ' s impossible . perhaps the archives are incomplete .
<person> ?
i ' m a libra too . that ' s why we get along so well .
how rude ! <continued_utterance> that sounds like an r <number> unit in there . i wonder if . <continued_utterance> <person> ? how interesting . oh , my .
who are you ?
will you stop pestering me !
but <person> , you haven ' t called me . my father ' s leaving for florida the end of this week --
did you give this money to my daughter ?
i made this little deal . with all the kids to .
you go on and play , now .
what can i do for you , sheriff , <person> ' s not home y .
<person> . you have no idea . just wait till we go to big muddy ' s .
big muddy ' s ?
<person> ? oh sure . i , uh . well , no , i don ' t have anything particular to say .
oh , <person> why don ' t you just take out a knife and kill me all together .
because of all the other fun shit i ' m off doing .
<person> . so why weren ' t you at <person> ' s party on saturday ?
i see him . there ' s a weapon by his hand . he ' s not moving .
can you get the drop ?
you know something ? you should ' ve written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than <person> . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic ' s taken over by <person> and his propaganda ministry but <person> is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?
have no idea what ordinary people thought .
thank you , sir .
lieutenant , are you wearing your hair differently ?
tell me the truth . did he kill freddie ?
i ' d swear he didn ' t . of course he didn ' t .
you don ' t have to make it , mister .
do you understand why i came here ?
like a sickness and its cure together .
yes , like rain and sun , like cold and heat . is your lady beautiful ? since i came to visit from the country , i have not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?
this is a mistake . i haven ' t done anything .
no . but you will . it ' s very important that you live .
right .
right .
<person> and classic . when i saw it i just thought : that is what i should marry big in .
well , who ' s it by ? the label ?
good idea . meantime , try to get a feel for <person> . her apartment , her friends . how he might ' ve stalked her . i ' m going to the other two clinics , <person> and ohio . <person> ' s the hardest part , starling . use your anger , don ' t let it keep you from thinking . just keep your eyes on catherine . we ' ve got less than <number> hours .
mr . <person> . can those cops down there handle dr . <person> ?
see what good hands i ' m in . did you meet my gorgeous assistants ?
not formally .
<person> , what ' s the matter ?
when did you start using again ?
<person> facts ? you can ' t print them all . <person> is balance . finding the facts folks need to know .
<person> . the letters .
your new number . area code : <number> --
<person> , <person> , <person> . <number> ? no , no . i ' m a <number> gal . always have been .
it ' s <person> who ' s the target now . you have to protect him . he ' s wide open .
i know !
we have to follow them back . repair whatever damage they ' ve done to that time-line .
<person> integrity down to thirty percent .
<person> . pleasure .
so , <person> , tell me , have you questioned dr . <person> ?
i have your questionnaire here . it says you were never a member of the nazi party .
absolutely not . <continued_utterance> no , i was never a nazi , i have no interest in politics , i ' m a musician -
that ' s all going to change , <person> .
how ?
there appears to be a dampening field in operation . i can not scan beyond the bulkhead . <person> puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door .
i don ' t see a control panel . or an access port .
maybe you should use your <person> intuition .
it doesn ' t work around you . my mind is always a muddle . i can only think of you .
that sounds right . i ' m going .
you gon na get yourself killed for this ? this toxic-waste bitch !
it doesn ' t make sense . these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless .
if <person> was completed , it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground .
but that doesn ' t add , does it .
no it doesn ' t .
what do you remember about the accident ?
i remember the bus swerved , it just suddenly swerved to the right , and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road , and then it went over the embankment there , and everyone was screaming and everything . and that ' s all . i guess i was unconscious after that . that ' s all . then i was in the hospital .
where do you get your weed from ?
it aint . it aint mine , my erm , my mate left it , he left it here . i could phone him if you want , he ' ll sort you out .
<person> , take some executive . bored with his life , bored with his wife . he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar . then he goes around for months , torn up worrying that he ' s got aids , that he ' ll infect his wife . and maybe he really does catch something --
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig .
this is my daddy ' s house --
this is my house too !
i looked away for one second .
how would you describe him ?
i made this little deal . with all the kids to .
please . <continued_utterance> you don ' t tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones . what is the word for this .
neither did you !
i figured if you were gon na , then i wouldn ' t have to .
bloody terrible . <person> ' t move till well past chiswick . but look , i nipped into fortnums .
all my favourite teas - oh ! <continued_utterance> my goodness . you feel like my buzzy toothbrush just after i ' ve charged it up . you should go up to london more often .
how did <person> react to that ?
he was so confused by what i was doing , i don ' t think he even noticed . any word from the enterprise ?
her tits ! her tits ! how , that she signed in her contract , we hired her ' cause of ten years at the actors studio ? the way she played <person> ? her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first wife .
you have no right to .
how many times have i done this ?
does it matter ?
four months .
you have to commit . you have to actually give it a shot .
um , yeah . for a while now .
what are you doing in new york ?
you cunt .
fuck you .
regardless of how i may feel about <person> . our fates lie along different paths . nothing can change that .
you want some advice ? <person> ' t do this again . you know exactly what i mean .
you ' ll be up to your armpits in meatballs , i ' m flying them in from sweden .
is that like <person> ' s ?
you ' d be surprised .
i ' d like to hear . name me something bad you ' ve done in your life .
hi , i ' m your new neighbor .
<person> .
i can ' t believe the captain went along with a memory download .
<person> agrees that the b- <number> was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself . if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix , he should have all my abilities .
but not a big miracle like <person> .
oh , <person> was the big miracle for a long time . but i think i ' d like to try life without any miracles for a while .
<person> up !
cows have only been domesticated in the last eight thousand years , before that they were running around mad as lorries . the human digestive system ' `` ' hasn ' t got used to any dairy products yet , it takes a lot longer than that .
excuse me . i ' m late .
ah , funny running into you again . i noticed there ' s going to be a woody allen festival and i thought maybe we .
<person> , i ' ll be back by midnight i ' m sure --
whenever .
he ' s a remote operator . and remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field .
he seems pretty devoted to the mission .
ok is very close to ko , and ko is close to r . i fucking . p . you know what rip stands for <person> ?
it stands for .
i don ' t know , what ' s up ?
f . b . i . the captain ' d like a few words with ya . <person> got a couple minutes ?
hell yes . he does this every year .
<person> , finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can . i don ' t wanta be here all night .
no you didn ' t . you took the car .
all right , i drove to the beach . norma , you don ' t want me to feel i ' m locked up in this house ?
something about tampering . some body ' s prob ' ly trying to siphon the randd budget into his checking account , i don ' t know .
<person> had <person> <number> access .
i hope you ' re still alive , <person> .
i am .
i ' m absolutely positive .
no matter what i ' m asked , i ' ll tell the truth .
then let ' s each get our bearings .
i don ' t want my bearings . i ' ve had my bearings my whole fucking life . i felt something with you that . oh , you don ' t want to-
<person> .
<person> .
i can only write on a manual .
i know the feeling .
hearing test . first sequence . <person> ear . <continued_utterance> hearing test . first sequence . <person> ear .
<person> , i know you can hear me . did you find the bomber ?
oh shit .
mate , are you alright ?
maybe because you have a beautiful body . maybe that makes it easier .
i suppose it might . do you want to fuck ?
and you ' re just stupid enough to think that ' s an insult .
if a mistake ' s been made we ' ll fix it .
oh , no ! we ' ve got to do something .
what are you talking about ?
you all ready ?
will this take long ?
with my thing . will you be mingling ?
sure . if you feel safer .
because i have to .
well i don ' t .
what ?
the wedding . you and <person> . it was in the papers .
dunno mate , you ' re guess is as good as mine .
perhaps you should phone him up now , here , in front of me , tell him it ' s all bollocks .
do i have to get out ?
no , <person> . stay . i think you are a wonderful boy . be good . like you are . there are no monsters .
later , listen , i ' ll -
i ' ll listen now . after your father ' s murder , you were orphaned . you were ten years old . you went to live with cousins , on a sheep and horse ranch in montana . and - ?
probably . in my case it ' s probably a whole building .
then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key , say
we have received new orders . <person> our arrival at regula i , all materials of project <person> will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at ceti alpha vi .
the order comes from starfleet command , dr . <person> , direct from the general staff . <continued_utterance> but <person> is a civilian project , under my control --
no . that wasn ' t the plan ! we had a plan ! i can ' t believe you did that without even consulting me about it !
i don ' t really even understand what your plan is .
you don ' t want to know .
oh , i do want to know . i tried to reach you at the precinct .
no . you get more if you keep at it .
you ' re doing fantastic .
come midnight , how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on <person> ' s head ?
you think this is all very funny .
we ' re going to have some fun . remember fun ? we ' re going to have some of it . <person> ?
what exactly are we going to do ?
who is this woman ?
my sister .
what do you want ?
looks like you stirred things up around here last night , stranger .
what do you care anyway ? you don ' t even like <person> .
what ? of course i like <person> .
we ' ll take it . you manage the building at the end of the alley ?
for fifteen years .
<person> ' s do it .
they guys treatin ' you all right ?
what sort of thing ?
this sort of thing !
let me out , captain . open the door !
please , dr . <person> . <continued_utterance> sit down , dr . <person> ! you ' re in a military operation now -- <continued_utterance> . your civil rights have been overridden !
it ' s been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns . and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds .
not another lecture , <person> . not on the economics of politics . it ' s too early in the morning . and besides , you ' re generalising . the chancellor doesn ' t appear to be corrupt .
well what ?
i see you two all the time , you ' re thick as thieves , you are ! he must ' a said something !
where ' s <person> ?
i could call him . maybe he ' d join us .
now this is cosier . sort of like old times , isn ' t it , <person> ?
oh , skip it , <person> . it ' s pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband . especially when you ' re going to have another man ' s baby .
i bet . you ' ve traveled a long way , huh ? god must have something special in mind for you . <continued_utterance> what happened there ?
uh . when i boy . um . i don ' t know --
no , no i met her when i was on <person> .
you put her in your book !
what were you doing in here ?
cleaning up . come on . i ' ll get your computer . where ' s <person> parked ? he picks up the computer and turns to her , but she ' s already looking around the apartment .
<person> .
<person> , what ' s it like when you go through time ?

i feel like a princess . <continued_utterance> is this mine ?
it ' s the chance to escape , isn ' t it ? walk into another life .
you have another life . a rich one .
i just heard the death of the salesman .
in more ways than one .
<person> ' ll you see it . <continued_utterance> we had a flight of f <number> ' s play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour . then it shot straight up and disappeared .

i got some ideas . i was thinking maybe we could -- norah shakes her head .
i ' ve got my own ideas .
it ' s unbelievable .

<person> . <continued_utterance> <person> . <continued_utterance> i appreciate your stickin ' your neck out . i wouldn ' t have asked ya if it weren ' t for <person> .
why so ?
not him . her .
but you ' re still tormented , you must be , you ' ve killed somebody .
<person> ' t you put the past in a room , in the cellar , and lock the door and just never go in there ? because that ' s what i do .
and bringing the enterprise here ? ! what possible purpose could that serve ? !
i have a purpose .
a thousand feet .
a thousand ? an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- i don ' t want to sound pessimistic here , but i assume there are no survivors .
remarried . there is no move .

we can ' t all be perfect , saavik . you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land . around you are humans , and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence . you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you . <person> is logical .
yeah . sure . here . go nuts .
<person> . the cops !
you ' re a part of the <person> alliance . and a traitor . take her away !

<person> lady , we can ' t overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps . but i forbid you to drag it into the living room !
let ' s not fool ourselves . the police will say <person> wanted <person> out of the way so he could marry <person> . in a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband , and <person> had every motive .

i forgot to pay . i didn ' t want to be away from you for any longer .
<person> he ' s a sweet , kind and loving person . we like each other , but i don ' t want to think any further . it ' s taken me a long time to get back to dating , and i want to take things real steady this time .

we found two dead romulans aboard the station . we ' re analyzing their equipment to see if we can determine what ship they came from .

<person> ' s not a real transsexual , but he thinks he is . he tries to be . he ' s tried to be a lot of things , i expect .
you said - i was very close to the way we ' d catch him .
<person> ?
and you know what else ?
that doesn ' t interest me , <person> . and it ' s the sort of thing <person> would ask .
not anymore . surely the odd confluence of events hasn ' t escaped you , <person> . <person> dangles you before me . then i give you a bit of help . do you think it ' s because i like to look at you , and imagine how good you would taste . ?
<person> and politics , yeah , art and politics . <person> ' s look at that . you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich , played in countries the nazis had conquered . are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from <number> on wasn ' t a commercial for <person> and all he stood for ?
we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor .
who the fuck is that ?
chill out , he ' s an old mate of mine .
your west virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble , but i finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin .

it ' s a mess , right now . that ' s my project when i get back . <continued_utterance> see , i ' m not going to houston , after all . <continued_utterance> there ' s this clinic in montreal . we ' ve studied their process , we like their success rate . <continued_utterance> they combine some compounds that have been getting results in france , with vitamin injections . seems to activate the chemo .
you can ' t quit even if you want to and you know why .
no .
it ' s alright once i ' ve had my porridge , my haggis and a few <person> whiskies- and the monsoon ' s nearly over , so-
- and what monsoon would that be ? i ' d like to speak to your supervisor , son .
nothing , really . just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition . no big deal .
has it ever happened ?
oh , <person> , her lips ! the early morning rose would wither on the branch , if it could feel envy !
and her voice ? like lark song ?
at the big apple circus , it ' s the only big top i know . i said i ' d get ' em back tonight .
<person>,
when ?
two weeks , three at the most , <person> ! for pity ' s sake .
how do you think i realized i love you ?
i made you write a beautiful song .
he doesn ' t love her . he ' s just on the rebound from losing fran ; numbing his pain with loads of empty , rampant sex . what he really needs .
is a fifteen year old from ewedown .
<person> , <person> , we got ta get out now , come on . that ' s it .
we don ' t have much time .
tell your mother i ' ll pay for this .
it ' s okay .
i like to bleed , sir .
it doesn ' t . hurt ?
why ? <continued_utterance> you can ' t do it alone , ya know . it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make ' em look good .
we ' ll get by without ' em .
she does ? i mean , fine , it ' s none of my business . but .
she knows i ' m not monogamous . we ' ve discussed it .
what month ?
december twenty-first .
it ' s worse . he ' s overly critical . he never listens ! he just doesn ' t understand ! it ' s not fair !
i ' m sorry . you sounded exactly like that little boy i once knew , when he didn ' t get his way .
for what ?
for being on to <person> .
same way i found <person> , and speck , and <person> . and you . that rang a bell . <continued_utterance> i need someplace quiet - someplace i can concentrate . and your assurance that once he ' s located , we go get him together .
i can ' t do that .
we have to leave the city , immediately . and avoid the authorities .
can i stop by my house ?
luck is not a factor . no one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren ' t . federal studies like this might provide a clue . the next card up is the nine of clubs .
i wouldn ' t want to know what everyone was thinking . four of spades .
governor <person> , i should have expected to find you holding <person> ' s leash . i recognized your foul stench when i was brought on board .
charming to the last . you don ' t know how hard i found it signing the order to terminate your life !
you turkish ?
yup . -
not significant .
you take a team , and <person> .
you don ' t have to be a genius .
i knew it was <person> .
find it .
if you do the product placement .
all right , boys , keep tight now .
<person> , i have no approach vector . i ' m not set .
yeah , or `` later , dickwad . `` or if someone gets upset you say `` chill out . `` like that . or you can do combinations .
<person> out , dickwad .
they call you <person> , right ?
and they call you <person> .
we ' re great .
well , you should be careful boys . that ' s how accidents happen .
i ' m not inquiring where mr .
why don ' t you ? i ' m writing a script and i ' m dying to finish it , no matter what .
for the life of me , sir , i can not <continued_utterance> actually , she said you had decided .
<person> said right off , i was under suspicion . i didn ' t have a lawyer .
<person> ' t be too proud of this technological terror you ' ve constructed . the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force .
<person> ' t try to frighten us with your sorcerer ' s ways , <person> . your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes , or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel ' s hidden fort .
you look like a rent boy .
what are you talking about ?
s ' pose you let me see that bill of sale .
it ' s right out here .
what museum ?
i ' m sorry . <person> ? not . i said orchestra . <person> . believe me . help me , <person> . you say you answer for someone from high up . i , too , have orders from high up . <person> high up . we want <person> . i ' ll give you in return the whole orchestra , four , five conductors . i need him , <person> .
trix .
me too ! will it ever end ? ! i love this lady !
i cut your new orders personally . by the end of the month , you ' ll have your first command : uss excelsior .
thank you , sir . i ' ve looked forward to this for a long time .
just people people , you know . just people . had a dead man once .
really ?
they keep you busy .
yeah .
he only remembers i
uh . you hate my guts ?
is in the living room , waiting for him .
opens the door . he can not speak .
i like this .
what ?
i don ' t feel anything between you . <person> , your trouble is you assume too much , <person> . you assume there ' s something where there ' s nothing . you assume you have a life . but you ' re only hustling pieces of other lives on tape , and broken parts of your own .
we have nothing to talk about , <person> .
indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing .
but everything that ' s happening is good ! you can be a part of it !
<person> . <continued_utterance> i thought it was <continued_utterance> for what ?
just a babysitter -- i mean . you ' re working .
-- so , when the land came up , i snatched it and the house was built in record time and . it ' s like a thousand degrees in here .
you know , they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing , that we have a need to take care of someone .
<person> said that the true jury of a person ' s peers is the people of her town . only they , the people who have known her all her life , and not twelve strangers , can decide her guilt or innocence . and if i have committed a crime , then it ' s a crime against them , so they are the ones who must decide my punishment .
that ' s what he said , is it ?
i don ' t see anything .
<person> harder .
wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
what are you talking about ?
that i am not <person> . that <person> died . <person> herself . i ' m different .
that you ' re better at everything than i am . and i was thanking god for there being this one thing where i might have my nose in front .
and that thing is ? ? ?
<person> ? why waste our best people on a small-time job like this ? it ain ' t no heavy gee we ' re after .
then why ain ' t he dead ?
make every shot count ! <continued_utterance> sergeant , secure the boat !
yes , sir !
you don ' t drink ? but . but , you told me to get the liquor !
yeah , i ' m . uh . throwin ' a party , remember ?
<person> ?
hey seth , your partner didn ' t come again ?
everything ok ?
that ' s what we gon na ask you . what you plan tonight ?
how ' d you play tonight ?
good , good .
<person> ' t you want to make it ? can ' t you make it ?
i want to help you .
oh boy . here we go .
what now ?
why do you take this apart now ? i ' m trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these .
excuse me , sir .
you wouldn ' t be lying to us would you now ?
why should we ? could just have disappeared .
say hi to zoe .
i will .
who can say . ? best thing for him , really . his therapy was going nowhere .
<person> ' t it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ?
oh , yeah . <person> will do anything in front of a taxi driver . i mean anything . <person> too cheap to rent a hotel room , people scoring dope , people shooting up , people who want to embarrass you . it ' s like you ' re not even there , not even a person . nobody knows you .
com ' on , travis . it ' s not that bad .
she , uh . she had lunch with her father .
<person> with her father - you seconded to that detail ?
<person> , <person> has all those great titles the students give courses .
the holocaust and <person> ?
i have submitted my resignation to <person> ' <person> . privately . i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible .
but -- why ?
<person> ' t be sorry . i ' m not sorry about it .
me neither .
i sign these applications as a matter of course , hundreds of them . everyone wants to come to the land of opportunity and baywatch .
you spent two years in israeli jails during the intifada .
he was quite happy not to talk about the past .
i did a sketch of him .
no , i guess not . they ' re pretty anal around here . <person> ' t tell them you saw me smoking in here , okay ?
you ' re the inventor of this thing .
i like them . i ' ve always liked them . i ' m just a turtleneck kinda gal .
you ever get hot ?
there ' s word he ' s gon na run a con on the north side here . we got a year-old florida warrant on him , but it ' s a thin beef , and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold . all we want you to do is pick up <person> for us .
why don ' t you pick him up yourself ?
into the backstretch it ' s war <person> still by a length , <person> closing on the inside , is second by two , <person> is third by one and a half , followed by <person> , <person> , <person> ' end and <person> .
you ' re doin ' great , <person> . he loves ya .
i prefer there not be a scar .
that fellow is annoying . he ' s in here every week . <person> clockwork . <continued_utterance> there . i think that should --
will he delay the start of the campaign ?
. his grief .
i know it ' s a long shot , but if i don ' t find them i ' ll do what i can on my own . it ' s what we always talked about . <person> , i ' m not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service . the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side -- the side i believe in .
and i ' m stuck here .
are you hungry ? you could make us something ? <continued_utterance> it ' s two solid months , around the clock , <person> needs some cover- age , you ' re in a trial , what are we talking about ? there ' ll be other assignments .
they ' re my kids .
me too .
but so far the kissing is spectacular . i ' m not grading you , just mentioning it . brilliant .
put something in his room . what does he like ?
<number> -year old girls .
what else . ? let ' s see . you have complete freedom .
to do what ?
that i am not <person> . that <person> died . <person> herself . i ' m different .
who have you been talking to ?
so , he bought it -- and you ' re going to live there with him ?
yes , together . that ' s right .
<person> ? about last night ?
it ' s never happening again .
i don ' t think dr . <person> sent me a telegram . i was simply told . in a letter , i believe . i don ' t remember exactly .
<person> and goering were sure heaping honours on you . one makes you a privy councillor , the other makes you vice-president of the chamber of music , and you weren ' t even a member of the party , how do you explain that ?
it is all bizarrely plausible .
because i am a slum dog , chi- wallah , i am a liar , right ?
i screwed it up twice before .
here ' s the thing . this is me that you ' re marrying tomorrow . me .
you trace it yet ?
all we know right now is that it ' s east of here .
well , i ' m certain something can be worked out . run along , young man . peter begins to leave . <continued_utterance> just a minute . how about if i show you my discoveries . something i never showed to any other student . as a matter of fact to anybody at all .
well i am really flattered , i mean i ' d love to . but i .
well , uh , i mean , i ' m just .
i ' ll take that as a ' yes ' .
<person> died last night because the asshole we ' re after isn ' t in custody . it ' s happened to me before and i ' m sure it will happen again . it ' s a pretty miserable feeling .
i haven ' t felt it in a long time . <person> ?
<person> . got it . <person> , the way i see it , i ' m stuck here , right ? i mean , i ' m here or i ' m target practice . so here ' s the deal -- i don ' t bug you , you don ' t bug me . i ' ll catch up on some sleep , watch some tube , lay back and lay low . so just get me a key and show me to my room , and do not disturb . <person> ?
of course . but it ' s almost lunch .
<person> ' t that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals ?
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote .
salivating . <continued_utterance> i have to concentrate . <continued_utterance> biofeedback training .
huh .
it ' s one of the great , great pleasures meeting you .
it ' s <person> on the coast .
so do i . <person> , there ' s nothing more i ' d like to do than have , kids , or .
it ' s just , i get scared that certain things will happen , or .
we gon na sign him ?
<person> . <person> . we want to play it low- key , see what his agent says .
you ' re a . you ' re sick .
that ' s a matter of opinion .
it really worries me , <person> .
well , look , they have , doctors -- i assume -- that deal , only with , webbed feet . and , <person> , and i ' m talking strictly hypothetically , should that happen , we ' ll find one .
great god in heaven save me .
hi .
i ' m terribly sorry , mr . de <person> .
it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?
well , fine , fine . <person> da dee . and how ' s it working ?
like . clockwork .
why him ?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor .
why ? so you can fuck up our life some more ?
eric ! <person> ' t talk to ms . <person> that way !
now <person> , if you will take this man , through good times and bad , for ever and ever , as your husband , please say `` i do '' .
i do .
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health .
want one ?
great stars have great pride . <continued_utterance> go away . go to that girl of yours .
<person> , i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake . i didn ' t want to hurt you . you ' ve been good to me . you ' re the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me .
this is sort of high class .
i mean porno movies .
no , wait . they ' ll hear !
come here , you big coward ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! come here !
you ' ll end up like me .
you ' re not gibarian .
no gas .
i know .
why not ? good foremen don ' t grow on bushes .
is that your only motive for coming here ?
oh great ! he tried to kill me ! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you .
did you - kill him ?
the apothecary ? <person> , what is the story ? where is the shipwreck ? how does the comedy end ?
by <person> , i wish i knew .
did you get hands that car ?
i got him one like it .
we have rules of engagement we ' re gon na follow here , folks , so put the safeties back on your weapons . <person> ' s killing anybody until we see what ' s what . <continued_utterance> <person> , this is <person> of the fbi , i ' ll be negotiating our way out of this . let me talk to one of them . i know . i know . you just hang in there , <person> . no , don ' t worry , i ' ve got somebody here who can translate . <continued_utterance> <person> , -- my name is <person> . i don ' t have any authority to make deals , or respond to demands . i just want to find out if you need anything in there ? if any of the passengers are in need of medical attention ? <continued_utterance> -- <person> ?
i don ' t know if they understand .
and ?
i liked it a lot . a lot of improvements . it just seemed overall , i don ' t know , tighter , more . congealed or something .
what ?
you ' re far too trusting . <person> is too remote to make an effective demonstration . but don ' t worry . we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough .
that ' s cos he ' s peaceful . no worries , anymore . no troubles . <continued_utterance> pocket . <continued_utterance> i found this in jack ' s drawer at the paper . i don ' t know if it ' s somethin ' special .
oh , it ' s his lodge pin . we were lookin ' all over .
at <number> : <number> ? that ' s a bootie call .
no , it ' s not like that . he just got off work -- he ' s a waiter .
what a dirty trick .
it ' s just <person> ' s way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there . consider it a rookie initiation .
well , you must have been really bored .
i was .
how ' s your lip -- ?
so . you like to watch -- ?
i won ' t say anything .
i know . so , i ' m working for this puke , right ? and he says he ' ll pay me quite large to do the hooker . but also i got ta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she ' s totally out of control . <continued_utterance> only he doesn ' t know about me and <person> . so i say to myself , if i turn the job down , he just gets somebody else . and i lose <person> . to coin a phrase . so to buy time , i do the skank . i still got ta do something about <person> . i figure it ' s him or me . but i can ' t cap him without a chump to take the fall . and who better than his girlfriend ' s loser ex-boyfriend . a known criminal . who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times .
why not ?
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .
it was burnt .
mmm .
guess i took a wrong turn somewhere .
but -- if you ' re a user -- then everything you ' ve done has been part of a plan .
what happened ?
you were trying to break down the door . do you know why ?
i wish you could be me , so you could know how great it feels to be with you .
it sounds wonderful
yes , i did . i ' m aware it was a bold move , one of those impulses that grabs you , ' but . so far , we ' re okay ; right ?
well , uh , i mean , i ' m just .
that didn ' t happen , <person> .
i think <person> would do that , <person> .
there ' s not much there yet , but you can still find . . a little citrus . maybe some strawberry . passion fruit . and there ' s even a hint of like asparagus . or like a nutty edam cheese .
huh . maybe a little strawberry . <person> , strawberry . i ' m not so sure about the cheese .
what ?
<person> sucked big time .
<person> , i assume .
i ' m delighted to meet you at last . we have a great deal to discuss , senator . i hope you can keep your young jedi under control .
no , we can make it .
i ' m crazy . i ' m crazy . i ' m crazy .
oh my god . are you serious ?
i think so . what do you think ?
<person> not to look at the stars .
right .
turn the goddamn thing off , will ya .
you sober ?
<person> ' t it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ?
and have them clomping about in my life ? oh dear , no . at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own . how did you feel when you saw him , <person> ? may i call you <person> ?
i took out three hundred , but i ' m only gon na bet with one . i figure if we buy a lot of chips , the pit boss will see and they ' ll comp us all sorts of shit , then we trade back the chips at the end of the night . you got ta be cool though .
i ' m cool , baby . they ' re gon na give <person> a room , some breakfast , maybe <person> ' s singing .
you weren ' t a paper champion .
someone else can help you . someone else can make you happy . <person> is crying now .
<person> , sit down . <person> , make up a volcano . this boy in training .
what did i spill now ?
what would you think of me if -
nothing i didn ' t think of you before .
at ease , lieutenant . what if they fought ? a sudden silence .

in the bathroom . <person> , can you get them for us ? <person> nods and runs down the hall . <continued_utterance> who are you people ?

i love you . <person> sits with his arms crossed and a frown . <continued_utterance> you know i do .
i know .
i ' ll help pay for <person> , if that ' s what you ' re really talking about . i ' ll even give you the money i got for my kids . that ' s what we used to do , remember ? help each other . this was a community .
i ' m sorry .
is this one of zem ?
no ! that ' s not terrance or <person> !
<person> , <person> .
they ' ll never get there in time to save him . they have to come half way across the galaxy . <person> , <person> is less than a parsec away .
was looking at <person> like that ?
i don ' t know what you mean , major .
let ' s just say i ' m uncomfortable with the whole scenario .
oh jesus , <person> . <continued_utterance> and don ' t forget all the bad times you had with victoria . how small she make you feel . that ' s why you had the affair in the first place .
i ' m the best .
<person> . catch that <person> !
whoa ! way to go , boy-yo !
next time we meet , i ' ll probably have to salute you . what about you , son ?
what could i be ?
so much .
but , mr . -- er -- i don ' t know your name .
<person> , miss .
all aboard . doors are closing .
<person> ' t you understand ? i ' m in it , <person> . i ' m calling you from inside the mission . inside the source code .
it ' s very pretty , <person> . thank you .
you gon na play something ?
thank you , <person> .
we got the digits , baby .
<person> . they ' re way too small .
<person> , but when i was wearing your dad ' s pants last night i realized that if i buy pants that are too small it ' ll encourage me to lose weight . and in tight pants chicks ' ll kind of see my dick a little .
have to write you up then .
is this . ? <continued_utterance> wait a sec . i ' m a little out of it here . where ' s this train headed ?
<person> , i ' m really grateful . can i offer you some meat as payment ? please , help yourself to some meat .
i ' m trying to be a vegetarian .
<person> ! ooh la la , <person>cita !
hi , <person> !
no , i ' m pretty sure i ' ve seen them all and i saw the last one twice .
<person> , we ' ve got a walk in , may need stitches . . .
the big question is who killed him .
always is , sir . i can give you a rough profile ; white male , thirty to thirty-four . has some college but no degree . neat in appearance . at least six feet tall . <person> intelligent . charming when necessary . he uses murder as a tool , probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor . he ' s killed before and will again unless caught .
what the hell happened ?
they switched us over .
her boyfriend called her a slut . she went off to prove it . her and the professor . coked up , boat capsized . both bodies washed up naked . <person> dressed ' em up . full of ecstasy .
. he killed her .
i told them what you said about the script .
i didn ' t say anything special , i was just talking out loud .
yes . he ' s got something to tell me .
you think we can make it there ?
new york ? <continued_utterance> do you know where i got on ?
<person> .
i ' m afraid the situation demands that kind of risk .
i don ' t like it , <person> .
but . i ' m in love with you .
i ' m sorry . <person> looks as if he ' s just been punched .
what the hell are you doing ?
i don ' t know if i want to do this .
all the same -- what ?
take a slug . <continued_utterance> whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how much alike they are ? both fool you , but you never figger out how to do without ' em . <continued_utterance> take another .
yeah i just needed to splash my face , freshen up a bit .
have you slept ?
it ' d be fine .
i ' m sorry . i ' m very lonely . i don ' t know what ' s wrong . i just -- i ' m sorry . can you understand ? do you understand loneliness ?
now your testimony was interrupted yesterday , when that power line set fire to your mother-in-law ' s farmhouse . <continued_utterance> and her farmhouse . ?
the damage was considerable . but she ' s insured . thanks , again .
i ' m sick .
what ' s wrong ?
come on , a wuss like me ? the stiff who wouldn ' t help her own daughter fight back ?
maybe i was wrong on that one .
why , you got one of your feeling again ? <continued_utterance> is it bad ? <continued_utterance> if it does , i won ' t let anything bad happen to you .
i don ' t want you to die .
<person> system .
whew .

hey , hey , slow up , <person> has to take down what you say .
why are you being so defensive ?
i don ' t know , <person> . perhaps it ' s because i feel attacked .
no . <person> must have zem inside . we will have to dig .
that ' s gon na take a long time !
there ' s no mistake ? you ' re absolutely sure ?
i saw it with my own eyes . we ' ve killed an extraterrestrial and .
my ankle . just go explain the situation .
uh , excuse me , sir , but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago , and he seems to have left his wallet behind , and we were wondering .
my brother <person> . my mother ' s going back in the hospital again .
no , sh- he stops himself . she looks at him .
you should just tell people you ' re <person> .
i think your boyfriend is winning .
<person> was the most incorruptible sport . no megalomillionaires , no <continued_utterance> gambling . and it was a safe place for kids , a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome , clean fun .
sure , <person> .
where ' ll i find judge <person> ?
he rooms behind his office down the street . <person> ' t usually pull up the blinds till around noon , though .

of course i love him . i always will . i ' m just not in love with him any more .

no , i ' m alright . my scholarship covers almost everything , and i sell some photos here and there . today my physics professor asked for some of my work . he wants to study my data . they might publish my work in the science magazine .

it was just words .
you said it would be unethical to help me . you call dwarf bowling ethical !

<person> .
my lord .
i have spoken with your father .
but , mrs . <person> , you ' ve got to make him do something about this . <person> ' t you see that just one word from him would extricate guy from this dreadful situation ?
oh , but <person> , i ' m sure this thing must be some practical joke . you know , <person> sometimes goes too far . of course i shouldn ' t be saying this to an outsider , but sometimes he ' s terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades .

we ' re out of money .
i know , but she did . she ' s with someone else now .

wait . the <person> . why did it change course ?
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector . any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction . <person> is starting to get an idea . he ' s onto something here . he moves to a large table in the center of the room .

i ' m look at his whole history ! citations , letters of commendation , even his fucking test scores from quantico .
i don ' t believe it .
did you read the latest draft , by the way ?
oh , yeah . <person> .

why ?
press ? no , i haven ' t .
<person> . security ' s been our biggest worry . now that you ' re here we can shut this thing down tight .
i don ' t know . the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on . does that makes me some kind of fag ?
no , baby . you ' re money .

thank the maker ! this oil bath is going to feel so good . i ' ve got such a bad case of dust contamination , i can barely move !
it just isn ' t fair . oh , <person> is right . i ' m never gon na get out of here !
what ' s your worst memory of childhood ? quicker than that . i ' m not interested in your worst invention .
the death of my father .
and i think the reason i ' m not interested in other women . is ' cause i .
<person> . all this time right in front of us . how could i have been so blind ?
<person> and clear , kid . what ' s up ?
well , i finished my circle . i don ' t pick up any life readings .
an insolent penny-a-page rogue , <person> , he said , christopher <person> -- has he been to the house ?
<person> ? oh yes , he is the one , lovely waistcoat , shame about the poetry .
my face ! there was an argument . i said some things i shouldn ' t have . about you . about the appalling way he ' s treating you , all of us . and the next thing i know he ' s launched himself at me . are you getting on ?
what ?
i ' ll be there .
you bringing your new friend ?
this one ' s in a pretty bad way , mr . <person> .
<person> ' t you get that stuff off him ?
you stupid cow !
i ' m making something happen !
<person> turned up unexpectedly --
and you and mr . <person> knew the truth all the time ?
no , honey , i kissed you .
i know that one was me .
is she obedient ?
as any mule in christendom . but if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .
how are you holding up ?
oh , fine . . i ' m fine , i ' m .
<person> , calm down , okay ? just relax .
get the fuck out of my house .
what have the kids told him about us ?
i don ' t tell that . i save that for blackmail .
some champagne ?
fine , fine .
you watch him , <person> , i s . s . stutter !
<person> , i caught your act the other night and -
no . not mean . just . very angry .
oh .
wow .
what ?
how do you like that ? we ' ve made twelve pictures together .
maybe de<person> is shooting .
he ' s a white male . serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group . and he ' s not a drifter - he ' s got his own house , somewhere . not an apartment .
why ?
nothing . and everything . this is deeper than money . <person> up . <person> is done . <person> is over . understand that . you are over . just shut the fuck up .
<person> , please , <person> . <person> . be cool .
aw , i got a brother down in k . c . , runs a freight outlet . i can go halfsies with ' em ! it ain ' t too exciting , but it ' s mostly legal . <continued_utterance> straighten up , kid . i wouldn ' t turn ya out if ya weren ' t ready . i got a guy named <person> i want you to look up . there ain ' t a better insideman alive . he ' ll teach ya everything ya got ta know .

<person> , get this through your head . i ' m not just your agent . it ' s not the ten per cent . i ' m your friend .
come on , <person> -- hold me a minute .
i ' d love to . babe -- but i ' ve got to go . it was great . <person> usual .
obsessively .
huh .
when i ' m on my bike i feel like a wild person . better than any sex i ' ve ever had .
<person> tough on the butt .
he copped to what ?
hope she was worth it .
i don ' t care where you ' re from you just can ' t disappear into thin air .
<person> , listen to what you ' re saying . this thing ' s changed itself into a man . disappearing may not be that big a deal .
hey . he didn ' t look like no big time criminal to me . <continued_utterance> eh . the store tells you to call when there ' s trouble , so they won ' t get sued . but that shouldn ' t matter if there ' s a reward , right ?
i wouldn ' t think so .
not so , counsellor . that secretary of yours , she wasn ' t just your secretary , she procured women for you , didn ' t she ? as many and as often as you wanted .
stop this , please , stop this now !
i . i was just trying to make the world a better place for children .
yes . and in doing so , you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming .
unfortunately , not yet . but as soon as i do , i ' ll --
-- get back to me , yeah , i know . here ' s what i ' m gon na do . i ' m gon na have a couple my `` teammates '' here escort you back to wherever you came from . and then i ' m gon na go back to the office and wait for that official cooperation request . okay by you ?
i don ' t know which one of these guys told you that , but they were just trying to scare you , i think .
i don ' t like people looking at me like that .
is that your only motive for coming here ?
what other motive could i have ?
or . ?
they revoke our flight status .
i guess .
the landlady - as far as i could tell , the landlady said he was here right now .
i could probably see my bedroom from here . i can see my house . when you see where you live from a distance it ' s like a dream , isn ' t it ?
i don ' t care for b . s . i don ' t care to hear it . i don ' t care to speak it .
<person> ' yourself some friends , <person> .
i wouldn ' t say `` friends . `` i ' m a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning . that ' s a wonderful pet to have .
i have no enemies here .
no ? just wait . <continued_utterance> word gets around . the sisters have taken a real shine to you , yes they have . especially <person> .
that ' s okay . i already found one . i ' m actually just trying to make a coffee table , and i ' d like to buy some wood and supplies .
i don ' t really sell raw materials .
<person> says hi . <continued_utterance> she says she ' s sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant . she just likes it a lot .
what ?
so what are you up to today , <person> ?
just kickin ' back , i guess . i don ' t know . <person> and i were supposed to go golfing .
durn funny -- that storm quittin ' just about the time i get here .
no funnier than you sloggin ' through it , just to deliver a letter from a woman .
we ' re having a party for you , boy . <person> and shish-k-bob , just like you love .
you made me hurt him !
then let him talks to me . we don ' t need you to solve our prob .
. it ' s my problem , too . <continued_utterance> i got used to . thinking of them .
good . i think about things .
<person> ?
no .
a virgin brain ! well we ' re going to start you off right . so what do you know about this ? save us some time .
visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters . <person> second , <person> third .
what ' s the line on visitation ?
sure .
just point her at capri and avoid the rocks .
believe it . now bring me the trodes , baby . come on , quick .
what ' re you going to do ? <continued_utterance> you can ' t just . kill him .
<person> , listen to what you ' re saying . this thing ' s changed itself into a man . disappearing may not be that big a deal .
so far you ' ve let it cross the heart of america . for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security . i don ' t see the humor in that .
for a drive . i don ' t know when we last went out .
this is absolutely yummy .
what ' s plan b ?
<person> is your dad .
i knew you wouldn ' t have any fun here .
i am having fun . <continued_utterance> no thanks .
after the attack , a navy guy woke me up -- i don ' t know -- i thought he was an illusion . but i checked the tape , and <person> said he manifested him .
manifested ?
i ride around nights mostly . subways , buses . see things . <person> ' d i might as well get paid for it .
we don ' t need any misfits around here , son .
no way . no way .
<person> , <person> , please .
they work for the people we ' re trying to sue . their job is to try to minimize damages . our job , <person> , is to try to maximize them . you have to think of it that way . as people doing their jobs . no good guys or bad guys . just our side and their side .
i won ' t lie .
<person> or bottle ?
bottle .
he was going to kill us .
where did you get the gun ?
and don ' t forget . i have the key .
you have the key . tell me some good things about <person> . <person> ' t get up . just tell me some nice things .
yes . <person> toward the end .
why did she do it ?
the people you served thought you did a good job . i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office .
<person> rule is not democracy , <person> . it gives the people what they want , not what they need . and , truthfully , i was relieved when my two terms were up . so were my parents . they worried about me during the blockade and couldn ' t wait for it all to be over . actually , i was hoping to have a family by now . my sisters have the most amazing , wonderful kids . but when the <person> asked me to serve as senator , i couldn ' t refuse her .
pabst . you boys been doing a bit of drinking ?
no officer . not at all .
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
her name ' s <person> . we were friends . she disappeared last year . nobody knows where . she was a little wild , but not like that . <continued_utterance> anyway , i know you ' re gon na be in on the autopsies - of the girls they found over at speck ' s . figured you might see if one of ' em was . her voice trails off . this is hard . <continued_utterance> if it is , i ' d like to be the one to notify her folks . out families ' ve been friends for years .
sure . of course .
you see someone you like , you get a feeling about them , you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
-- a slice of pizza --
<person> . i had a great time .
me too .
what can i do for you , sheriff , <person> ' s not home y .
that ' s . <continued_utterance> it ' s why i ' m here . i ' m afraid i have some . very bad news to tell you , the . worst . kind of news . <continued_utterance> <person> died last night . in a fishing accident . in white sand bay .
<person> .
i ' m gon na be so late .
<person> !
ok , a hundred bucks .
over easy .
this one ' s tricky . <person>-side-up .
why me ?
cause you ' re the man , right ? the magic man . if it ' s got something to do with the wire , sooner or later it washes up on your beach .
has he confessed , yet ?
apart from his name , i can ' t get a word out of the runt .
this is a <person>-driven operation , son , and the <person> thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground .
you heard the sky marshall . move it all down -
hold it . <person> , you ' re a pretty cheerful person , aren ' t you ?
am i ? <continued_utterance> all right , i am , i know it ! all my life , i ' ve just been . upbeat . optimistic . <person> . i can ' t help it . even when i was little , i remember my mother used to say , `` that child is pure sunshine . she ' ll either be a nun -- or a stewardess . ``
what do you want ?
<person> got us another gig .
oh , <person> .
<person> . do you hear me ?
no , we checked his story with a tipster . he was cleaned by two grifters on <number> th .
they workin ' for anybody ?
was the bus on time ?
yes .
no , starling , there isn ' t time . and you ' ve still got crucial work to do in ohio . we want him for murder , not kidnapping . i ' m counting on you to link him to the bimmel girl , before he ' s indicted .
yes sir . i ' ll do my best .
you ' ve been busy with that trial , i suppose . such a travesty . <continued_utterance> they only arrested that poor soul because he ' s japanese .
seattle boys think he ' s guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
you dying .
the secret of it . that only magicians . can ever understand . <continued_utterance> see , when we die . our body goes away . our body . but
that ' s boss .
hi boss .
some .
lie . that ' s one . keep going .
you want to work uptown nights ?
i ' ll work anywhere , anytime . i know i can ' t be choosy .
you ' re kidding , i ' m in real estate ! <continued_utterance> with long and <person> . who are you with ?
me ? um . you know , i haven ' t really decided yet . i might check out long and <person> .
conjugate me a verb , <person> . for instance , to promise ! camera tracks with them in a close two shot . <person> is alert now . <continued_utterance> you told me you ' d break up that romance - when ?
you want something done , j . j . , but i doubt if you yourself know what ' s involved .
who wants true ? who wants moving ?
drop that attitude . here ' s some- thing really worth while .
i suppose i was . i poured a drink . would you like it ?
no . i -- i guess i ' m not what you expected .
my thighs are fat . and no diet works . the only way to lose weight on your thighs is amputation .
you have to amputate <person> the kid .
the flesh is gelatinous , the skin is very porous and very moist . this is another guess , but it probably comes from a planet that receives only reflected light , perhaps from a ring of moons . its atmospheric pressure is slightly less than ours and it contains a great deal more water .
dr . <person> , <person> here in washington . can you give us an idea of why they ' re here ?
how long do i wait to call ?
a day .
<person> --
you did , didn ' t you ?
`mai <person> . oh , the written word . that ' s what the country does to you ; turns you into one . what ' s up ?
it ' s a shame it doesn ' t fit . perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it .
i was joking .
stop joking . who are you ? are you an operative ?
so . you got your reward and you ' re just leaving then ?
that ' s right , yeah ! i got some old debts i ' ve got to pay off with this stuff . even if i didn ' t , you don ' t think i ' d be fool enough to stick around here , do you ? why don ' t you come with us ? you ' re pretty good in a fight . i could use you .
<person> ' t worry , <person> . i like you more . i do . <person> ' s just fun .
i ' m fun .

well . i made a little decision that i hope you ' ll be happy about .
oh , honey . you finally got <person> .
<person> pelcher ? you ' re kidding ?
<person> , for about a month now . <person> , just stay away from <person> , okay ? and stay away from me . stop trying to rescue me . those days are over . i ' m a big girl now . stop trying to save me , okay , because i don ' t need saving . just . give up on me .
edmunds ?

the queen , the rothchilds , the gettys , the vatican , and colonel sanders before he went tits up . oh , i hated the colonel with his wee beady eyes . and that smug look on his face .
<person> how can you hate `` the colonel ? ''
no , i like him .
<person> , you like everybody .
`` i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows '' -- becky flops on the couch .
and this woman is a writer ! that ' s what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers .
experience ! right ?

<person> , <person> . <person> to hear that .
i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine . and one of the fuel cells burst .

he ' s a surfer .

i am delighted ; any chance to go aboard <person> , however briefly , is always an excuse for nostalgia .
<person> ' s see what else we ' ve got .
what ' s that ?
what ' s this , then ? some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying ?

i don ' t know . <person> , the strongest sense i had was that he ' s more than curious about you . he very much wants to know you . the same way you want to know him .
how could i not ?
i ' m not like you , <person> . you ' re lucky . you ' re smart . marrying the boss ' s daughter is a nice short cut to a career , isn ' t it ?

this isn ' t a game , captain .
she ' s not like the others in the senate , <person> .
it ' s been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns . and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds .

mr . <person> , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
only <number> in <number> male applicants make it through stellar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
eight point . no , uh , seven .
<person> ' s marrying <person> !

i can stop monsters , <person> . and because i can , i have to .
so is it a calling or a curse ?

<person> ' s only about <number> miles from here . i could be there in -

not if they feel threatened . the separatists don ' t have an army , but if they are provoked , they will move to defend themselves . i ' m sure of that . and with no time or money to build an army , my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help .
the armies of commerce ! why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them ?
if that ' s the way you feel . <person> , i ' m devastated . <continued_utterance> but if that ' s your decision , i ' ll have to learn to live with it . <continued_utterance> i told you . i love my wife . <person> ' t ever phone me again . <continued_utterance> beth .

i don ' t know what to say about it , <person> . it was a form of temporary insanity . but i had to tell you about it because --
-- it was a betrayal .
this dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her , right ? but <person> knows me from you , right , so she comes up to me and says , ' hey <person> why you following me ? ' i say , ' i ' ll buy you a drink and explain . ' and she says .
' so , do you enjoy watching me ? ' <person> turns and sees her in the doorway .
i can ' t afford to have an independent program monitoring me . do you have any idea how many outside systems i ' ve gone into ?
it ' s my fault . i programmed you to want so much .
you wanted by the law or somethin ' ?
naw , it ' s okay .
what are you looking for ?
a light switch . a button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power .
hey , your heart attack could be the best thing that ever happened to me .
i love ya .
uh . <person> , <person> . she doesn ' t mean that . <person> lost the old filter with her last stroke .
then i ' ll throw a few more treats on the plate . where ' s my smokes ?
yeah , but so far , i ' ve only given pain , i never got any .
all right , well you ' re battin ' a thousand here . your enzymes look perfect , your ekg is normal and the pain doesn ' t sound like the kind of pain we worry about . i think what you experienced was normal chest pain associated with stress .
you have changed so much
you haven ' t changed a bit . you ' re exactly the way i remember you in my dreams . i doubt if <person> has changed much either .
do you know what he ' s been saying to her ?
he ' s an actor , so it can ' t be good .
hi , <person> . have a seat . how are you at cleaning ?
i ' m very , very good at it .
<person> ? it ' s not <person> ' s fault i ran away .

<person> , well , you should be my agent .
i guess .
and it didn ' t stop you from wanting to protect them . did it ?
what did you do ?
threw on the emergency , jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - what do you think ! what do i have to do ? draw you a picture ?
yes .
how can you say that ?
go on , i want you to tell me .
well , she was dark , not too tall , rather pretty --
i don ' t think so .
<person> . the truth is that i ' m afraid you ' re going to ki . leave me .
on screen .
your defense perimeter is useless . you will be assimilated .

you do ?
i ' ve had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights . <person> ' t tell what they look like , cause they ' re staying in the shadows -- covert like . no one ' s got hurt mind you . and that ' s the give away .

you said you can ' t imagine what i think of you .
what ever happened to just bowling ?
there ' s a lot of competition for amusement out there . you got ta adapt to survive .
what ' s all your fault ?
none of your business .
that ' s your idea of logic ? i tell the judge i didn ' t murder the man - the judge says , `` why not you ? ''
only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both .
i ' ll see what i can do . but it ' s a waste of money .
oh ?
<person> is so fond of <person> .
i ' ve moved in with <person> .
not likely . are the speeders ready ?
not yet . we ' re having some trouble adapting them to the cold .
<person> , he knows that .

what ' s this guy here for , anyway ?
but he could be reporting back to your brother , couldn ' t he ?
<person> , dear , please forget all of this . what can it matter after tomorrow ?
and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future . only going through the dark side can we see .
it ' s been ten years , and the sith still have no shown themselves .
shut up .
what ' s going on there ?
until sundown .
oh my god .

free-lance ? oh really ? you think i don ' t see ? you think i took vows yesterday ? i know what you ' re up to . you and <person> .
what ? he drown ?
no . it turns out that he ' s from oceanside . california . you know , where they always hold those surf competitions ?
i still can ' t square the psycho smarts of whoever did <person> with those two cops .
i don ' t think those cops did <person> . i think whoever <person> was wearing for killed her .
<person> !
she went into that club , <person> .
<person> ? you want to lose twenty top soldiers to a phantom army and then abort the mission ? do you know what that would look like on my record ? or yours ? we ' d be explaining it for the next fifty years from some goddam assignment in god knows where , we ' d --
well , how ' s it gon na look when we lose the ship too ? how ' s that gon na look on the old record ? ' cause that ' s what ' s gon na happen if we don ' t get our ass outta here . we can ' t defend ourselves with no weapons and --
oh , you mean my step-daughter . well don ' t worry . she won ' t interfere with you . <person> -- i figure we ' ve been losin ' cattle over a place called <person> -- it ' s the back way into the topaz ranch and the perfect route for rustlers -- i ' m going to send you up to the line camp -- you don ' t mind working a lone hand -- do you ?
-- i like workin ' that way .
i can ' t even get
to notice me .

<person> ' t be defensive .
<person> , <person> , somebody ' s been feeding you a line of crap .
what ' re you talking about --
<person> title .

<person> ' fishin ' ?
ah . you ' ve an instinct for character and idiosyncrasy , old son . <continued_utterance> zip yer fly , <person> .
no difference . i interfered .
<person> . i ' m still not sure i did the right thing keeping it to myself . it felt disloyal to deborah . but my daughter really needed someone to be kind to her right then . so . so .
this is where you live ?
you bet .
the least i could do for you , <person> . besides , you know me .
and you needn ' t worry . i ' ll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know .
it matches the faxes , <person> . <person> perfectly .
why ' s greenville in blue ?
oh , right away . that ' s why you never saw me with anyone . you should ' ve noticed that . i miss him , though . i think i made a mistake .
<person> .
. it had no choice . the defensive grid was smashed . we ' d taken the mainframes . we ' d won . taking out connor then would make no difference . <person> had to wipe out his entire exist- ence . we captured the lab complex . found the . what- ever it was called . the time-displacement equipment . the terminator had already gone through . they sent two of us to intercept , then zeroed the whole place .
then how are you supposed to get back ?
the slammies ? ? ? i ' d kill for that ! ! !
would you pay $ <number> ?
i ' m going to marry <person> . i just have to get this out of my system .
right .
then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor ?
it was <person> . i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor , no questions asked . although dr . <person> stood up to him . and to dr . <person> .
i think it ' s contaminated .
you don ' t even know what that word means . <continued_utterance> it ' s not contaminated . it ' s just tap water . pour it in his bowl .
it didn ' t come out .
<person> , <person> . i need a photo .
i forgot your name .
dr . <person> .
one . you ' re moving in with <person> , no matter how fond you are of his wife .
i ' m some disgusted . with the human race .
i know i ' m no spring chicken , i figure i only got another <number> - <number> years in me . tops . but how ' bout we figure out a way to make this work .
<person> .
well , i ' m one of your biggest supporters . i tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you .
why , thank you <person> .
why are you here ?
to see you .
yeah . kind of .
tell me why ?
trust me , you do not want some lady suing you cuz she found this guy ' s tooth in her brand new fanny pack .
he ' s over here in fishing too .
so aren ' t you gon na pay me ?
yeah bollocks .
<person> , well , we ' re also on probation . you see , we ' ve actually trashed two other cars . the first time wasn ' t our fault , and the second time a bee flew in and i freaked out . <person> is , we trash another car , without a good reason , we ' re fucked . know what i ' m saying ?
sure .
now i think i have upset you . my english perhaps is coarse .
it is a little coarse , yes .
did you call someone you knew ?
i may have , as . as i said , i simply don ' t remember .
<person> side . i can ' t even remember how we met them . why are we here ?
do not make a scene .
same reason i put explosives around the habitat . for defense . for the power . to protect myself .
<person> what ? <person> ' s unconscious .
. such a pleasant sound .
mmm .
why not ?
see <person> , <person> ' s truck swerved off the road and ah . hit <person> and then a tree . she was pinned between the two .
why didn ' t you say something ?
i guess i didn ' t want to admit it . and when you ' re in denial -- you don ' t dial .
better take three . fingers nimbly shred the seal , open the pack . <continued_utterance> maybe they ' ll keep us waiting .
prejudice is like any obsession . <continued_utterance> there ' s a reason why we can ' t let go . even when we want to .
. the maid in the meadow . quoyle bunny i guess . <person> ' a daisy-chain necklace . <continued_utterance> . the tall and <person> .
well . she does have that posture goin ' .
nice . you sittin ' up with me .
s ' okay . someday you ' ll do somethin ' nice for me .
i thought you were enjoying yourself ?
let ' s take a carozza and look at the moon .
he ' s gon na hit ya with <number> grand , <person> . how much cash we got ?
not enough to cover a bet that big .
my daughter ' s always dreamed of bein ' a cheerleader . put her on your squad and i ' ll give you the guns .
you ' re kidding .
no , no , that ' s too far . try a more gentle stroke . it ' s all in the stroke . go ahead , now , honey - stroke . as the camera comes around the side of the whale , we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman . his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it .
<person> ' . here goes nothin ' .
no , seriously , if you ' re dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot , they give you free shit .
<person> . <person> minutes .
do this for me .
there ' s no way .
i just moved here , you know , and i don ' t have a space to work . do you think i could do some work for you , help you clean up or whatever you need , in exchange for using your shop ? you don ' t have to pay me .
somebody paying you for the table ?
maybe you can clean her toilet .
maybe i will .
well . he doesn ' t think it ' s god , but for different reasons than me . he ' s thinking : if i can figure out how to make it stop , than i am smarter than it is , and therefore it can not be god .
he has a point .
who wrote that ?
nobody ! you are writing it for me ! i gave you three pounds a month since .
nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . <person> told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her .
what did your dad tell you to do to <person> ? theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees . <person> catches him , grabbing his ankles .
release him ?
the sheik . clear violation of international law , congressional oversight statutes , a couple of treaties , the federal perjury statute , and my favorite , the logan act , for conducting your own personal foreign policy . i know the whole story , general .
i left my wallet . my credit cards , cash , fucking id , everything . we got ta go back .
big deal . we ' ll call right now and cancel your cards .
<person> . i told you <person> .
no , no , you ' re okay , you ' re just having control problems . <continued_utterance> i know this is really , really cheesy , but in a way this is one of the places in san francisco i ' m most proud of .
<person> . <continued_utterance> <person> ! over here !
<person> , i want to go home . can you call <person> to pick me up ?
young punk , mr . <person> n ' <person> , cocky as hell .

i have a new title , maybe .
huh .
i ' m from akron .

we build weapons , senator . that is our business ! of course we ' re prepared !
get on with it . <person> out the sentence . i want to see her suffer .

i ' m back .
you have fun ?
the funny thing is , i ' m not <person> either . i ' m <person> .
as in the . ?

they ' re not your friends . they ' ve held you back . kept you from your destiny .
that is not true . they have tried to help me .
it ' s only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies . but it goes deeper than that , doesn ' t it ? i can sense that <person> meant a great deal to you .
in a way , he was as close as i ever came to having a child of my own .
<person> , i don ' t fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns . so suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day .
but my day with <person> isn ' t over yet and --
what d ' you mean ?

she thinks you ' re a bucket of dog vomit . trust me on this .
she ' s my destiny .
your husband came home agitated , after his encounter with the deceased ?

i don ' t think i really want to see hell <person> . what ' s wrong with a normal gun ?
i have an appointment .
<person> .
the senator ' s white paper is almost ready , bets . should we wait for that ?
<person> usually just sends those to the national media . the local press doesn ' t know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway .
you need to remember that you still have a long way to go , a lot of hard work ahead of you before you make it . first , there ' s getting your shot in the american minor leagues : rookie ball , single , double , triple a - all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark . so , you better pull it together quick .
<person> nobody ' s gon na take this shit from a couple dominican rookies when you go to the u . s . for spring training this season . they glance up , eyes wide . did he just say .

that moment will come . and your heart is going to whisper , ' here it is ' winds his fingers . around her hand . <continued_utterance> and you ' ll come through .

<person> , i have given you every opportunity . to change . to make a decent life for yourself .
a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling .
so you ' re hoping <person> can get you re- instated ?
that ' s what you ' d say . <person> managed all <person> ' s business . besides which they was regular drinkin ' pals -- played poker together most nights -- tho ' they do say <person> got the worst of it .
<person> was a gambler , eh ?
yes . with your `` prestige '' it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of american tel and tel .
you ' re picking up my lingo , hon . <continued_utterance> <person> , i like this new attitude of yours . you ' re growing up and i like it ! i don ' t like it when you ' re limp and dependent , when you ' re odd and wayward . this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world . <person> , don ' t forget , dear , you won ' t always have me with you , will you . ?

sido-dyas . isn't he the jedi who hired you for this job ?
i can ' t believe you didn ' t get out .
<person> said .
oh , but <person> , i ' m sure this thing must be some practical joke . you know , <person> sometimes goes too far . of course i shouldn ' t be saying this to an outsider , but sometimes he ' s terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades .
but don ' t you understand , mrs . <person> -- your son is responsible for a woman ' s death .
i ' m proud of you , sis . you ' re going to do great things too . we all know it .
i ' m gon na miss you . <continued_utterance> c ' mon , let ' s dance .

into what ?
that ryan .
what a dick .
it would be verisimilitudinous .
yeah . i don ' t know . i have to speak to the fire marshal .
it ' s a toxic dart . i need to know where it came from and who made it .
one moment , please . <continued_utterance> as you can see on your screen , subject weapon does not exist in any known culture . markings can not be identified . <person> self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society .
the cannibal . <continued_utterance> yes , well . <person> , right . i ' m glad for the chance , sir , but - why me ?
you ' re qualified and available . and frankly , i can ' t spare a real agent right now . <continued_utterance> i don ' t expect him to talk to you , but i have to be able to say we tried . <person> was a brilliant psychiatrist , and he knows all the dodges . <person> on him , copy of our questionnaire , special id for you . if he won ' t talk , then i want straight reporting . how ' s he look , how ' s his cell look , what ' s he writing ? the director himself will see your report , over your own signature - if i decide it ' s good enough . i want that by <number> wednesday , and keep this to yourself . <continued_utterance> now . i want your full attention , starling . are you listening to me ?
well , come on then , <person> . i ' m hungry . get me a sandwich .

<person> , he should not have been given this assignment . i ' m afraid <person> won ' t be able to protect the senator .

what do you think this is kid ? <person> the dinosaur ' s pussy fucking kiddie hour ? huh ? this is real life with consequences you take to the grave !
<person> , we don ' t have watches .

<person> .
<person> ! !
so that was a typical lunch crowd ?
well , it ' s early in the season yet .
maybe i ' d better take the rest of the script home and read it -
oh no . i couldn ' t let it out of my house . you ' ll have to finish it here .
<person> . understand . i ' m not a military objective , reese . i ' m a person . you don ' t own me .
<person> ' s go . time to move out .
<person> , he ' s not you . he ' s a version of the truth of you . so to speak .
<person> to interrupt again but <person> wants to know , when <person> says , `` i love ya '' , you want that to be ' ya ' , not ' you ' , right ?
what are you trying prove ?
i ' m not like you , <person> . you ' re lucky . you ' re smart . marrying the boss ' s daughter is a nice short cut to a career , isn ' t it ?
<person> ' t you have any generators , or other fuel sources ?
maybe you ' d like to take your patient to the hospital in bozemen . it ' s only two hundred miles away .
<person> that , helmuth . you want to discuss symbols here ? this guy was a front man . he was the piper , but he played their tune , you get my philosophical meaning ? i ' m not interested in small fish , i ' m after <person> . come on , helmuth . <person> facts .

i ' m your man , mr . ho .
he ' s gentler than i thought . and he has a sense of humor .
<person> ' t forget our mission , <person> . we should act . now . time is running out .
so has the muse shone on you , greg ?
i ' ve been pretty distracted . most recently by those delicious cookie things that <person> brought round this afternoon .

<person> ' t give up . you ' re going to make it .
half my life is over , and i have nothing to show for it . i ' m a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper . i ' m a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage .
<person> , let ' s get you wired up . i hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn ' t screw up the squid receptors .
what ' s all this squid shit ?
<person> ! the guy ' s a sleaze-bag . she can ' t sing .
i don ' t think she can sing , either .
maybe ; if you did the wrinkles too .
oh , you ' re just coming on to me . <continued_utterance> in your column , you write about yourself . does that come easily ?
passport to the universe .
i ' ve been thinking about applying for federal service , too . <person> , maybe .
this is pretty unusual for me . i ' m not used to having sleepovers .

it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .
i ' m sure you look great . i ' m sure you look .
do i look okay , <person> ?
it ' s interesting .
your dad spent all his spare time in here . he wanted to make it absolutely perfect .

wait . please . <person> ' t . i --
spider-man ! <person> to me ! if he can do this with the train , if he ' s come this far , then i can pretty well predict his next step . he ' ll go to <person> <number> for the power . he must be stopped . or else he ' ll destroy our world .

<person> .
do you mind if we don ' t go through the usual bullshit about how i loved it ? <continued_utterance> i mean , okay , fine , but it ' s a motion picture .
thanks , honey , but next time , bring two , save yourself a trip .
all right , all right . <continued_utterance> i see customer service is alive and well on new <person> .
<person> did you just do that ?
<person> asked me some advice once , <person> .
yes , sir .
when i have fifty pounds .

y ' know . <person> `` meet '' ? to meet ?
oh . well , i ' m sorry about your mother . in half ?
and here ' s some hydrogen peroxide .
i don ' t drink .

a bunch of hollywood people were filming down in old town . they thought my mom was so beautiful and so talented that they gave her a speaking part . you want to hear it ? <continued_utterance> `i recommend the pecan pie . ' norah looks back at lynn for applause .
i recommend the pecan pie ?
. and <person> never walked again . they transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate . to my knowledge , he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw . <continued_utterance> i ' m thinkin ' <person> could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary .
<person> good to us . figure we owe him for the beer .
. that ' s what you ' re looking for . ?
. i . uhh .

something good game out of it . the dead can ' t speak . now i ' m their voice . <continued_utterance> <person> is dead , right ?
<person> ' t handle them myself is what you mean . <person> ' t . <continued_utterance> you don ' t trust me to be alone with them .

yes i understand .
<person> , mrs . <person> , we just got going .
i told you i ' m looking for someone .
<person> ' s in a different category .
we ' re dealing with degenerates here .

and tell them what , exactly ? run it by me once . practice , see how it sounds . anything else ?
afternoon ma ' am . <person> ain ' t it ?
no -- <person> -- miss <person> -- this is <person> .
affirmative , two .
two to one . you are still on twelve o ' clock . <person> to nine .

well , do they sell it here ?
i dunno .
i don ' t take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics . who ' s the injured party here , you ?
right now you ' re in no position to ask questions ! and your snide remarks -- -
not just in manhattan , <person> . <continued_utterance> you can ' t keep ringing doorbells and running away , calling her and hanging up . what are you afraid of ?
rejection . <person> and devastating . as long as she hasn ' t rejected me , there ' s hope .
this is its current position .
can you project its course ? <continued_utterance> <person> . i have nothing but sympathy for what you ' re going through . but right now , i need your full attention on the task at hand . if you can ' t provide it . then i ' ll have to relieve you of duty until <person> can remove this . emotion chip of yours . i ' m sorry , but you leave me no other choice . this snaps <person> back . he considers this for a long moment , then looks determined .
your instructors tell me you ' re doing well . top quarter of the class .
i hope so . they haven ' t posted anything .
i couldn ' t begin to guess .
me neither . it must be that you ' re married . do you get high , my friend ?
no , no , no . you were doing fine , you ' d been courteous and receptive to courtesy , you ' d established trust with the embarrassing truth about <person> , and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire . it won ' t do . it ' s stupid and boring .
i ' m only asking you to look at this , <person> . either you will or you won ' t .
that ' s what nightscopes are for , soldier . for the dark .
yes , sir . but the sixth rule is `` never give the enemy an advantage unnecessarily . `` if they ' re expecting us --

el ? i ' m sorry . i do love you . and you are a lady . i have so much respect . she turns and swings at him , catching him square in the nose ; he ' s stunned and bleeding .
it ' s left its mark still . the last thing these children need to do , is worry about some crazy things happening in the world . take them into town . get their minds -- your mind , on everyday things . it ' s good medicine .
it ' s good advice . say hi to <person> for me .
<person> ' t let your personal feelings get in the way . we ' ve got a job to do .

what do we use for defense ?
we ' re a habitat . not a castle . the only defense we have is <person> .
so , <person> , now that you ' re here , why don ' t you finish the pancakes and i ' ll get back to work .

huh ? . eh . no , there isn ' t
yes .
so -- we ' ll leave you be .
it ' s been destroyed . the borg threat is over . are you all right ? the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment .
we ' re fine , sir . it will take some . time to explain .
i was taken from my homeworld by people called the `` pakjeds . `` they are fat . they traded me to a ship belonging to the `` bolians . `` the `` bolians '' are blue . they put me in a seat and asked me questions . then they were attacked by another ship . time passes . and still the b- <number> is yammering blandly away . he is more fully assembled by this time <person> is thoroughly bored . <continued_utterance> then people called the delviciansans picked me up . they have long teeth . they asked if i do anything to help them . i told them i could do whatever they wanted . they asked me to clean out the matrix manifolds . i told them i did not know what an matrix manifold looks like .
excuse me . i have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things .
then what happened ?
that was it . we came out of the bedroom and had coffee with everybody .
you got away . i didn ' t . that is all . no , no tears . tears mock me all the more .
<person> , i am looking for-
why wouldn ' t i report you ?

i lose more than that running for the bus . i ' l l do it for a caravan .
a what ?
then the droid does belong to you .
<person> ' t seem to remember ever owning a droid . <person> interesting . <continued_utterance> i think we better get indoors . the sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers .
degenerates ? <continued_utterance> a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone .
that ' s why he didn ' t get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he couldn ' t answer . why didn ' t he go and direct in america , like that italian , <person> .
<person> , we need you !
we ?
yes , my aunt . but perhaps she wept a little . tell me how you love her , <person> .
like a sickness and its cure together .
it ' s not worth the risk .
it ' s also our only way out of here ! it holds three people . and there ' s only three of us left now .
maybe .
which one of those women is in charge here ?
it ' s not that big a deal . it ' s seventy-five people in a room that ' s partitioned in half .
it ' s just -- i ' ve already had two big weddings .
well . i ' m sort of working with <person> and he suggested we kind of keep it between us . he thinks that my theory is . well , i don ' t know .
the scoundrel . i want to see that data , <person> !
why do you ask ?
i ' ve seen a lot of suspicious- looking people around here today .
<person> . perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important , things like an orchestra , a school . that ' s his country . maybe he has an old mother who can ' t be left alone . maybe he has brothers , sisters . you can ' t .
<person> . he had no sisters , no brothers , only a lot of love affairs .
i want you to do this work .
me ? i ' m busy . just finished one script . i ' m due on another assignment .
get out . you got ta get me out . !
general <person> , sir ?
excuse me , <person> , i ' m with the san francisco police department . i ' m on official business and i ' m afraid i have to commandeer your vehicle .
no .
so that makes what would have been $ <number> into $ <number> , doesn ' t it ? if you sent the equity back , you had a profit of $ <number> .
is that your third question ?
the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got . finally i could only come to one conclusion . <person> was created with temporal rna sequencing . he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly , so he could replace you .
but the romulans abandoned the plan .
yes !
what do you mean , `` ' yes '' ?
it ' s constitootional , i reckon . like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he ' s too sane . believes in law and order .
what ' s wrong with law and order ?
<person> and i - we took the boat out , we were fishing , and then it was dawn and we ' d caught absolutely nothing .
well , we ate everything without you .
i saw . $ <number> fifteen minutes . $ <number> half hour .
<person> .
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling . you got ambition like a . like a . blowtorch . you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht ! - shish kebabs . maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good . i think i could help you , theo .
how mr . <person> ?
so why <person> . why d ' ya have to do <person> ? she never hurt anybody .
picture it . i feel like i got ta share this with somebody . it ' s too perfect .

what ' s the matter ?
i saw a monster . can i have a glass of water ?

poitier . he ' s a young black man . or maybe <person> . i don ' t know the exact name -
how much would you charge me for the lips ?
more than you could afford .
<person> did this ?
no . <person> ' s the one on the ground .
i better get back .
<person> night , <person> .

nope , i couldn ' t care less .
i ' m sure you wouldn ' t care if he needed your help , right ?
but i came here to . <continued_utterance> . to beg you . not to do it .
i ' d have thought this was the answer to your prayers . lose the witch , and her two brats , in one swoop . problems solved . <person> is clearly distraught . this is no act .
i don ' t care -- i ' m not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me .
you little fool -- if you go to <person> with that man -- you stand to lose everything .
my heart bleeds .
what dp i do ?
excuse me .
try the wine .
your presence is soothing .

i don ' t know . <person> ' t look like anybody got hurt in this one .

we ' ll do that . but how are we going to hold him ? he can change himself into a man . he can disappear .
that ' s the chance we have to take .
i know , i know . <continued_utterance> i know , it ' s the hardest thing in the world . and it seems everybody wants .

come in . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
you ' ll learn .
you know every story , every wound , every memory , their whole life ' s
<person> ! where did you learn to speak german ?
i just know a couple lines .
i knew how much you wanted it .
but i was going to buy it for myself .
yes , the mormons brought in two .
we came here to be actors .
i ' m telling you the truth .
now approaching <person> . <person> , next stop .
still , please .
<person> showed me the new dress .
<person> . what else do you see , feel , taste .
a margarita . a cuban cigar .
yeah . <person> too .
then let ' s each get our bearings .
mate , <person> and serena .
oh right .
this little one isn ' t worth the effort . come let me buy you something .
no blasters ! no blaster !
dad .
it ' s a business lie , not a real lie .
the railway fare -- well , i reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits .
but , mr . -- er -- i don ' t know your name .
tractor beam .
we don ' t have a tractor beam .
<person> -- what a woman ! what a part ! the princess in love with a holy man . she dances the dance of the seven veils . he rejects her , so she demands his head on a golden tray , kissing his cold , dead lips .
they ' ll love it in pomona .
get her !
which one !
why didn ' t you say good-bye ?
you were gassing away to nicola .
mmm .
that we could use you in and i think that ' s quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good .
i love you guys . you ' re animals ! <continued_utterance> it ' s <number> : <number> , i told you there ' s no one to pick up <person> .
but you ' re not <continued_utterance> we don ' t know if you ' ve got it , we haven ' t seen it yet ! now go back and finish !
scanners and sensors still inoperative . there ' s no way to tell what ' s inside the station .
and no way of knowing if <person> is still in the area .
i won ' t be making the trip .
<person> , get up here , now .
i don ' t know . it ' s a hard grape to grow . as you know . it ' s thin-skinned , temperamental , ripens early . it ' s not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected . <person> needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world . and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really , can tap into <person> ' s most fragile , delicate qualities . only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can <person> be coaxed into its fullest expression . and when that happens , its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet . <continued_utterance> i mean , cabernets can be powerful and exalting , but they seem prosaic to me for some reason . by comparison . how about you ?
what about me ?
<person> . good ?
yes .
hey lisa , did you run into <person> last summer ?
no .
then what is it ? <person> ' t you already know who the bomber is ? <person> ' t you have all the answers ?
we have no answers . only corpses .
i ' m gon na miss you .
i ' ll miss you , too , <person> .
see if they make sense . to begin with , i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer ' s sick mind .
psychopaths sell like hotcakes .
this is a tasting , sir . not a bar .
just give me a full goddamn pour .
what ' s your real name ?
i don ' t like my real name .
it ' s obvious he has feelings for you . are you saying , little baby sister , that you haven ' t noticed ?
i ' m not your baby sister , <person> . <person> and i are friends . our relationship is strictly professional . <person> , would you tell her to stop it ?
. so there they were , this goofy old codger and his dog , big as life .
<person> , really . lives like a hermit in a run-down shack . no one to look after h .
<person> , somebody else go . come on , let ' s go , somebody else , right now .
<person> , look --
we ' re putting together our annual `` age '' issue -- and we ' d like you to do forty .
<person> . who am i interviewing ?
extracted ? extracted by whom ? i see .
his name is <person> bin <person> . he ' s iraqi . and something of a religious leader .
<person> . who ' s <person> to you ?
she ' s my mom .
oh yeah , you caught us .
oh well , then i ' ll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals .
<person> . talk some more .
about what ?
you ' re wrong ! ! he would never do anything like that ! ! let ' s go .
he had gloria in his hands !
i ' d like a shot at laertes . i think it ' s a much better part .
do you think it ' ll hurt me ?
in his lab . he won ' t let you in .
he ' ll let me in .
well , whad ' ya know .
<person> ' t mess with the boss . so what ' d the captain say ?
i ' m not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends .
now i think i have upset you . my english perhaps is coarse .
it ' s all you .
i ' m trying to get into the show , but i mean . what is this ? it looks like somebody napalmed the garden of eden .
i love ya .
i love you too . if that ' s what you said . i don ' t know if it ends in ' ya ' if it ' s an official i love you but .
some people just don ' t fit the mold . and so far .
hey , if it ain ' t broke .
you ' re a lifesaver .
you did your hair different .
emotions ?
i ' ll explain later .
hi , <person> . where ' s the chief ?
who ?
thank you , colonel .
captain .
very well .
i don ' t believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities .
hey , <person> . long time no see .
gary .
so . how are things working out at <person> ' s ?
oh , he ' s great . <person> too . i thought this summer was going to be a train wreck , but it ' s not turning out too bad .
my internal sensors tell me the ambient temperature in the room is ten point two degrees <person> . but my
they ' re not your friends . they ' ve held you back . kept you from your destiny .
why do we stop here ?
if you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs .
but you didn ' t lose me .
no , honey . and we will thank the lord for that every day and night <continued_utterance> for the rest of our lives . but you almost died , and you were badly injured , and you won ' t be . you can ' t .
i ' m sure you ' re good , but all that paper leaves a trail . <person> gets too curious -- fbi , irs , whatever -- that trail ' s gon na lead to somebody .
sure it will . but not to me , and certainly not to the warden .
can i get that ? he reaches for his cellular , connects with . mace , over by the bar .
<person> , where the hell are you , i think <person> ' s got beemer looking for you .
they ?
dead people .
they all wind up like you ? the other agents ?
no . they ' re dead now . <continued_utterance> they broke down . then they opted out . killed themselves . after a while , those conversations about the yankees became impossible . ya see ?
<person> ' s not a jedi yet , counsellor . he ' s still a padawan learner . i was thinking .
hey , hold on a minute !
he ' s got a good lawyer , and he made a smart move . we ' ve got a scared witness and a suspect who proved `` good will '' by turning himself in .
what about when she identifies him ? !
who else you got . ?
. we got the boyfriend , <person> .
mkay , children , you ' ve all made terrific progress , and are hereby done with the eight step program . the kids all ad lib relief .
<person> , that sucked ass .
but that ' s what happened .
but it ' ll stop the movie .
<person> . <person> , see you tomorrow . it ' s really good to meet you . <continued_utterance> let ' s go .
i thought you were enjoying yourself ?
what ?
i ' m gettin ' too slow for this racket . i done the best i ' m gon na do . you hang on too long , you start embarrassin ' yourself .
<person> ' s get a bottle of whisky .
<person> that .
what for ?
to have my baby and be with you .
<person> . enough !
who says ?
nice sheets
<person> ' t they nice sheet ? bed , bath and beyond . stop .
i don ' t even know what that means .
the other time . was a year ago . <continued_utterance> that was a tiny lump in the breast . we radiated , we thought we had it all . we were hopeful . but there were no guarantees .
you ' re qualified and available . and frankly , i can ' t spare a real agent right now . <continued_utterance> i don ' t expect him to talk to you , but i have to be able to say we tried . <person> was a brilliant psychiatrist , and he knows all the dodges . <person> on him , copy of our questionnaire , special id for you . if he won ' t talk , then i want straight reporting . how ' s he look , how ' s his cell look , what ' s he writing ? the director himself will see your report , over your own signature - if i decide it ' s good enough . i want that by <number> wednesday , and keep this to yourself . <continued_utterance> now . i want your full attention , starling . are you listening to me ?
yes sir .
<person> .
do you know who <person> is ?
do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? <person> ' t tell anyone what you just told me .
c ' mon , <person> -- that report ' s like the blind leading the blind .
no , but something ' s gon na blow in this town . i can feel it .
are you fucking with me <person> ? is something gon na happen to <person> ? <person> seems to be trying to tell theo , but is unable .
we don ' t need any of your help .
h-a-a-a .
you weren ' t hired to miss him .
there wasn ' t any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and didn ' t leave no footprints in the hall .
to my grave . he was going to kill me .
it ' s over . <person> me take you out tonight . <person> ' s have some fun . i owe you that .
coffee . two coffees . it says `` <person> time '' , right ?
that ' s right .
<person> is helping your career , isn ' t he ? apparently he likes you . and you like him , too .
i never thought about it .
these are not the droids we ' re looking for .
he can go about his business .
oh , nothing , i just wanted to make sure you were still coming , you know , and that you didn ' t get caught up at a cocktail party or some club .
<person> . i ' m gon na be there .
are you a good doctor ?
i got an award once . from the mayor .
excuse me ?
when i touch this piece i feel a longing . i imagine the woman who owned this , loved a man deeply she couldn ' t be with .
oh no .
<person> . ?
couldn ' t you just do a phone interview ?
not for the kind of place i want to do . i won ' t be in chicago that long .
do you have family here ?
no . my wife and kids are still in mexico .

of course i can , sir . it ' s like a second language for me . i ' m as fluent in <person> .
tea . <person> . hot . <continued_utterance> come . <continued_utterance> counselor . what can i do for you ?
actually . i ' m here to see if there ' s anything i can do for you .
no , i just wanted to bring the girl back . he shoots <person> , who falls .
. is she safe ?
who ' s he ?
also a conductor . <person> brilliant . <person> . von der <person> called him ' the miracle von <person> ' . <person> was outraged and they say he had von der <person> conscripted into the army . the same thing happened to another critic . true or not , it ' s not such a bad idea . critics give you bad reviews , you have them sent to the russian front . but if you really want to get <person> , ask him about <person> von <person> .
i thought you liked mr . <person> .
<person> , before mrs . <person> started working there . now he ' s a full on gym teacher , i swear to god .
<person> ' t call me dumb !

i ' ve got <person> .

well , let ' s see . first of all , you fuck pigs .
<person> tracked ?
that above and beyond guy was there . <person> . we got talking shop and --

the renting agent and the tailor .
steering wheel .
gear shift .

yeah . this is a really good pillow .
<person> . no-one has seen <person> since san -

anxiety .
that ' s what she said .
where have i heard that name before ?
you know what a mixer ball is ? it ' s like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . <person> grumpily waves at him to sit .
what are you doing over at the lanes that ' s so dangerous , <person> ?
there ' s a stretch of ground between guessin ' and provin ' , sheriff . i ' ll give you that .
what do you think you ' re lookin ' at now ?
at <number> we received a distress call from <person> , priority code , requesting reinforcement .
i thought <number> th brigade cleaned out <person> .
couldn ' t get on the boat . i ' d just <continued_utterance> no sense to have
<person> , if <person> lost both batteries , dead in the water , his radio wouldn ' t work . so how would he signal for help ?
what was his crime ?
he attacked his neighbor with a machete . there was a woman involved .
a lifetime of violence will do that . my nose was broken four times . and my jaw . but so much is the same . the eyes , you recognize the eyes .
yes . the eyes have it .
no .
i feel like i ' m going crazy here . you ' re <person> . but he ' s dead . i don ' t know what ' s real anymore . i can ' t be here with you . <continued_utterance> do you understand what i ' m saying to you ? you can keep the car . that should be enough for gas from here to there . <person> let me go .
oh , <person> ! no !
come on , come on with me , come on .
did you , um , did you get that pilot ?
no , man . i know you didn ' t get it ' cause you wouldn ' t ' ve asked me . it wasn ' t that funny anyway .
what ' s this item usually go for ?
seven dollars in any rock and gem shop .
we ' ll take another round .
another ?
you alright geezer .
i ' m sweet . come in , man , come in .
the white dog . sometimes with the skinny ghost . kids do things like that , it ' s called imagination . like the necklaces .
you know how many she makes ?
for abandoning you .
`` for abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover <person> . ``
the subject of the evening ' s medical update is you and your spleen and our host -- she flips the dial back the other way .
our caller is from seattle .
mmm . like -- <person> mimes fellatio .
<person> ?
no , my father didn ' t fight in the wars . he was a navigator on a spice freighter .
that ' s what your uncle told you . he didn ' t hold with your father ' s ideals . thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved .
god , that drives me crazy ! that whole `oh , i ' m sorry , i ' m just a big fuck up ' routine . <person> that ' s a legitimate excuse .
i really am sorry . but it really isn ' t all my fault , <person> .
it ' s not much different from enterprise . when i was a guest aboard her some years ago , <person> kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals . and now , mr . <person> , let us review : you say you have no details of project ' <person> ' ?
beyond what i told you , sir , it is classified information .
you lie . <continued_utterance> you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed .
my love is no lie . i have a wife , yes , and i can not marry the daughter of <person> de <person> . it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that . and yet you let me come to your bed .
no .
why not ?
<person> ' s giving him to the bounty hunter .
<person> wants us all dead .
is there a firing range around ?
sure , here , take this card , go to this place and give ' em the card . they ' ll charge you , but there won ' t be any hassle . <continued_utterance> you in nam ? can ' t help but notice your jacket ?
maybe not this much but .
and did you bring the other thing ? <continued_utterance> this is just to thank you for your brilliance the other night . i hope it suits you .
but what about those fighter ?
chewie , just do it .

i want a composite of the suspects in circulation by the end of business today . <person> , you cross-check it against the mainframe . <person> , have you got the lab analysis on the paint ?
not yet .
anything you put in my mouth , you ' re going to lose .
you don ' t understand . you do that , i ' ll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear .
tell me . just start at the beginning .
there was a war . a few years from now . nuclear war . the whole thing . all this -- <continued_utterance> -- everythingis gone . just gone . there were survivors . here . there . <person> knew who started it . it was the machines .
<person> . <continued_utterance> what ? !
eh . police .
i volunteered .
you volunteered ?
how can that possibly suck ? i ' d be fuckin ' psyched if i ' d gotten with a girl that hot . you got , like , two dozen handjobs !
and three quarters of a blowjob , but that was fuckin ' it . it was the peak of my ass- gettin ' career , and it happened way , way , way too early .
i was in there in him .
did you or <person> talk to her about it afterwards ?
so this other guy ? he ' s a terminator too , right , like you ?
not like me . a t- <number> . advanced prototype . a mimetic polyalloy .
what did you say to them ?
i didn ' t say anything to them .
<person> , when you meet someone and you ' re attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
i don ' t even know him . but i ' m having all these fantasies about a man i ' ve never met , who lives in seattle .
not at all . it taught me a little sense . i got me a job in the mail room , worked up to the stenographic .
come clean , <person> . at night you weep for those lost closeups , those gala openings .
no , you two wan na be alone . see you .
stay for a nightcap !
you got some front coming round here ain ' t ya <person> ?
never mind what i got , i am looking for <person> ?
what doctor ?
<person> ' s doctor . she has moments of melancholy . there have been some suicide attempts .
aw . she ' s all the way downstairs .
well , go downstairs and tell her that <person> said it ' s okay for you to go to <person> ' s
are your parents currently citizens ?
no , sir .
i was hanging out here waiting . <person> ' t give you guys a lift ? <continued_utterance> this is killer . incredibly hard .
yes , <person> .
wait a second , i -- <continued_utterance> <person> , c ' mon , alright . gim me a minute . let me get my bearings -- <person> pushes him again .
c ' mon , norman .
. his shift - yes .
. excuse me .
what was edmunds doing outside ?
resetting the sub .
<person> promised me he would never take off this ring .
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this .
i ' m surprised you didn ' t do a fucking runner ?
what are you talking about ?
obi-wan <person> .
please . <continued_utterance> i trust you are going to enjoy your stay . we are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season .
yes , <person> .
he must keep it with him at all times .
<person> to you . i got an audition for a pilot at nine and i ' m going . you got ta get out with some beautiful babies . you can ' t sit home thinking about her .
i don ' t know .
why ? !
ow ! you ' re fucking hurting me .
<person> .
of course . <person> . i knew that !
<person> ' s in january . so , how ' bout if we still know each other by then we go to paris for our birthdays .
maybe . . .
no . i hate the damn school . but that ' s because they keep sending my daughter home anxiety-ridden , mostly over geometry . i mean you `` get '' bernice . in a decent world her school should let her know how great she is , right ?
very right .
i ' m completely serious . there is something very important missing from that spacecraft . you know what that is ?
not a clue .
you won ' t hear that from hooks .
you want me to say that .
so , what about you ?
do i want you ?
what are the odds on <person> ?
eight to one .
if you were to ask me , i think the best thing to do is -- garvey stops and glares .
i ' m not asking you -- and don ' t bother me with your silly questions -- we ' ve got to do something besides talk .
forget the contract . <person> . what is it ?
i don ' t want to take my shirt off in that con . what are these things that they ' re asking of me . ? wha . wha . wha . i try to be good . the only thing i care about is .
oh god ! oh .
i need <person> . <person> .
i think a skin cell ' s the more likely of the two .
why ?
how can the sphere do that ?
i don ' t know , <person> . i ' m not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when <person> came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page <number> . how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page <number> talks about a giant squid .
i don ' t know you , but i ' ll be honest with you . i don ' t like this . i don ' t like any of this . especially , the water .
<person> ? a marine biologist ?
<number> % <person> . <person> vineyard . they don ' t even make it anymore .
<person> ? how come it ' s white ? <person> ' t noir mean dark ?
i know . <person> , if <person> finds you talking to me he ' ll hurt you .
i ' m already hurting .
you should feel like shit .
i figured , what the hell , i could take the prick ' s money and make sure <person> was ok at the same time . do us both good . <person> ?
<person> -- it ' s so much more complicated than you can imagine .
i know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but i ' m just a big pile of love today -- and i feel bad for the guy . he said he ' s been writing you -- but you never responded .
i ' m glad you asked . i ' ll tell you what was wrong with it . and what was wrong with it was it was behind the times . now : you want to bring business into this town ? you have to plan for a waterford that does not exist . not at the moment , no .
morning , darling .
. and boy does it hurt when they ask .
i don ' t even tell them about anything i ' m close on anymore .
mph rmph rmph rmph ? !
<person> ! he ' s not haunting us , he ' s trying to tell us something !
i do not agree . although you share the same genetic structure , the events of your life have created unique individual .
but so much is the same . on a biological level he is . and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do . i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him .
<person> morning to you . whatsa matter ?
i can ' t get it to come out right .
what do you want ?
get off me !
trash rats !
sound off , trash rats .
i grew up in santiago . what are you doing in new york ?
i came to work . i used to play baseball .
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to <person> , all by himself . he was afraid of catching cold .
hold me tighter .
<person> ? i am sorry , duty ? <person> fucking duty . <person> is , you americans want everybody to live like you . we liberated <person> , major <person> , not you . our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture . dymshitz bursts out laughing . <person> , <person> advances on him , almost as if he ' s about to attack him physically . he stops , sways a little , then , after a moment , drops down in a chair near to dymshitz . they drink . intimate:
i ' m gon na get that fucking bandleader , <person> . no deal . no fucking deal .
as opposed to tonight ' s standing violation . you think marriage is going to make you faithful ?
yes .
wow !
i ' ll just try the first one . <continued_utterance> <person> ! it ' s a lady giving a blow job to a horse ! <person> and <person> rush over .
i don ' t believe this is happening again .
oh my god . is he . are you gon na make sure he ' s alright ?
they used to hang people here .
that ' s not correct . where ' d you hear that ?
i can ?
you bet your life . `` the mill wheel goes around . some times it ' s even under water -- then it rises up , as high as it can go . ``
it ' s dark now , sir .
you ' re afraid of the dark , sergeant caine ?
permission to come aboard , captain ?

that ' s . the good n .
well . compared . <continued_utterance> your wife was in a red <person> which went through a guardrail over the chesapeake bay bridge . <continued_utterance> they were doin ' <number> in a fog . the <continued_utterance> car was cut in half by the impact with the rail . her male companion ' s body floated up downstream .
<person> , i ' ve always been on the square with you .
i ' m sure you have <person> .
we don ' t release him . a judge releases him . you ' re an fbi man . that ' s what judges are good at , right ? it ' s not like we ' ve gone after him in proper prosectorial fashion . kidnaping him . holding him in isolation . `` fruit of the poisoned tree '' -- remember that one from law school ? oh , we ' ll have a big trial . everybody ' ll get their rocks off . but the fact is -- -- the sheik will walk . <continued_utterance> . and this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle . <continued_utterance> documentary evidence of <person> ' s whole operation .
why me ?
nothing . nothing at all . just two little things . that woman over there in the corner . she ' s <person> ' s friend , and her name is <person> .
no shit .

but he ' s been dead for three hundred . oh god . we ' ve gone back in time again , haven ' t we ?
oh .
they tell you everything in this book . <continued_utterance> it says they ' re probably very small -- like my height -- because , as their brains developed , there was no use for physical development . it says they ' re probably vegetarians , because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet .
no . <person> at it , braided parachute cord , two pieces of broom stick . you approach the victim from behind , loop it around his head and hold on for all your might . the more the victim struggles , the quicker he passes out . and now you have convenient handles to drag around two hundred pounds of dead kayaker .
that is a theory .
a diplomatic mission . we ' ve been invited , believe it or not . seems there ' s been some kind of internal political shakeup . the new praetor , someone called <person> , has requested a federation envoy .

<person> . man . fuck .

i guess so .
yessuh . <person> printshop . vacant for thirty years .

why is it moving ?
hello , <person> . how extraordinary that you came .
it was something my father always liked me to do .

no -- to -- it -- here . i have no real connection to our life here .
where the hell ' s the negotiator ?

i couldn ' t believe you were calling from downstairs . so great to see you .
you couldn ' t look better .
yes .
so he was mean ?
that ' s right .
did his parents attend to that ?
no , nothing like that . the ottos are what i ' d call model citizens . they ' re regular at town meetings . they give their opinions in a respectful way . they always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren ' t church goers .
and they loved <person> .
i thought a phone call was inappropriate . <continued_utterance> i could have taken you to that restaurant , but it would have been a waste of money . <continued_utterance> i know . i wouldn ' t know what to say . if it were you .
we ' re going to win this .
what if they turn me down ?
then we ' re in the same place that we ' re in right now !
they , have only made forty this year . you could find the maker of this engine ' s signature on the engine .
no it ' s true . i can ' t find ' him , but i know a man that can . <continued_utterance> tony . <person> . he ' ll find <person> for you .
that was wacky ! i almost lost you in the traffic .
what took you so long ?
<person> on earth .
however , we can also pray for other things .

yeah .
i know that . you think i don ' t know that ? `` i know that ' s a dumb way to begin , but it ' s the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i ' m just losing my mind . ``
you are . you ' re losing your mind . what about <person> ?
i would have made you immortal . tell <person> he has lost a new play by <person> shakespeare .
what does <person> care of that ? he is readying the curtain for <person> .
<person> ?

then i guess you ' re stuck . life sentence . no parole .
<person> well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you . <person> <number> .

it wasn ' t my fault ! they just showed up . it ' s helping the convent .
<person> , sure thing . but what about , like , appliances ? like a little color portable ? boom box ?
useless distractions .
because i ' d met someone else .
oh , okay .
the girl was in the car .
i treated you like a son or nephew .
it ' s very common to become emotional after having an episode like you ' ve had .
so it ' s not crazy for a man to do something entirely out of character after having a heart attack ?
you can ' t do this ! <person> ! <person> ! . i can ' t face life without you , and i ' m not afraid to die , you know .
that ' s between you and yourself , norma .
all of it .
in one goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ?

as i said , it is beyond our comprehension .
you heard him . i ' m a star !
norma , grow up . you ' re a woman of fifty . there ' s nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five .

the chancellor means well , <person> ' lady but he is incompetent . he has promised to cut the bureaucracy , but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever , no ? senator , the republic can not be fixed . it is time to start over . the democratic process in the republic is a sham , a shell game played on the voters . it will not be long before the cult of greed , called the republic , will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom .

oh , now you want to talk . you want to be my friend , is that it ?
<person> , these guys are the real deal .
<person> ? i was hoping .
i ' m glad you asked . i didn ' t want to be so forward . i mean , if you ' re waiting inside , then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite , and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there ' s the chance that you would really want to talk and it ' s me who ' d be busy , but in an attempt not to be rude , i sit there and listen to some story that you don ' t really want to tell and i don ' t really have time to hear . you know ?
i certainly hope so -- it ' s not myself i ' m concerned about --
-- of course not .

the minute i read that script i said .
you know , not so long ago , you could ' ve come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors , waiting for communion with their users . the building fund was doing well too . but now . . this so-called <person> is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators , grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters and shoot things at each other and <person> knows what all -- oh , it ' s enough to give you a crisis of faith .

she asked me what i was thinking about ?
you didn ' t have to get into it , baby .
if it were possible to generate enough power behind it , the anti-force could wipe out not just gravity . but all our universal forces at the same time . in effect . it would blast a hole between this universe and the next . each . would flow into each other . no blue universe . no yellow . end , finished , over .

who you got ?
wrecking crew .
it might only be a particle of preanimate matter .
then again it might not . you boys have to be clear on this : there can ' t be so much as a microbe or the show ' s off . why don ' t you have a look ? if it is something that can be moved .
do you know why the governor is the governor ?

<person> up .
she probably went home , lit some candles , put on some relaxing music , took a nice hot bath , and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator .
what ' s the `` nexus '' ?
it ' s a place i ' ve tried very hard to forget . <continued_utterance> that ribbon isn ' t just some random energy phenomenon traveling through space . it ' s a doorway . it leads to another place . the nexus . it doesn ' t exist in our universe . and it doesn ' t play by the same rules either .
you can call me <person> if it makes you happy .
you got nice teeth <person> . <person> demonstrates an interest in rose bud ' s .

you don ' t even know what that word means . <continued_utterance> it ' s not contaminated . it ' s just tap water . pour it in his bowl .
it tastes funny .
why ?
the painters got to put the truck in , and you didn ' t park too good .
any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture , no matter what technical data they ' ve obtained . this station is now the ultimate power in the universe . i suggest we use it !
<person> ' t be too proud of this technological terror you ' ve constructed . the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force .
aw , screw it . it probably isn ' t all that good anyway .
<person> ! what the hell are you talking about ? ! you love terrance and <person> !
we want to talk to ya about <person> .
<person> ' t think i know him .

selling scrap metal .
<person> ? and what does this guy she ' s with do ?
i don ' t know . is it ?
or doesn ' t this all begin to suggest to you a kind of . negotiation ? there ' s something <person> can give me , and i want to trade for it . i even wrote to him , offering my help . but he hates me , so he won ' t deal directly . <continued_utterance> punishment , you see . for <person> . just like that gospel program . when you leave , they ' ll turn the volume way up . <person> does enjoy his petty torments .
no , sir . i am finding it difficult to concentrate . i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of . remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory .
what do you mean ?
thank you . <continued_utterance> what are we hugging about again ?
nothing . there wasn ' t supposed to be any crying at this celebration . just a lot of drinking and sex . <person> ' s charming , easy-going smile returns .
you don ' t understand . you do that , i ' ll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear .
<person> . but you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down . <person> . in fact , i understand the bite-reflex is so strong the victim ' s jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar .
<person> . and i was going to send you two and charge them to your amex .
i couldn ' t afford it . <person> is looking at her , looking through her .
bruno , <person> . <person> . <person> ' t you remember ? on the train . the voices of mr . and mrs . <person> can still be heard in dispute as bruno listens at phone:

the one that was weighted down . where is she . ? fred something .
<person> , from belvedere , ohio . the first girl taken , but the third body found . why ?
he can ' t know we ' re talking .

twenty-eight years .
to the same woman ?
what about it ?
do you like it ?
we head north , begin the grape tour up there , make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel . <continued_utterance> what ' s your problem ? <continued_utterance> what is it ?
i am going to get my nut on this trip , <person> . and you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit .

do you have a boyfriend ?
<person> for your help <person> .

almost three .
is this it ?
they said she was just rags , like somebody -
<person> , did <person> ever mention a man named <person> ? or <person> ? do you think she could ' ve had a friend you didn ' t know about ?

first things first , one of us , <person> , you get round to-the russian ' s . the second you see him call us .
you better be round with something substantial , don ' t turn up with a frown and a wagging finger .
i never had no hide stashed --

<person> ? that ' s funny . i haven ' t noticed that .
i ' m tired to death . i couldn ' t make it . i just couldn ' t make it , <person> .
where were you all day ? you look terrible .
you could have called me --
no way . no way i was going to be the first woman you went out with after . there is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after .
oh yeah . who cares ? i ' m the queen of typos . <person> , this is really starting to open up . what do you think ?
my palate ' s kind of shot , but from what i can tell , i ' d dub it pretty damn good .

my , dear , you are confusing sex with sleeping . sleeping is something i prefer to do alone .
dr . chilton - if <person> feels you ' re his enemy - as you ' ve said - then maybe i ' ll have more luck by myself . what do you think ?
you might have suggested that in my office , and saved me the time .
i ' ll get my people to work on it .
<person> .
oh , you can ' t let me do that . what precisely is your involvement with these people .
<person> ' s been a very important . project of mine for some time . i ' m the only one he ' ll deal with . he ' s very well-connected -- and extremely high-strung .

houseboats don ' t go anywhere .

<person> solid time of death . two years ago .
so before he died he got his paychecks , paid his taxes . <person> sporting goods stores . and had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors . that pattern continues a year after his death . he gets some paychecks . rents an apartment . buys a three thousand dollar kayak . pays his taxes . <person> and buried and still paying his taxes . then everything stops . last visa charge was to travelocity for a plane ticket to mexico city .
you broke it ! you broke it !

bought it . now , i ' m going to have to throw this beauty in the sea .
you didn ' t need to kill him .
yeah . this is great . i love this plan . drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in california to some weird place in colorado , and say hey , this ' ll be fun <person> . maybe we can go camping .
<person> , i know you ' re not happy about this . but it wasn ' t my idea for your father to have some kind of mid-life crisis and disappear with his secretary to mexico with our life savings .
all right . truth . i believe that one . why is it so urgent you couldn ' t wait until morning ?
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon .
what was i thinking ?
maybe you weren ' t thinking for once and look what a good time we had . <person> ' s not ruin something great .
perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion .
what do you mean ?
see , if you packed your piece you could ' ve made the guy see sense .
uh unh , carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket .
<person> , we can ' t fix up the house proper on a journalist ' s wages . so i have un-retired .
from what ?
he ' s smarter than we are .

but you can ' t kick me out ! guys want to kill me ! you ' re a nun ! a big nun ! <person> ' t you supposed to have compassion ? for the wayward sheep ? i mean , i ' m a major sinner ! all-time great ! hall of fame ! <person> ' t i , like , your dream come true ? your olympic event ? mother superior stares at christy .

nothing .
oh really ? nothing ? my dad doesn ' t do anything unless there ' s something in it for him .
<person> , but those grosses are inflated .
you think so ?
well , <person> said you wanted to see me ?
yeah . er , <person> . <person> o ' clock this morning , where were you ?
it ' s a formality . any case of damage to city prop . you hit the control box of the new stop light , and . they ' ll , uh , these things happen , i hope you ' re alright , and that you ' re feeling .
well , officer , don ' t worry ab .
i ' m off duty .
you mean you don ' t want to go out to <person> ?
you have a weakness for <person> .
i do .
normally , i would agree . but in this case , the mission requires a certain knowledge of <number> st century history . you ' re many things , <person> , but you ' re not much of an historian .
<person> luck , sir .
what happens if it doesn ' t match anything ?
you toss it and try the next one .
no-gah-buh- no ! rule number two - no names ! no goddamn names , you retard !
oh for chrissakes . `` white trash <person> . `` i didn ' t realize the rules went into effect before we entered <person> .

<person> where he went ?
maintain liberty , humanity and justice .
<person> , that ' s a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i ' m going to try to remember that . <person> , humanity and justice . <person> . but you used the word ' naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics can ' t be separated ?

oh that thing in queens .
i can not believe that . i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic . i know of your treaties with the trade federation , the commerce guilds , and the others , count . what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business . it ' s business becoming government !
are you willing to betray your jedi friends ? without your co-operation i can do nothing to stop their execution .
how could i be so stupid ? he ' s nowhere in sight . blast it !
<person> me , sir , but couldn ' t we go after him ?
they were slaughtering the spring lambs ?

and i am feeling that <person> on you .
<person> till tuesday . <continued_utterance> here -- time to re-join the world .
just don ' t get cocky . no one likes a dickhead . welcome to the team .
so , why do they call you <person> ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
you ' re not working at random house , i talked to them .
you what ?
what an asshole .
i believe it .
you don ' t have to do that , you know , we can start this relationship on something more than just that .
<person> , <person> . i know . i need you to eat my hairy love crack .
well , i hope he wins .
how are you , <person> ? i read about you in the papers .
<person> , now the cards are on the table .
yes they are . and i ' m serious . do not fuck with me . i am going to get laid before i settle down on saturday . do you read me ?
i got suspended when i was young , too . i was pretty cocky in my day .
they suspended me for <number> years .
i do care about you !
more bullshit ! more bullshit ! what kind of odds are they giving me ? there must be some kind of office pool . one month ? a couple of days ?
police work should be all about running around , following up crazy hunches that turn out to be right , going out on a limb .
well <person> , i ' ve never seen it that way . for me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public .
thanks , <person> . i ' m touched by your concern .
i just hate to see you pining away . it makes me want to vomit , frankly . <person> hearts are for assholes .
oh . i see . well , um , what happened to your mother , if i could ask ? i mean , <person> , that ' s an awful thing to ask . i ' m sorry . i don ' t mean to -- it ' s just that , i ' m --
oh , this is me . no , it ' s okay . she fell . <person> in her bathroom . hit her head . it actually split in half . horrible .
all i heard ' s a voice on the phone .
. you like girls . ?
i ' m gon na go talk to her .
you should go talk to her .
i ' m sure he won ' t be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him .
<person> , but if i get yelled at , i ' m never gon na listen to this show again .
it ' s the one thing that stands between me and the jungle .
to the jungle ! where outa the blue some shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole day .
. i can ' t . we can ' t . it ' s just not possible .
anything ' s possible . <person> , please listen .
you look sad , my lady ! let me take you riding .
it is not my riding day , my lord .
c ' mon , <person> , people do it in the movies all the time .
and they get caught !
what does the bonus cost ?
a gesture of friendship . but . we thought : if you see some of the yemenins - any of these , in particular . would you say <person> to them ?
she is my niece . she and her daughter live in the apartment i manage . <person> , who worked for you , lived there before she went back home . that ' s how i heard about the job .
so who am i interviewing ?
intelligence tells us he is most likely arab-speaking , between the age of fourteen and thirty . narrowing the target to fifteen thousand suspects . <continued_utterance> we can further reduce that number down to those who have been in this country less than six months . now you have twenty hiding among two thousand . <continued_utterance> if you are one of these twenty young men , you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background . unfortunately for you , you can only hide there . and that population , in the classic immigration pattern , is concentrated . <person> here in brooklyn . <continued_utterance> we intend to seal off this borough . and then we intend to squeeze it . this is the land of opportunity , gentlemen . the opportunity to turn yourselves in . after sundown tonight any young man fitting the profile i described who has not cooperated will be arrested and detained .
would you follow me , please . the general is expecting you .
no ! i will not let that happen !
but if they do , you must realise there aren ' t enough <person> to protect the republic . we are keepers of the peace , not soldiers .
-- the funeral shroud is the final step in the ritual of self- purification . first a fast , then --
-- the washing of the body , then the shroud . i saw it on <person> . tell me something i don ' t know .
not lately .
i did . i flew in a jet plans too . <person> ! man , that ' s a thrill ! almost blow the sawdust out of my head . i ' m going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon .
i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened . that ' s how i remembered it . but the truth is , i might have been doing sixty . or sixty five . and if that ' s true , that i was over the limit when the bus went over , what would happen then ?
that would complicate things .
so . i hear he ' s pretty good . <person> ' t seen him myself yet .
<person> ? <person> at what ? who you mean ? <continued_utterance> <person> <number> of <number>
not in this lifetime .
you know , <person> . may i call you <person> ? if you guys hadn ' t blown the surveillance , we ' d have been able to follow the money . what do you think , khalil , you would have led us right to your friends , wouldn ' t you ?
how do they know it ' s over ?
a mass evacuation by them started about eight o ' clock this morning . it ' s eleven now . they ' re leaving . <continued_utterance> you didn ' t think we ' d make it .
i ' m not playing the fucking victim . if i left now , i ' d never hear from you again . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you think that ' s sad ? <person> ' t you think that ' s sad ? you ' re my brother .
why is it always so dramatic with you ? everything is always the end of the world .
<person> in numbers ?
we can only hope so . <continued_utterance> he can ' t be allowed to use that weapon . all other concerns are secondary . do you understand me ?
see my mother ?
i only had a few hours . <continued_utterance> thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow .
what are you doing here ? at this time of night ?
you don ' t seem very pleased to see me , <person> . <continued_utterance> i brought you a little present .
<person> the loser . <person> of stolen dreams .
leave him alone , tran .
. <person> at the fireplace . you don ' t get workmanship like that anymore . <continued_utterance> ninety-seven five . what do you think ? <continued_utterance> <person> . you got him .
i don ' t know that <person> . he might get out . <person> ' s not bein ' straight with the witness , she could be in deep shit if she identifies him , and it ' s my job to convince her she won ' t be .
<person> ? <person> ' t forget who your real mother is , <person> . are you going to prefer her cooking to mine now ?
impossible . i love you , mom .
. and ?
turns out i get this part . they ' re selling some dish soap or something , and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything . they lock this girl and i into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks , and then they shoot the commercial .
no you are not !
from her address .
so this crummy welfare hospital called and remember i told you about my father ' s second wife . my ' stepmonster . '
the one who used to lock you in the closet all the time ?
<person> , mr . <person> .
you know each other ?
i can ' t help you with your writer ' s block -- until i see that look in dale biberman ' s eyes . the look that says she knows i ' m the one for her .
<person> , what about all the other women you were going out with ?
you wanted all this .
but -- don ' t you want --
but can i ask one impertinent question here ? with no criticism intended , because i know , <person> , you earn your ten percent , how come you let a sock act like <person> <person> tip-toe through town without a publicity build . ?
we ' re not buying it , <person> - no fish today .
i mean i want both of us to go .

yeah , what is it ?
it ' s a remnant .
steering wheel . gear shift . dashboard .
<person> .
what subject is your book ? non- fiction ?
no , it ' s a novel . fiction . although there ' s a lot from my own life , so i guess technically some of it is non- fiction .
your performance in the mound is not as good as last year . what is the problem ?
your performance in the mound is not good as last year . what is problem ?
of course . what happened to your face ?
my scooter . i fell off . getting chased by photographers . he hurries up the stairs , roverini in tow . ripley the telephone , the press , i ' ve been , i ' m feeling hounded - do you think you could not give out my address ?
shit . <person> , me and <person> are rooming together next year .
i don ' t even get what the big deal is , to be honest .
why would you be doing that ?
i think agents are safer when they have some company . i can send along <person> if you ' d rather .
i ' d like to hear . name me something bad you ' ve done in your life .
are you kidding me ?
when i twisted hair like this it means i ' m intimidated by you .
i ' ll keep it in mind , and use it against you .
it ' s not just a dream . it ' s real , you moron ! i know the date is happens ! !
i ' m sure it feels very real to you --
<person> ' t worry , sugar . the higgins are good people . i stayed with them last time i played here . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
then why don ' t you stay with them again ?

<person> ' t you going to drink your cocoa ?
goodnight moon , goodnight hush , goodnight mush , goodnight goodnight goodnight <person> -- <person> !

<person> ' s job is she works .
<person> , mommies work too . they work very hard . <person> works harder as a mom than she did when she was working . i just don ' t get paid .
well , no , i mean yeah i ' m fine , but listen . <person> , the craziest thing happened to me tonight .
does this have to do with a certain girl we talked about at dinner ?
two of the fingernails are broken off , and there ' s - dirt or grit under the others . she tried to claw her way through something . i ' ll scrape out samples after i ' ve printed her .
them fishhooks are set too close together . no wonder the franklin boys was scared to say they found her .
uh , are , uh , you-you ' re <person> , right ?
<person> .
i apologize if you ' ve been getting the wrong signal .
yeah . relocate where ?

anger , social resentment , sexual frus-
yes .
do you think if you saved <person> , you could make them stop . ? do you think , if <person> lives , you won ' t wake up in the dark , ever again , to the screaming of the lambs ? do you . ?
<person> . she ' s still going out with <person> . i saw them together at the movies two nights ago .
maybe she ' s just letting him down easy .
mrs . <person> . she went food shopping . she ' s running late .
<person> .

<person> part of no don ' t you understand ?
look , i will <continued_utterance> you ' re making a career decision here , i would strongly sugg .
well , what did you have in mind ?
i don ' t know -- a judge , couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after .
<person> minutes . that ' s all i could give you . no mission to fulfill . just . the two of you .
why would you do that ?
there won ' t be any murdering done around here , i don ' t mind telling ya .

no , i ' ll be fine here for tonight <number> as long as i ' m not putting you or <person> to any trouble . <continued_utterance> . what are you doing . with a coffin ?
that ' s not how you ' re supposed to ask . you ' re supposed to be a young lady who is very impressed with . my mind . having come from a deep hungarian film and getting cozy over a brandy , she says . ' is that . a coffin . ? ' and , then i say , ' yes , it ' s my coffin ' . ' your coffin , ' she would gasp , her interest in me growing by leaps and bounds . then ' i would sit back stroking her arm and say ' yes , i figured we ' re going to spend a long time in the ground together so i ' ve made friends with it . i ' ve gotten drunk on it . rolled joints on it . even made love on it many times ! ' it ' s a prop for affect .
he ' s getting away . !
thanks for your help , ma ' am .
it was the husband . the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman .
it ' s the right area , that ' s for sure .
becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was <person> , which meant he was cheating on her . she was completely hysterical . then it turned out the woman lived in duluth .
that doesn ' t make any sense .
where we going ?
anywhere . we ' ll talk about it in the car . <continued_utterance> hand me that box of tapes , will you ?
something awful has happened , <person> .
<person> down , <person> . <continued_utterance> there seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news . i ' m sorry , <person> , to be the one to tell you . it concerns your wife . she ' s been murdered .
<person> ? . oh . he ' s not here . he ' s gone .
you wouldn ' t lie to your professor now , would you ?
it just doesn ' t seem right .
<person> morally correct ? or right as in accurate ?
<person> ' t that censorship ?
no the mpaa is not a censorship group .
nobody likes a snoop .
but i came here to . <continued_utterance> . to beg you . not to do it .
you ever miss being married ? i bet you were great at it .
sometimes i miss it . at night . but not that much anymore . was one of us just saying something interesting ?
why haven ' t you told us about him ?
what ' s there to talk about ? he ' s just a boy .
that would be out of bounds . <continued_utterance> what was that ?
i don ' t know . <person> , games are fun . but head games are dangerous .
when can we do this again ?
what about <person> ?
is the man who kidnapped you there now ?
i told you . he let me go . i ' m on my way home .
sure thing , just don ' t take the train .
spider-man ! <person> to me ! if he can do this with the train , if he ' s come this far , then i can pretty well predict his next step . he ' ll go to <person> <number> for the power . he must be stopped . or else he ' ll destroy our world .
oh , skip it , <person> . it ' s pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband . especially when you ' re going to have another man ' s baby .
do you know , i think you ' re handsomer than ever ? <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
it seems to me it ' s your army - being that they are all clones of you .

the emperor commands you make contact with him .

i thought it was coming from here .
<person> , wait a minute , wait a minute . you can ' t drive ?
no .
what ' s in the case ?
i ' m sorry ?
well , if we get stopped will you at least let me say that i commandeered the vehicle , but i let you drive ?
i ' m uncomfortable with that .
you were unhappy ?
i was expelled ! when i was fifteen ?
i might if i saw the case file . you could get that for me .
why don ' t you tell me about `` <person> ? '' you wanted me to find him . or do i have to wait for the lab ?
fifty pounds ? what for ?
<person> offers me a partnership in the chamberlain ' s men . for fifty pounds my hired player days are over .
half my life is over , and i have nothing to show for it . i ' m a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper . i ' m a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage .
<person> ? right there . just what you just said . that ' s beautiful . a thumbprint on a skyscraper . i couldn ' t write that .
meanwhile , he might find it .
i ' m afraid so . i spotted him this time and kicked him out , but he ' s getting trickier all the time .
i ' m fine . it ' s the car my father gave me for graduation that ' s totalled .
<person> . see if you can sober him up .

you know how long i ' ve been looking for those ?
it ' s nothing . it ' s just . i was just thinking . we ' re married now . and i always wanted to try and have kids , and .
so do i . <person> , there ' s nothing more i ' d like to do than have , kids , or .
well , it ' s a candy . and a health food . absolutely . absolutely .

sometimes is still hurts . you know how it is , man . i mean , each day you think about it less and less . and then one day you wake up and you don ' t think of it at all , and you almost miss that feeling . it ' s kinda weird . you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long . and the , boom , something reminds you of her , and you just smile that bittersweet smile .

we have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy . i want proof , not leads !

<person> to this , i love this part --
men never get this movie .
his name is <person> bin <person> . he ' s iraqi . and something of a religious leader .
with something of a devoted following ? . <person> , i can understand why we might not want to publicize the fact that our government ' s in the kidnapping business , but why not tell us ?
well , i guess i wasn ' t paying attention .
five years ago they told me you were dead .
<person> !
oh , are you all right ?
what are you leaning towards ?
<person> . it ' s funnier .

get of me !
what are you talking about - you ' re not a nobody ! that ' s the last thing you are .
<person> , i . i .
you don ' t know that .
<person> ' s say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us , just like we are to , say , medieval europe . suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set . there wouldn ' t be any place to plug it in .
now set your glass down and get some air into it . <continued_utterance> oxygenating it opens it up , unlocks the aroma and the flavors . very important . now we smell again . <continued_utterance> that ' s what you do with every one .
when do we get to drink it ?
i ' ve got two kids to pack for . <continued_utterance> . three including you .
where are they ?
<person> . it ' s perfect . <person> ' t even need a hearing this way . you apprehended the suspect in the commission of a murder . then he turned on you and you fired in self-defense . <continued_utterance> these things are bigger than you - haven ' t you seen that yet ? destiny . justice . <person> . they ' re vast . we ' re just puppets !
i ' m not going to kill you !

<person> , no , hen .
it ' s alright once i ' ve had my porridge , my haggis and a few <person> whiskies- and the monsoon ' s nearly over , so-
go away .
do you want me to call the police ? then tell me why you took him .
but sir , nobody worries about upsetting a droid .
that ' s ' cause droids don ' t pull people ' s arms out of their socket when they lose . wookiees are known to do that .
we are bidding tonight on an <person> .
the nudes ? the bathers ? the dancers ?
about blowing up the white house ?
i was only kidding , ma . besides , what would the president say ?
i ' m happy to tell you that you ' ve been accepted for federal service .
<person> , that ' s great .

fucking men . you don ' t care when i say fuck , do you ?
i keep reading the first line . it ' s a good line , i think . but i don ' t know much about literature .

well , where are you going ?

<person> away from me . get away ! she means that much to you , you stay with her . but you come back , you come back for me . not for <person> , not for your mother , or your fucking job , but for me .
no .
why not ?
and what would that be , sir ?
sulu . when did he find the time for a family ?
there she is .
why is she bringing that bag ?
you vile , ungrateful strumpet -- running away in the night , like a deceitful sneak-thief --
yes -- i ' m running away -- and it ' s all your fault -- you ' re the one who ' s been deceitful and sneaking -- and don ' t think i don ' t know what you intend doing .
nothing ' s wrong with trying to talk to me , <person> .
so what ' s the problem ?
i ' ll give you fifteen minutes grace time .
we ' ll be there . <person> . we love you .
interviews . witnesses . <person> pretty silly , our talking over one another .
<person> . i ' ll handle them from now on .
come . <continued_utterance> bless me , doctor ; and what beams you into this neck of the woods ?
' <person> bearing gifts . ' <person> birthday .
<person> to him , android . such a small and weak creature . yet he roars so valiantly . it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest .
there ' ll be another after me . and another after that . you ' ll find we ' re a resilient species .
i use them for smuggling . i never thought i ' d be smuggling myself in them . this is ridiculous . even if i could take off , i ' d never get past the tractor beam .
leave that to me !
i do not love you , my lord .
how your mind hops about ! your father was a shopkeeper , your children will bear arms , and i will recover my fortune . that is the only matter under discussion today . you will like <person> .

i do not wish to remove the chip , sir . although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with . i can not imagine going back to a life without them . i have taken an important step toward becoming truly human . if i were to turn back now . i would like to continue in my duties , sir .
courage is an emotion too , <person> . now . can you project the course of the ribbon ?
nothing .
are they male or female ?
ladies and gentlemen .
who is that ? where ' s that coming from ?
what is it ?
microcomputer chassis . but i ' ve never seen stuff like this anywhere .
<person> .
you are targeted for termination . the t- <number> will not stop until it complete its mission . ever . <person> mulls that over .
i ' m trying to match the chairs my dad made , but i can ' t get it right .

what ' s that mean ?
people like you --
that ' s where he ' s going .
it should be noted , sir , that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa .
i ' ve always loved this block . <continued_utterance> finding the perfect apartment in new york city is like finding the perfect partner . it can take years .
how many does this make ?
those are not your orders . you are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission .
i didn ' t volunteer for this shit .
me , too , and i don ' t like to count my cornish hens before they hatch , but i do think i ' ll be getting a raise . and i was thinking we could get a place together .
<person> .

you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere , you remember that -- when the sphere opened ? that ' s right . but you can ' t remember going inside , can you ? no , of course not . <person> couldn ' t either , could he ? `` like everything ' s on the tip of my tongue '' , he said .
he ' s <person> , ok ?
well , if he had been italian , they could have been shot off . sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson , if they blow a job or something .
to hell with fate .
<person> again , <person> ?
let me be the judge of that . <continued_utterance> there ' s an amazing thing when a woman has a daughter . one day you look up , and you see . a sister . someone . you can say . anything to . <continued_utterance> i wrote a whole lot of letters . to each of you . and the envelope says when to open it . like , which birthday . or . when you get your driver ' s permit . first time you see rome . things like that . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s for awhile , okay ? until he ' s old enough to not open them all at once .
until he ' s old enough to read . tears on <person> ' s face . her mom wonders .

probably . in my case it ' s probably a whole building .
will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night ?
oh , ' cause the phone doesn ' t ring as much at night and the `` alone '' thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to . but i got the hang of it . you got ta sleep in the middle of the bed . it ' s absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side .

the scimitar will serve my needs .
but surely --
well i want to communicate --
oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they ' d close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i don ' t think you <person> steps closer , speaks quietly to <person> .
maybe . look , this is just something to think about . from what i got at the shopping center , it was more scared than anything else . i don ' t feel it ' s as big a threat as you think it is .
is that what ' s affecting your performance ?
is that why you came up here , <person> ? to thank me ?

we ' re not going to a singing lesson , she ' s just gon na start taking singing lessons .
i know . you ' ll all gladly die to save your home world .
<person> at me , <person> ! do you feel the blood pumping inside you ? your hands , your eyes , your nature , are the same as mine . <person> deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you ' ve forgotten . it ' s the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it ' s the very thing that truly defines us . to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are . <continued_utterance> i know you as well as i know myself , <person> . there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be .
no . i gave up drinking weeks ago . yes . <person> noticed -- which shows i probably conducted myself pretty well as a drunk . but duty called and i ' m sober so may i say just one thing .
one thing . go ahead .
where are you going ?
no , wait . they ' ll hear !
<person> . i went to sell blood yesterday . that ' s how it is . i ' m in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer , and i ' m selling my blood .

it ' ll never be over , will it ? look at me , i ' m shaking . some legend , huh ? you must be pretty disappointed .
they took it apart with a tweezers .

leave him alone , tran .
he ' s no concern of mine , as long as you don ' t talk to him . <person> ' t talk to anybody . you understand ? not with everything that ' s going on right now .
mr . <person> ?
let him be damned for his pages !
i know now why you cry . but it is something i can never do . <person> .
are you afraid ?
<person> . understand . that terminator is out there . it can ' t be reasoned with , it can ' t be bargained with . it doesn ' t feel pity of remorse or fear . and it absolutely will not stop . ever . until you are dead .
can you stop it ?
to accept your surrender . i can clearly destroy you at any time . <person> your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship .
and what of the enterprise ?
how ' d you get your mother to let you go with my mother ?
well , your mother just said she could use my help on a few errands while you ' re in class . <continued_utterance> what ?
what do you mean by ' dirty looks ' ?
well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he ' s starin ' at me with these narrow eyes .
<person> , hot . <continued_utterance> come . counselor .

<number> . what ' s the problem , ma ' am ?
i ' m sick .

three in the morning ? i don ' t think so . i have to go to bed early . i work days . it must have been somebody else .
no . it was you . you had some manila folders and a pink bag from saks .
i had these plans before i met you . but i do like seeing you . i do . i ' m always surprised by it .
what was i thinking ?
we ' ll be pulling in soon . i ' ve got to change trains .
what ' d you say her name was -- your wife ' s ?
i said .
. driving him . ? did you say `` him '' ?
hey , <person> told me he was carrying a wad , but i didn ' t figure this much .
<person> way did he do , <person> ?
there ' s no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot .
what a dirty trick .
<person> yes . i think we ' ll have to give detention to those boys .
forgive me for saying so , <person> , but your methods are too . shall we say . soft ? as head of the pta , i am exercising my right under article <number> of the pta code .
leave the light off . <continued_utterance> i wish you ' d come a little sooner . i might not have had to kill myself . <continued_utterance> you think you ' re dreaming me , like you dream her . understand something : i am the real gibarian . just a new incarnation .
what do you want ?
<person> .
i guess we ' re skipping the tearful reunion . have a seat , <person> .
huh .
now tip it . what you ' re doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim . tells you how old it is , among other things , usually more important with reds . this is a very young wine , so it ' s going to retain its color pretty solidly . now stick your nose in it . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t be shy . get your nose in there . <continued_utterance> what do you smell ?
let me do a gravitational scan . <continued_utterance> there are some inconsistencies here . maybe the planet you ' re looking for was destroyed .
<person> ' t that be on record ?
i hope you ' ve enjoyed being a command program , <person> . i wonder how you ' ll like working in a pocket calculator . maybe one of those watches that plays `` <person> birthday '' to its user once a year .
now , sir . we did take care of that user you sent us --
she did , did she ? how is the old girl ?
definitely old .
she ' s good . got a job at the factory . just part-time , though , so she can keep up with school .
and <person> ?
i am shaking .
you have to do something .
so i ' m a fanatic .
<person> ' s just say you don ' t seem the ambivalent type .
that ' s like about fifteen people .
i don ' t want to know .
<person> ' t be naive . they can ' t kill everybody . they have different punishments for different things . like , if they kill a stool pidgeon , they leave a canary on the body .
why don ' t they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary ?
maybe i was wrong on that one .
well , maybe you weren ' t .
that ' s what scares people . he gets stronger every day . <continued_utterance> i ' ve caught him . sneaking looks at you . at your body .
i know . <continued_utterance> are you afraid of him , <person> ?
what the hell you gon na do when snyder rushes his finger right to lonnegan ? you ' re committin ' suicide , kid .
aw christ , it doesn ' t make no difference now . if snyder knows about it so does everybody else . he never gets anything first . <person> , there ' s no answer at luther ' s .
<person> , sorry , sorry . i know , i ' m late , i ' m a swine .
did you forget where i live ? it ' s four o ' clock .

is there shrimp on it ?
i ' ve just asked him to go and check over the farm -
are you thick ?
no , not actually . our operation is small enough not to be noticed . which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves .
<person> ' t you afraid the empire ' s going to find out about this little operation and shut you down ?
you ' re dead !
am not !
i ' m coming with you .
<person> . i got business to do , theo . i ' ll come back and haunt you later . <person> ' t say i never gave you nothing .

they used to hang people here .
size matters not . <person> at me . judge me by my size , do you ? hm ? mmmm . <continued_utterance> and well you should not . for my ally in the force . and a powerful ally it is . <person> creates it , makes it grow . its energy surrounds us and binds us . luminous beings are we . . not this crude matter . you must feel the force around you . here , between you . me . the tree . the rock . everywhere ! yes , even between this land and that ship !

she works for tips !
you don ' t believe me ?

i could never read that far . i never wanted to .
that far in what , <person> ? <person> doesn ' t say anything . <person> waiting .

how long would you need it for ?
your pad of paper , always alone , and you ' d try to lock in . <person> of sam . <person> . <person> . he might be driving his car , or having a beer or brushing his teeth . or cutting someone ' s eyes out . <continued_utterance> if you did it right , you got all of it : the way it sounded . the way it smelled . those people were looking up at you , begging you for mercy . it was like being god . . except you ' re not . because you can ' t do a thing for them . <person> ' t make it stop . you ' re just watching , helpless . <continued_utterance> they wired us into this current , the five of us : darkness , the pit itself . we were plugged right into it . but nobody taught us how to shut it off . we were just men . and we saw things men shouldn ' t see . <person> , torture , evil - and it never shut off . even now , it ' s still there .
they all wind up like you ? the other agents ?
did the astro-physics journal really accept your paper ?
<person> . well . all i got ' s the data but they ' ve agreed to publish it when it ' s finished . you know . it ' s my calculation on the planetary conjunction .
no , i didn ' t forget sexy .
just didn ' t get around to it , huh ?
what ' s the difference ?
i don ' t know , man . i ' m getting , like , really nervous .
huh . do you think we should have a <person> ' s house on the set for me ?
um .
since <number> . <person> , over <number> years .
in all that time , have you ever had an assistant ?
what ?
there ' s no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot .
come on in , <person> , <continued_utterance> ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos ? that ' s from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week , and no taxes . <person> of these tiles , they ' re slippery .
this is where you live ?
it ' s . against . the . law .
-- just because you went to night school , or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn ' t make you <person> .
and no card-carrying member of the aclu is more deadset against it . than i am . <person> is why i urge you . no , i implore you not to consider this option .
i know what the president will say .
i have lost my gift . it ' s as if my quill is broken . as if the organ of the imagination has dried up . as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed .
interesting .
well , if he had been italian , they could have been shot off . sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson , if they blow a job or something .
as i said , he isn ' t italian . besides , i thought they just killed them .
i needed some time away .
. while she watched the kids . then , you booked this flat in paris for your family ' s summer . but she said .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
<person> , when you meet someone and you ' re attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
let me use your phone .
what ' s up ?
i don ' t know .
i told you what i want .
you ' re a better man than i am , <person> .
no , i just promised myself i ' d give it a try . i got ta get out there sooner or later .
the thing around his neck . <continued_utterance> i told the other guy , i ' ll tell you . i did not do this . <person> . i saw who did this and i can show you what he looks like and you can go catch him .
go ahead and draw the face of the man you saw . <continued_utterance> we ' ll get an artist to help you .
this answers one of our questions .
which one ? let me get the list out .
can i get you a cup of coffee or something ?
i ' ve never seen anyone killed before .
and mine is wearing thin , young man ! we supported you because you promised action . and yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with <person> while --
commander suran , the games are over . in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair .
oh ?
you saved my life .
maybe you and <person> should stay with my mom . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t start . the only reason is that the neighborhood ' s shi . . crummy . i just don ' t like the idea of leaving you alone here at night .
i can still use a gun .

a boy your age should have a girlfriend .
<person> . she has a steady boyfriend .

that ' s true . you grow up here ?
i ' m sorry about <person> , not myself . i ' m even sorry for my brother . to be so lonely , without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she ' s his only real family -
come on now , chickie , why don ' t you go to bed . ?
<person> on . <person> on . <person> ' s not get so dramatic here . what are we four teenagers ? we ' re all sophisticated people . why can ' t we all stay , for the weekend ? your mother ' s got work to do i ' ve got papers to grade . you ' ll do your thing , whatever that is and if we want to hang together , we ' ll hang together . if we don ' t , we don ' t . there ' s no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend .
seriously . i can handle it .
you have to turn yourself in . the boy comaitted suicide . you stole the money . the girl is pressing charges . they ' re going to get you . why not turn yourself in and you can get of f easier . you can strike a bargain . learn when you ' re trapped . you ' re so brilliant . you have such promise . you need help .
would you help me ?
we ' ll work it out .
what ' re they talking about ?
no idea .
well , press something !
you must give me what i want . now . without the deflector dish , we can no longer send for an early invasion . we must assimilate earth ourselves . i need this ship .
yes . but the enterprise . my duty .
the bastard -
meanwhile , hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years younger than him .

err .
she still loves me .
she thinks you ' re a bucket of dog vomit . trust me on this .

maybe .

just like we look forward to this . <continued_utterance> you ' re leaving .
and it was cold and we saw police putting a jacket on a man sitting on a bench .

we ' re the ones have to be awake . to how much we love him . <continued_utterance> and how we should be good to each other . while we have the chance . <continued_utterance> you think ?
no . he won ' t come after me .
why not ?
<person> ? who ?
organized rustling . well at least -- that ' s my belief . <person> was no friend of mine . too fond of taking the law into his own hands . but he had my sympathy . he ' d been harder hit than any of us . and on top of it all , he lost his foreman .
-- she ' s looking for wiring signatures on the device and asking for copies of any latent prints we ' ve managed to lift .
-- <person> ?
ha ! <continued_utterance> your surfer king . we just make a good show . your boy have nothing to worry about .
you know i ' d feel a lot better if you hadn ' t taken most of my money in that poker game last friday night .

when was he . created ?
<person> , i guess .
<person> ' s talk about our project . i ' m so excited about it .
-- no matter how sparkling your record is , no matter how terrified you are to fail -- finally he stops , turns on her:
it ' s . against . the . law .
`` hasta la vista , baby '' ?
yeah , or `` later , dickwad . `` or if someone gets upset you say `` chill out . `` like that . or you can do combinations .
new york .

it is so kind of you to visit our station , <person> . a great honour .
not at all , not at all . i hope you will visit us , commissioner . <continued_utterance> bring the family . it ' s a lot of fun .
and if i could describe it , it probably wouldn ' t be on a radio show . but what the hell . it ' s not one specific thing . it ' s more of a feeling . <continued_utterance> you touch her for the first time , and suddenly . you ' re home . it ' s almost like .
<person> .
seven dollars in any rock and gem shop .
my standard mark-up ' s twenty percent , but we ' re talkin ' about a special object . <person> goes up , price goes up . call it ten bucks even .
yes .
the idea of two people spending their lives together was invented by people who were lucky to make it to thirty without being eaten by dinosaurs . <person> is obsolete .
i trust you of course i do but --
but ? but what ?
i think we ' re in trouble .
if i may say so , sir , i noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged . it ' s impossible to go to light-speed !
is it some sort of joke ? like one of those hoaxes ?
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with <number> tonnes of coral on top of it ? someone went to a lot of trouble . <person> again .
well , i ' m so excited you are here for a sleepover .
we are too . <person> ' t we b-boy ? <continued_utterance> here . <person> has to go to the bathroom .
did you hear what <person> said ? i ' m not a human being . i ' m an instrument . i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what . even if i remain passive . that ' s when i drank the . i was going mad . it felt like there was no body underneath my skin . there was something else . an illusion . but i could feel my heart beating , and i remembered you tested my blood . is it like yours ?

i did a terrible thing , ishmael . i knew what you felt . and what i didn ' t . <continued_utterance> and i never found the courage to tell you .
we watched him cook and chop .
he sort of did wizardry
<person> indeed , for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart .
oh -- i am him too !
my glasses fell apart . i lost the .
. lost the screw .
<person> ? i kinda like it .
do you talk with your mom ?
please . just get off the train .
this isn ' t my stop .
<person> ' t want to believe it . <person> ' t even want to say it out loud . and now i have nowhere to love -- i meant live . i have nowhere to live .
you ' ll stay here .
anything ?
somebody left the unit on . if everyone else was dead , it implies that no one remained to turn it off . those people back there bought escape time for genesis with their lives .
at present he serves no useful function . dr . <person> created us to become active and useful members of society . i do not believe he would have wanted the b- <number> to live out his life in his present state .
i can ' t believe the captain went along with a memory download .
oh come on mum . she ' s just stirring shit . <person> ' s always done that .
why ' s your father on there - and poor <person> ? it ' s so tasteless .
go to impulse . where ' s the borg ship ?
it has entered <person> orbit . correction -- it is not in orbit . it is heading directly toward the surface .
why don ' t we say that more ? it feels good ! i love you more than my brother , man . <person> , when you went away for <person> last year , i , like , missed you . you know ?
i missed you , too . come here , man . <continued_utterance> we ' ll always be friends . `cause we love each other . <continued_utterance> <person> , three weeks ago i was in you room and , like , you were taking a dump and . i saw your residence placement thingy . i totally saw you ' re living with <person> .
<person> and . impervious .

a kid offered me a trade . let me show you .
get out of here -- get off the santee and don ' t ever come back .
mind if i wait for <person> ? he ought to be along any minute -- be funny if he winged that shadow of yours .
when ?
soon . one week . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to transfer you . i know two psychologists that are exceptional --
no , no . a . <number> , it probably got it in the woman ' s house . they were last seen in downtown <person> .
<person> did you let it get into a populated area ?
yes . well .
what ' s wrong ?
tell me . <person> ' t lie , or i ' ll know .
he was a town marshal . one night he surprised two burglars , coming out the back of a drugstore . they shot him .
we would have sooner or later .
oh great ! he tried to kill me ! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you .
it ' s you up on that stage , not him . you don ' t need him .
you have to get out of here . if <person> catches you he ' ll . he ' s acting crazy . he ' s doing way too much playback and he ' s getting completely paranoid . he ' s such a control freak , he ' s even paying <person> to follow me around .
and you know what ?
we , we have to give it .
<person> ? criminal ?
also clean .
<person> ' t he irish ?
actually he was scottish . trust me , i know these things .
then stop trying to memorize it . hit the road .
from vince .

<person> ' t ruin this for me , <person> .
what do you mean ?
is your mind racing ?
i would say my mind has evaporated . but that there are remnants still standing waiting to fall . it feels pretty good .
<person> , that ' s an old klingon ship . what do we know about it ? are there any weaknesses ?
it is a class d-twelve bird of prey . they were retired from service because of defective plasma coils .
i ' m so proud of you ! <person> me love you ! <continued_utterance> so tell me everything . details . i like details .
no .
it put you here . i ' ll admit it , it acted like a god and put you here , put you into my consciousness . i was asleep , and it put you into my dream . i saw your mouth . and there you were . whether you ' ve been sent here to make me happy or punish me , it doesn ' t matter . the decision we make now is all that matters . stay with me .
am i really her ?
hello , mr . <person> . <person>,
<person> a seat .
you see , dallas , a plague on both our houses . we may have to call this game on account of darkness . <continued_utterance> if looks could kill , i ' m dead .
no , i don ' t care about you -- you ' re fantastic . my whole interest , if it ' s not too late , is in <person> . and how to undo what you ' ve done to her .
my neck ' s a little stiff , that ' s all .
that ' s not what i meant .
this is gon na make me puke .
what ?
hey ! you got one , too ! we ' re blood brothers .
shut it , you little shitter ! what the hell were you doing dancing with <person> ?
why are you going to a french restaurant ?
because it ' s quiet . and he wants to talk . <person> -- once he saws you in half , it ' s bedtime .
does he always follow you ?
he ' s not following me -- he ' s with me -- he ' s always with me .
<person> ' s explaining too much . feels expository . needs to be shorthand , like , `` <person> big . ``
<person> ? can we stop for a second ?
<person> , you ' re going to give the boy a complex .
i ' m not kidding . that ' s a huge noggin ' . it has it ' s own weather system . it ' s a virtual planetoid . <person> ! <person> !
<person> upside down ?
a back flip . you guys see it on snowboarders here all the time , i ' m sure .
you should come and hear me .
<person> . i will .
he makes her see her own death , feeds off the reaction . killer and victim merging . orgasm and agony merging . and he records it all .
and gives it to you .
so . i killed <person> . then you ran in , being on his payroll , and shot me .
that ' s pretty much the way it happened .
i ' m quitting real estate .
what are you talking about ? you can ' t quit real estate . you ' re gon na be great at real estate . you got the whole look and besides , that ' s where everything ' s headed . <person> , it ' s what i should have done forty years ago .
then have the lab check <person> ' s head . dr . <person> ' s patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues . they ' ll find another cocoon .
you seem pretty sure of that .
it don ' t look good , gramps , it ' s ten of now .
i got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me .
the answer is <person> .
<person> , that ' s a good one .
you ' re right . i better use two .
there ' s lots of ' em , <person> , look .
i think so .
you get to travel around and stuff ? i mean , better places then this ?
what do you imagine this is ?
port thrusters , sir . would you like me to drive ?
what ? are you fucking spying on me ?
lock the fucking door , <person> .
<person> , you can tell the computer to override the security system .
attention ! this is <person> . the empire has takes control of the city . i advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive . <continued_utterance> this way .
not in those exact words - you know what a temper he ' s got .
when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road ?
-- but first , you helped them .
what do you mean -- ?
<person> ! it ' s <person> !
nice try .
hi . how you doing ? you ' re a lucky guy .
thanks . i ' ll wait for you at the car . nice to meet you , <person> .
. you know , and i know , that the only thing standing between a life sentence for <person> and his freedom is my testimony at his trial .
<person> .
the one where you go to the slave market . you can cut right to the scene where <person> the baptist -
<person> away from me ?
i was at this party once . i ' m on a couch with <person> . she was just sitting there , looking beautiful and staring at me . i go to lean in and kiss her and i realize i have gum in my mouth . i turn and take out the gum . stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around . <person> throws up all over herself . i knew the second it happened . it was a miracle . i could have been kissing her when she threw up . that would have scarred me for life . i may never have recovered . <continued_utterance> i ' m a miracle man . those lights are a miracle .
there you go .
why not ? they seem to have a box of old coverings here .
oh ? how observant of you , <person> . of course , i ' m just not mechanically minded . if you see what i mean .
no . i don ' t think so .
well , think . because there ' s footprints here that aren ' t mine .
but how am i to know the good side from the bad ?
you will know . when you are calm , at peace . passive . a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense , never for attack .
sure , <person> .
oh , you make it so difficult sometimes .
who ?
i don ' t know ! someone . <continued_utterance> this is my room . you can sleep here .

<person> ' t ruin this for me , <person> .
oh yeah .
the rest of you are graduated . you can go home today . the kids cheer .

<person> sure you can ' t imagine it , cause , if you can , it ' s just one step to doing it . <continued_utterance> . they ' ll be back where they came from by morning , and all this is just a bad dream .
what is this ? who authorized this ?
we don ' t know , sir . but <person> is up and running again .
<person> and a cop ? that would happen .
we were working a scene today where this guy offs himself in a sporting goods store . so they had this cleaning crew out there , right ? you would not believe how much money they charge for that shit .
i don ' t believe it .
i know . i know you ' re the strongest cop in town .

i don ' t know , but everything in my being tells me he was behind it .
<person> newberry .
<person> , it ' s <person> . i ' m at the van buren . x intercut their phone conversation .
then i ' m going home to get some things .
i ' ll have somebody drive you .

your sex life ?
history repeats itself . everything that happened to <person> . began with a smear like this .
yes .

bases <person> . there ' s a <number> o-page outline .
. which also is the secret to .
french toast !
but she could still be around ! hiding or something . i mean , she could have actually been here when you saw her !
if she was , she ' s very quick getting in and out of a room .
there ' s just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude !
hull integrity failing .
does it work ?
how would i know ?
<person> ' t crank the gain any more .
i need to see more . get more detail . something . i feel his presence , so strong .
no . you ate yours .
send that through . <continued_utterance> oh , <person> . do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool ?
i do have another apartment that ' s not even on the market yet . <person> to take a look ?
sure .
what ' re you going to do ? <continued_utterance> you can ' t just . kill him .
i ' m not . just a little poach job .
looking ?
just looking . after i saw <person> ' s face at the rehearsal dinner , i could never -- - <continued_utterance> but you should see this guy . every night sex with a different partner . he ' s like -- -- me . five years ago .
why would you park in the staff-
<person> up , <person> .

<person> , you ' re gon na make me cry .

meaning ?
well , you sure as hell don ' t want to get involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing . my advice would be to . `` avoid paperwork . ``
eliminate them , you mean .
you kiddin ' ? after the holidays , we ' ll have to stretch it . <continued_utterance> not used to a woman . giving me presents . <continued_utterance> she raises a brow . can scarcely believe that . <continued_utterance> one <person> with <person> , i gave her eleven things . and i wrapped them . and watched her open them up . <continued_utterance> she didn ' t have anything for me . like every year . but this one time , she said , ' wait a minute . ' wait a minute . <continued_utterance> she ran to the kitchen . i heard the fridge open . she came back . with her hands hidden behind her . then , she held out . <continued_utterance> two brown eggs . she gave them to me from her own hands . they were cold . <continued_utterance> must sound really stupid . but they meant a lot to me .
well . it ' s the thought that counts .

yes !
and <person> , too ?
<person> , you ' re talking about three guys over a seven year span . that ' s hardly news . no deaths . elopement in this state , as of this day , is still not illegal .

the day my <person> died . the truth exploded out of me like a vision . my <person> and <person> had been arguing , there was a gunshot and my father was dead .
you are very intense , you know that ?
it was dead . we had it tested . maybe the d- <number> was the spare and he had to use it .
maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit . so he ' d have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in ? <continued_utterance> <person> , how many batteries and what size did you find on <continued_utterance> no spare .
and i ' ll plead guilty and go to prison and serve a few months .
a few months tops .

and i find - you know - as a professional writer- it ' s best to just , you know , stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed . and in the morning .
thank you , <person> . do you have any idea who was behind the attack ?
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners , on the moons of naboo .
it ' s more than that -- lately , i haven ' t been feeling a connection to --

<person> . this is great . the whole town knows . just out of curiosity , how do you two know ?
grace heard it .
not exactly . it exists in a continuum that wasn ' t proven until ten years ago , a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe . an infinite number of them , in fact . it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe , space , or space-time . it was completely counter-intuitive . we had to unlearn everything .
is it intelligent ?
exactly . or she would be jealous . and when she gets jealous , we both know what she ' s capable of .
no , we don ' t . you do , like i said , i just met her .
you just kept the penny in that hand the whole time .
who me ?
<person> , dude , i wan na be just like terrance and <person> !
hey wait a minute . where ' s your guardian ?

i don ' t know . senior editor ? sounds like you ' re in to me .
trials aren ' t only about truth , mr . <person> . even though they should be . they ' re about what people <continued_utterance> we were afraid . <person> seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake .
well , it seems to me . nels objection . mr . <person> can give his view in his summation . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t it seem to <continued_utterance> i suppose that you mean this
i feel as if you haven ' t heard anything i ' ve been saying to you .
i don ' t believe you .
but the toughest scenario . is the one hooks will never raise .
and what ' s that ?
not time for what ?
<person> , you didn ' t do anything embarrassing or anything .
tell me about the door . do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ? . <person> ?
you don ' t understand about the sphere .
i ' m sorry .
i ' m not saying it ' s your fault .
so they tell the kid to throw the world series , or else , huh ?
more or less . only for the end i ' ve got a gimmick that ' s real good .
second question . what did <person> pay you per acre ?
a thousand .
you ' re not mclovin . no one ' s mclovin and this is never going to work . we need a new way to get alcohol . could we drive to canada or something ?
i still think it ' s going to work .
you know , i think that <person> <number> unit we bought might have been stolen .
what makes you think that ?
well . how ' d you do ?
mmmm . i told her how beautiful the california sunsets are .
after we id , we bury the body . <person> and casket closed .

oh yes . yes , it ' s astonishingly beautiful . all of it .
this is from all of us .

`` eating at this perfect smaller , passionate restaurant inspires one ' s own abandonment of caution . to wit : <person> is the best chef in the united states . ``

what ' d he pull ?
well , anyway , <person> ' s is where they are .
thanks .
hi .
hi .
right . the report . report and recommend . <continued_utterance> what does <person> think you should do ?
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t leave until we figure out a way to document it , to prove its existence to the planet earth . this is hilarious : he thinks it ' s god , but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home .
<person> shoes . entertainment law , would be my guess . <person> . i just like to guess , is all . it ' s my job to know people and what they want . what ' s behind their eyes .
<person> gives people their heart ' s desire . <person> ' t that right , <person> ?
why ?
my husband feels you betrayed him .
i have to say that we expected more from you .
stop ! stop reading from your goddamn script !
i ' m leaving .
what do you mean ?
there wasn ' t any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and didn ' t leave no footprints in the hall .
<person> , and what does <person> say about that ?
i don ' t recall inviting you .
i overhead what you told <person> . the lie .
we also have a canadian spy who was hiding out in south park ! !
ike ? ! <person> ' s mother rushes over to general plymkin . <continued_utterance> general . these are our children !
stay there , my man .
<person> ' t hurt me .
he is .
oh . i needed that . thank you . <continued_utterance> so what are you guys up to tonight ?
your father should keep you better informed . he has bought me for you . he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday . you are allowed to show your pleasure .
i do not love you , my lord .
<person> , there ' s nothing there .
there is . they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses .
which one of those women is in charge here ?
neither of ' em . they ' re just moms .
and people say i ' m crazy .
i assure you , <person> , that after today . no one will ever call you that again .
no . not officially . i dated a guy for a while who ran a studio .
oh , the martial arts expert . the north-south guy . here in san francisco ?
and these blast points , too accurate for <person> . only imperial stormtroopers are so precise .
why would imperial troops want to slaughter <person> ? <continued_utterance> if they traced the robots here , they may have learned who they sold them to . and that would lead them home !
me ?
my ankle . just go explain the situation .
information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
<person> again ! and get out of here .
it just slipped out .
it happens .
yes , greedo . as a matter of fact , i was just going to see your boss . tell <person> that i ' ve got his money .
it ' s too late . you should have paid him when you had the chance . <person> ' s put a price on your head , so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you . i ' m lucky i found you first .
anything else ?
a phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range .
but my aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him , and now wants me to place all my affairs in the judge ' s hands and return east . such is certainly not my wish .
looks kinda like she ' s formed an attachment . <continued_utterance> for the locality , i mean .
oh ! the evening before , i see .
yes , dr . <person> was absolutely clear about this : politics and art must be kept separate .
i draw people with smiles , dogs running , and rainbows . they don ' t have meetings about rainbows .
i guess they don ' t .
i want to do everything . i got a theory you ' re supposed to do everything before you die . have you ever driven a car , blindfolded , at a hundred and fifty miles an hour ?
not lately .
i ' m the greatest star of them all .
<person> . norma .
i ' m saying they might shoot us on sight . you have to remember . these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them .
there must be some good people .
any thoughts for today ' s rehearsal ?
i have a new title , maybe .
look , i met somebody . she ' s good , and capable and smart . we hit it off . we can ' t spend your life chasing after fantasies .
hi .
your kids never cry .
well , maybe that ' s because they know i ' m going to follow them . behind the bus .
they must never again leave this city .
that was never a condition of our agreement , nor was giving <person> to this bounty hunter !
that ' s where it gets a little strange .
and what about the guy that was following me ?
as i remember , thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its bioqenic properties .
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level . i can ' t overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation , <person> . a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds .
the propecy is coming true , the dark side is growing .
and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future . only going through the dark side can we see .
he called you at home ?
yes .
we ' ll be there in half an hour .
i ' ll give you fifteen minutes grace time .
any communication at all ?
nope . it ' s weird they ' re just in there .
uh huh , i wan na hear this part .
<person> , take some executive . bored with his life , bored with his wife . he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar . then he goes around for months , torn up worrying that he ' s got aids , that he ' ll infect his wife . and maybe he really does catch something --
then . when did she get better ?
she didn ' t .
to the yankees ?
no . our team cut him loose . he ' s got a cousin there . i don ' t know what he ' s going to do .
hi . this is <person> . leave a message .
<number> - <number> - <number> . that ' s all . i just wanted to leave my number . i don ' t want you to think i ' m weird , or desperate or something . . i mean , you know , we should just hang out . that ' s it . no expectations . just , you know , hang out . bye . he hangs up . <person> .
french toast .
no eggs ? you sure ?
yeah . hi .
i called yesterday but you were out .
i wouldn ' t say encouraged .
well , he didn ' t say ' no ' , did he ?
<person> , everybody , let ' s quiet down for a minute . for those who don ' t know me , my name is <person> , and i . sort of run things around here .
big mike ! big mike ! big mike !
i - ran away .
why , <person> ? did the rancher fuck you ?
he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there . it would kind of save us a honeymoon .
why don ' t you ? we can finish the script by thursday . <continued_utterance> stop crying . you ' re getting married . that ' s what you ' ve always wanted .
no . i am not .
then why the hell you looking at me ?
all right , we ' ll do the job with auxiliary power .
could you use another hand , admiral ?
and we met this guy and started singing and talking .
i was hallucinating from not eating-
she smiled baby .
that ' s not cool .
<person> ! you think we ' ll get there by midnight ?
<person> , we ' re gon na be up by five hundy by midnight . <person> , baby !

you don ' t believe me ? look in the garage .
<person> ' t know how i could help her -- even if i wanted to -- i don ' t know any thing about this <person> -- or <person> -- or --
well , now -- i could mebbe help you out some , there -- fact , i could tell you somethin ' ' bout ole <person> that might be interestin ' .
i called yesterday but you were out .
when ?
breaking and entering .
breaking and entering ?
that was really stupid .
i think i broke my hand .
kulok .
he really was fbi .
she ' s got nothing to do with this . let her go .
<person> , right to the cops . no way .
is there a terrorist cell operating in this city that we are unaware of ?
such a tragedy . growing up in that city was . paradise . like an exotic paris , wasn ' t it , frank -- ?
he ' s going to kill her , mr . <person> . this morning , or maybe at noon , but today , and belvedere ' s our last chance . i ' m flying there , right now , unless you stop me . you want my id ? <person> - take it .
there ' s about $ <number> here . and a hotline code number . they ' ll patch you through to me , wherever i am .
<person> . it was magic .
<person> .
he took stuff from you ?
besides the address book ? he took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer . and my skis . and my tv .
but <person> i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . <person> love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?
when the queen commands it .
the emperor commands you make contact with him .
move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission .
she smelled like soup .
what does that mean ?
and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the federation . i can ' t let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions .
all i have is my personal feelings . i wasn ' t raised with the ideals of the federation . but i ' m trying to understand them now . to live up to them to live up to you . <continued_utterance> i want to know where i come from . the remans gave me a future . you can tell me about my past .
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven .
oh . where is this place ?
i don ' t believe this bullshit ! i can ' t . this isn ' t happening ! i didn ' t even know you could get arrested for this shit ! we need that fucking liquor !
oh my god . are they gon na take him downtown ?
that ' s what <person> ' s doing . he ' s changing its course . but why ? why try to alter its path . why not simply fly into it with a ship ?
our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged .
par for the course . you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner ?
maybe .
time ' s up ! what is it ? ! what is the next attack ! so help me , i ' ll put this bullet through your brain .
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about !

marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind .
but they ' re going to kill her !
my god , what ' s going on in our school ? first professor octavius almost blows up the physics lab . now this . you report it in triplicate , of course .
<person> , be careful when you talk to octavius . remember . the man is a very fragile genius . one day he ' ll bring us all the noble prize .
how are you getting to the airport ? you need money for the bus ? <continued_utterance> there ' s a u . s . <person> car outside , norman .

how ya doin ' see . how come everyone knows me by sight now ?
ah , you ' re the next big thing . you ' ll survive it . the employee olympics are only a week away . what happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we ' re judged on our spirit . then different teams compete in contests that test their water world skills . the next morning it all ends with the surf contest . you ready ?
we can ' t let you do that .
i don ' t want to hurt anybody . i just want to go home .
right .
so what ' s the difference ?
what if the defendant follows <person> .
<person> !
i have two pieces of good news .
and i have two coffees .
hello . <person> to intrude .
hey , <person> .
whatever you do , however terrible , however hurtful - it all makes sense , doesn ' t it ? inside your head . you never meet anybody who thinks they ' re a bad person or that they ' re cruel .
but you ' re still tormented , you must be , you ' ve killed somebody .
<person> , no one wants to talk shop . especially butcher shop .
come here .
who exactly is `` we '' on this particular team , <person> ?
it ' s never the question that ' s indiscreet , only the answer .
where ' s my father ? where ' s my father ? johnny looks around urgently .
<person> , get over under that table with <person> and <person> and the others . <person> , you better go on down the root cellar with <person> and help with the ones down there .
yeah . why ?
nothing .

or shall i call my servant ?
<person> , heal thyself .
that ' s all you have to say ?
<person> ?
shut down the source code . <person> now . <continued_utterance> fine . i ' ll do it myself .
we will . something ' s wrong here . she ' s helping him now .
i know . she bought him a ticket for <person> and put him on the bus . he didn ' t stay on though and they drove off together .
you were thinking shots ?
sure .
what is it ?
bedrock ! i can not dig any further in zis direction !
what ' s the next attack ? who else are you going to kill today , huh ?
oh <person> . oh <person> .
i don ' t know why you should be so upset . stop that playing , <person> . it seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together .
<person> , i ' m supposed to fix up your script . there ' s nothing in the deal about my staying here .
well , there ' s a pirate in truth , i have not written a word .
<person> is italian . always in and out of love .
<person> , don ' t .
from the moment i met you , all those years ago , a day hasn ' t gone by when i haven ' t thought of you . and now that i ' m close to you again , i ' m in agony . the closer i get to you , the worse it gets . the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry . i feel dizzy . i can ' t breathe . i ' m haunted by the kiss you should never have given me . my heart is beating , hoping that kiss will not become a scar . you are in my very soul , tormenting me . what can i do ? i will do anything you ask . <continued_utterance> if you are suffering as much as i am , tell me .
no , really . when i started my training , i was very homesick and very lonely . this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about . the problem was , the more i thought about my mom , the worse i felt . but i would feel better if i thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers .
. and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls . the first time i saw the capital , i was very young . i ' d never seen a waterfall before . i though they were so beautiful . i never dreamed one day i ' d live in the palace .
can ' t you listen to me ? <person> ' t you want to get out of here ?
why should i want to get out of here ? this is where i live .
take it easy ! i set her up . i saw it coming .
it ' s not your fault . <person> , please get off the case .
what do you mean ?
these are not the kind of movies i go to .
no ! that was the last thing i thought of . my dream was to help in the `` <person> . `` i never thought of running for elected office . but the more history i studied , the more i realised how much good politicians could do . so when i was eight , i joined the `` apprentice legislators '' , then later on became a senatorial advisor , with such a passion that , before i knew it , i was elected <person> . <person> because i scored so high on my education certificate , but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible . i wasn ' t the youngest <person> ever elected , but now that i think back on it , i ' m not sure i was old enough . i ' m not sure i was ready .
the people you served thought you did a good job . i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office .
they don ' t know they ' re dead ?
i see ghosts . <continued_utterance> they tell me stories . things that happened to them . things that happened to people they know .
looks all right . it ' s big enough and off the street .
i don ' t know . this is kinda short notice . i ' m not sure we can get it all done by saturday .
-- if you ' re on the state department terrorist watch list you can not get into this country . but <person> was on the watch list , and he got in .

i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles .

yeah , for one second . that was the blend -- you ' ve got to listen to each other . be a group .
i knew that .
<person> , um , my dad ' s a butcher , do you need a hand ?
well , actually , yes . <continued_utterance> can you get me four belgian porterhouses ? do you know what a porterhouse looks like ?

leaving any minute . <continued_utterance> <person> -- seventeen-fifty -- name ?
suit up , fellas . time to go build another play house .
<person> .
where i would sit on his feet and he ' d fly me through the air . i hit my head on the ceiling and i blacked out . <continued_utterance> i was knocked out for <number> - <number> minutes .
oh .

nothing . <person> , i want to talk to you about . well . <person> said to ask you . <continued_utterance> see , the place where i can connect with <person> is my photography . because she loves video and all . <continued_utterance> she ' s been talking about this little editing machine , it ' s only .
so baby , you ' re rich . .
well , my mother is , sort of . not really .
me neither . <person> does <person> . all only children - what does that mean ?

' and <person> said , ' oh , not these people , major . these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics . ' you get the point , <person> ? the point is they ' re all full of shit .
<person> ' s in a different category .
perhaps you didn ' t mention them because there ' s only one conclusion to be drawn . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to take <person> for a little walk , <person> . mr maccarron wants to talk with you .
we could go down to the bar - no need for you to -
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
it ' s new -- have you any idea what you ' re saying ?
<person> know the right thing to do . he ' s a good boy .
so how about this ? he tells me i ' ve got to cover for him if his mother calls . he told her he ' s spending the night at my house .

i ' ll leave you guys alone . have a great time .
i ' m naked , aren ' t i ?
<person> , it ' s just that .

how many times i got ta ask <person> to fix that ? he said he fixed this place up , so how come the roof leaks every time it rains ?
really smelly job where the lady had died and they didn ' t find her for a while and it was really .

and inexperienced .
and young people must be protected from themselves at times -- don ' t you agree ? <person> throws him a quick look , which he returns steadily .

we want to talk to ya about <person> .
but outside , it ' s living human tissue . <person> , skin , hair . blood . <person> for the cyborgs .
<person> , reese , i know you want to help , but .
hey , i ' m missing the party !

she didn ' t like me , anyway .
she thought you were money .
and <person> was followed in office by .
i ' m just drawing blanks . i ' m embarrassed . it ' s my own fault i spent my time on math , which i ' m lucky if i don ' t flunk anyway and .

i pretty much raised her . you know the scene . depressed mother . withdrawn father . my dad was a photographer too .

you told me to .
you know how subversive she is . she once sent me a valentine from prince <person> - and i believed it . it ' s her sense of humour ; she likes causing trouble . at school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift .
she taught you to shoplift ?

and why not ?
because . there was no way to win .
<person> . you fixed us all pretty good , didn ' t you ? my friend !
stop ! i ' ve done all i can . i ' m sorry i couldn ' t do better , but i have my own problems .
yeah .
i ' ve had a hard on almost all day and it won ' t go away . like i ' m riding on the back seat of a bus with bad shocks and every other passenger is a gorgeous woman with a yellow sports top whose leaning over . it ' s like every dream i ever had and some even i didn ' t have the balls to dream .

patterns , repetition of behavior .
<person> said <person> was trying to get back to the ribbon . if that ' s true , then there must be some connection with the amargosa star .
the star ' s destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector . however , none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon .

hello ?
hello , mom ?
yes .
it ' s just as if i ' ve seen a ghost today .
i ' m not under your command , general .

oh , <person> , not you , too . what i want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue , right after she had the line , ' i can ' t cry for you willy . ' ?
she felt very strongly that it was right .
she ' s like a goddamn poster child for high school .

<person> , lady -- i ' d rather walk for somebody else , than ride for you .
well -- the impudence --
can i piss in your sink ?
um , yeah , i guess .
as happens so frequently here on romulus , a new government came to power . they decided to abandon the plan -- frankly , i think they were afraid i ' d be discovered and it would lead to war . they weren ' t ready for that . <continued_utterance> romulan ale -- i ' m surprised . i can ' t stand it .
you ' ll acquire a taste for it .
not a live cow . a whole butchered cow from a rancher . on the hoof they call it .
mm hmm .
you ' re lying . i don ' t believe it .
what do your senses tell you ?
the unlicensed boxer ? you know something i don ' t ?

<person> good , busyboy .
what do your senses tell you ?
where am i , right now , as we speak ?

what you promised - do it ! <person> ' t finagle around . it ' s later than you think .
the live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide . if you do not hit your target , it will shoot you . <person> blackened automated target drones fitted with pulse guns <continued_utterance> the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury , but if you are hit , you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly . <person> , has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
sir , yes , sir !
doggy .
notice that nothing happens . <person> say ' <person> . '

<person> . how did you like it ?
how come she ' s with a different bloke every week and when <person> ' s sister shagged <person> - just once , after he lied he loved her - she gets called a dirty slag .
that ' s cos she does it in five star resorts around the world - and not the feathers carpark . <continued_utterance> it ' s <person> !
it is bailing , if you promised to burn your dick off !

well , it ' s the same woman . and he was crazy about her . what is this ? this is from seattle . she opens the letter . reads it . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
so i mailed your letter .

well . where it came from .
that ' s fine . i want you to be absolutely truthful . and i ' ll be right there to advise and help you . and there ' ll be a court stenographer there to make a record of it , and <continued_utterance> that ' s what ' ll go to the judge , before the trial is set . it ' ll be the same for everybody . they ' ll be deposing the ottos and the walkers , the bus driver .
dolores .

and you know what happens when people assume . they make an ass out of who ?
he ' s no concern of mine , as long as you don ' t talk to him . <person> ' t talk to anybody . you understand ? not with everything that ' s going on right now .
you ' re too goddamned paranoid .

what ?
are you done yet ?
i ' m just starting something .
did you ?
what ' s the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ?
it wasn ' t ?
no one has any clue where <person> is . that son of a bitch might fixate on you . please watch your back , <person> .
i ' m so excited !
here it is . <continued_utterance> well . that was the exact reaction i was aiming for .
what ?
that ! now stop it ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! !

so that ' s nice . least someone does .
i know , but . <continued_utterance> you married , <person> ?
twenty-eight years .
i just . like i always wanted to meet you . just once . just to tell you stuff .
what stuff ?
we both go outside and move around the house in opposite directions . we act crazy , insane with anger . make him crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other side .
<person> , act crazy ?
over there !
<person> ! everybody ! <person> <number> . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
what ' s the matter with you ?
what right do you have to take me for granted ?
this is <person> white .
how can i thank you ? how can i repay you for this part ? it ' s a . what a , thank you for this part . the first scene at the old mill .
what ' s going on ?
our position is correct , except . no , <person> !
we hire a lot of moonlighters here .
so i hear .
i ' m making something happen !
you gone too far !
<person> , weird . but great .
<person> . definitely .
what ? why ?
she can ' t because of her daughter .
he ' s got a proposition to make -- about riding for him . sixty a month .
<person> -- that ' s a foreman ' s wages .
it ' s going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship .
what programs were accessed ?
why the fuck do i want a caravan that ' s got no fuckin wheels ? i am not going to do that . <continued_utterance> where the fuck do you think you ' re going ? you want to settle this with a fight ?
you ' ll do no such thing <person> .
are you . <person> skywalker ? have you been checked out on the incom t-sixty- five ?

for what ?
interviews . witnesses . <person> pretty silly , our talking over one another .
putting your life on the line .
you don ' t think of it like that . i wish you ' d come visit .
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back . <person> , you can ' t do anything to make her want to come back . you can only do things to make her not want to come back .
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her .
<person> .
<person> , you ' re all a bunch of ass ramming unclefuckers .
this shall be your cell , <person> .
my what ?
thanks , <person> .
<person> ' you always have to dress like a fuckin ' pimp ?

an eight .
looks like we ' re in a dead heat after one hole . this is turning into quite a rivalry .
everyone is so proud , <person> . it ' s all we can talk about .
did you get the money ?
you can ' t be an ' us ' just when you want to . you can ' t play that card when it ' s convenient .
we .
you do ?
oh , yeah , so bad .
the detail agent . was he fucking her ?
the girl ?
i wish i could help in some way , <person> .
help me with two minutes of silence ! <continued_utterance> go home , <person> . it ' s late .
first off , if there ' s one , there ' s more . that ' s how it is , soldiers travel in bunches . second , they don ' t waste soldiers on folks like us , that ' s for police ! training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call `` cost effective . ``
then who do they fight ?
well , we ' re in pursuit of a green <person> .
it ' s in a green <person> ?
when i woke up , nobody was here .
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me .
ah .
ah .
not worth stealing . only thing in town worth something . <person> glass window .
ever wonder why the dalmatian ' s the symbol of the firehouse ?
we don ' t know , sir . but <person> is up and running again .
where ' s <person> ?
even tho . she never loved you .
<person> . because of it . <continued_utterance> see , love . <person> ' t about what ' s good for you . <person> ' t about what you wish it was . <person> ' t about what . would make you happy . <continued_utterance> love . is about want . what you really want . and you can ' t change that . even if it ' s poison . <continued_utterance> so that ' s why it ' s great . to have a real friend . when you ' re . lonely .
i didn ' t even like her , to be honest .
she was hot .
<person> . data-base hoods . it ' s a wonderful world . <person> daughter missing . <person> of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . please find our adored angel , we miss her so . dead or alive .
<person> is getting desperate . where is she , <person> ? where ' d you stash her ?
<person> ' s make it more difficult . <continued_utterance> <person> six-oh-seven !
<person> !
no , no , look , there was this radioactive experiment . i was poisoned !
you were what ?
you ' ve already been told what you need to know . discipline your memory . limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you . everything else is irrelevant .
irrelevant ? killing me each time is irrelevant ?
that ' s so great .
<person> , it worked out really well .
well , funny thing about my back . it ' s located on my cock . <continued_utterance> ha ! <person> , sure . i can do that . what do you guys want ?
well , this is actually , like , a big favor , but , well , my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week , but the house if full of food , so i figure i should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party .
that ' s impossible- .
why ?
<person> clarence ! sister !
it ' s no use . she just isn ' t here .
<person> kissing . kissing off .
<person> ' t look that way - you know - from a distance .
. nah . i ' m right across the street .
. which one . ?
say what ?
anything out of the ordinary ?
i slapped <person> ' s clean hand .
no !
were the two of you . involved ?
no . not like you and <person> used to be .
why do you go then ?
i ' m not sure i can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class . in this case math . and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you ' ve learned math -- so they make you go to summer school . it helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission .
i guess i didn ' t realize how big i was until i saw it on your faces .
how -- and i say this with love -- how could you not realize it ?
show you ?
yeah , show me , i want to see you do it . pretend i ' m <person> . you ' re the maestro , and you have the baton in your right hand , but you give me the salute just the same .
where ' s the grey suitcase ?
what ? i can ' t hear you babe .
<person> ' t you ever just want to die ?
not while i ' m still a virgin .
see <person> , <person> ' s truck swerved off the road and ah . hit <person> and then a tree . she was pinned between the two .
<person> ? what does that mean ?
or shall i call my servant ?
i know your face . you ' re <person> desmond . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big .
oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they ' d close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i don ' t think you <person> steps closer , speaks quietly to <person> .
<person> . my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again .
such as ?
<person> and . impervious .
because it had to look random . not connected to anything or anyone . but then why give the rape to me ?
that ' s where it gets a little strange .
what do you mean -- your murder , <person> ?
well , he ' d read about me in the paper . he knew about <person> -- and about you . he suggested that if he got rid of <person> for me , i should kill his father .
no . a little sugar though .
we ' ve only got honey .
you put explosives around the habitat , i can ' t imagine what you ' d put in a drink .
i did do that , didn ' t i ?
you don ' t sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure .
i am . really . it was awesome .
flip six , three hole . <person> ? hey !
what ?
who is it ?
it ' s <person> . let me in . <continued_utterance> <person> , come on , it ' s me .
a deal ? you wan na make a deal with the devil . well sure , deals are mounds o ' fun .
<person> , would you let me do my job please !
he thinks you ' re a very suspicious character . he doesn ' t trust anybody ! not even himself . <person> is eager to get out of the room , and <person> is maddeningly slow in his movements .
come on . <person> ' t forget your sleeping bag .
no , sir , it is not possible . the b- <number> is physically identical to me , although his neural pathways are not as advanced . but even if they were , he would not be me .
how can you be sure ?
mate , last time you drank a bottle of whisky you pissed on my leg .
bollocks !
since our divorce <person> has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids , he ' s now living with a woman half his age --
<person> ' s not half my age .
<person> , a <person> burger . the <person> ' s favorite lunch . <person> reaches for the plate . <person> walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from <person> .
<person> away from that burger .
two deposits , <person> and new england first . <person> drop , like always .
get my stuff down t ' laundry . two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot . tell ' em if they over- starch my shirts again , they ' re gon na hear about it from me . how do i look ?
i don ' t know ; the ugly one .
<person> ?
affirmative , sir . negative , sir . they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals .
well then . only one way to go .
no drinking . no cervezas in the casa .
i already told him that one .
<person> ? he only wants to talk to you ! page <number> .
<person> ?
her legs are in the way .
you got her ? <continued_utterance> get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . <person> ?
<person> ! what ' s up , man ?
oh . you know .
a benefit for some disease or school -- -
surely they can ' t make the movie of cats .
but i said yes .
no dogs , no way and that ' s final .
do we ? have him ?
to refresh your memory , as i told you last time , it was the libyans who --
i don ' t want a science lecture . you were on that observatory looking for trilithium . why ?
i was ordered to by the captain .
i do not like this idea of hiding .
<person> ' t worry . now that the council has ordered an investigation , it won ' t take <person>aster obi-wan long to find that bounty hunter .
you want me to say that .
i want you . to tell the truth .
the blue or the flowery ?
the blue .
starling -
but then he had to cover up , make her seem just like all the rest of them . that ' s what <person> was hinting !
no . precisely . we begin by coveting what we see every day . <person> ' t you feel eyes moving over your body , <person> ? i hardly see how you couldn ' t . and don ' t your eyes move over the things you want ?
all right , then tell me how -
no problem . i want to help .
well , thank you , <person> .
that ' s why you didn ' t want to take the mill out . you ' ve .
. the , the , the symbol of the fire .
i don ' t have to listen to you ! you ' re not my mother .
<person> for that ! <continued_utterance> what i meant and perhaps i didn ' t say it well was you have a great mom . you don ' t need another one . but when you ' re at this house --
crap . <continued_utterance> did you ever got ahold of maya yesterday ?
nope .
<person> ' s hateable . i never thought of that .
i hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up .
we could lend it to him for a week .
we can ' t . if something happens -
is sex the only thing that matters to you ?
i love you . <person> sits with his arms crossed and a frown . <continued_utterance> you know i do .
his children formed a corporation , i take ten percent . i ' m not a buccaneer , <person> . <continued_utterance> what ?
i don ' t think i ' ve ever met anyone quite like you .
what ' re you --
i can ' t get a read on this guy .
<person> . <person> ?
that ' s right .
you know what you remind me of ?
what ?
betty , there ' s no use running out on it . <person> ' s face it , what- ever it is .
it ' s nothing . i got a telegram from <person> .
they said i was dogged ?
well , they say here that when you went on a case , you stayed on it . now we can ' t take every nazi in this country to trial , although i would like to ; it ' s an impossibility . so we ' re going for the big boys in industry , education , law , culture .
boris the blade ? i heard of him , isn ' t he supposed to be a short little fucker that ' s covered in scars ?
sneaky little shit one of the russian dissidents , killed more men than , . well he ' s-killed a lot of men . deals in arms , that he gets off some of the old school .
think you can trust me ?
the last time i seen <person> was the day he died -- in the pause <person> remains silent . <continued_utterance> -- ' twas in town -- he jus ' come out of the stage office . <person> to book passage to <person> but couldn ' t on account i had a full load . -- well , sir , he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says , `` read it . `` i looked it over and fer as i could see it was a paper from one of them chicago sportin ' firms , tellin ' how to manipulate trick playin ' cards .

i played piano in a few places .

<person> what a fraud he was . <continued_utterance> no , but i do like to think about the life of wine , how it ' s a living thing . i like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing , how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained . what the weather was like . i think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes , and if it ' s an old wine , how many of them must be dead by now . i love how wine continues to evolve , how every time i open a bottle it ' s going to taste different than if i had opened it on any other day . because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it ' s constantly evolving and gaining complexity . that is , until it peaks -- like your ' <number> -- and begins its steady , inevitable decline . and it tastes so fucking good .
<person> over there ?
white light . <person> . like being ripped inside out . slowly . like being born , maybe .
you ' re wet . oh my god .
the invasion plans .

i came on at <number> : <number> . <continued_utterance> you all right ?

it ' s not devious , it ' s what we have to do . you ' re leaving tomorrow . <continued_utterance> you write to my house , and put <person> ' s name on the return address . it ' s no big deal . <continued_utterance> you smell like cedar .
so do you . it ' s your smell i ' ll miss as much as anything .
was mom an adjustment ?
i ' m never going to meet anyone who ' s going to measure up to your mom in your eyes ? what do you think ? there ' s a perfect woman walking around out there ? <continued_utterance> there ' s no such thing as a perf -- <continued_utterance> god , she ' s beautiful .
<person> . how you do this to me ? i have full staff with you . i save your spot . i was counting on you . yes , yes . but the gap ? what you think you do there ? are there girls in swimming suits ? have you forgotten ? tips . do you get tips ? cash money ? <continued_utterance> well , come see us this summer , eh ? you ' re a good kid . a good worker . <person> , you too .

they ' ll never get there in time to save him . they have to come half way across the galaxy . <person> , <person> is less than a parsec away .
if he ' s still alive .
absolutely .
<person> hunting . <person> out .
<person> , i didn ' t come back just to say good-bye . i shouldn ' t tell you this , but you ' re the only one i can trust . and if i don ' t come back , i want somebody to know .
what are you talking about ?
when you grow up within spitting distance of hollywood , every mother seems to think her child is the next <person> . so when i was about <number> , my mom started taking me to all these auditions for things .
so are you the next <person> ?
um . yeah . thanks . it ' s great to hear someone else say that out loud . <person> to explain .
i `` get '' it .
that ' s right .
<person> to retirement ?
are you or aren ' t you ?
i think that ' s what it says on my driver ' s license .
i only need about four hours a night .
me too . never slept eight hours in my life .
and you freaked . a little .
just like to make sure . that your past . and my future . <person> real different .
hi .
hey .
and he records it . <person> kill .
he records himself raping and killing her --
when ' s the funeral ?
sunday . we should leave as soon as we can .
it ' s a soporific .
what ' s that ?
the damage was considerable . but she ' s insured . thanks , again .
well , just to put it back in our minds , could you repeat what you told us . about the <continued_utterance> <person> you inferred was replaced by the d- <number> , which must have been a spare .
so it would be too much to mention it again . . . <continued_utterance> wow . it ' s the perfect beach house .
i know . my mother doesn ' t know how to do things that aren ' t perfect .
<person> , this isn ' t the way . who are you ?
they ' re from my old convent . <continued_utterance> run ! take off !
<person> till i say something before you start in . i rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the house because of the bus schedule .
no . <person> .
changing the sparks . they showed it on tv . what d ' you think ?
i think television ' s a dangerous thing .
<person> , sir . i thought it added a touch of reality to the performance . <continued_utterance> my mission was a success , sir . i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation .
<person> work . the download ?
i ' m ready !
stay ready . stay by yourself in your room .
that would be lieutenant garber , and he ' s very busy upstairs .
<person> ' t tell me he ' s `` busy '' . i asked for an ambulance for this woman and .
<person> .
mr . <person> , did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs . <person> ?
mr . <person> ? oh mr . <person> . ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car .
oh my ! oh my . maybe you better come out now , <person> .
i need a sample of your blood . what do your borg friends say ? resistance is futile . <continued_utterance> yes . the bait you couldn ' t refuse . i learned there might be an existing prototype from a cardassian historian , then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on <person> . i knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the enterprise the closest ship to romulus when i contacted <person> .
all of this so you could capture me ?
how do you know that ?
i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .
go to bed at night happy and then murdered . would we have woken up ?
we ' re alive .
this is fascinating .
of course it is .
they look like cargo carriers . <continued_utterance> what is it ?
a face ! i saw -- it was like a child -- he points . the porthole is empty .
<person> . we ' ve got to go back .
what ?
in new york . they said she had a . personality disorder . wavey and it was named <person> . <continued_utterance> all these hallucin .
the white dog . sometimes with the skinny ghost . kids do things like that , it ' s called imagination . like the necklaces .
<person> . i would appreciate any . suggestions you might have .
first -- move us within transporter range and beam those people to the enterprise .
if i don ' t meet the ship , my people will go home without me .
please understand . if you go this way , you ' ll never get to your ship . the police know about <person> . we have to go another way . i ' ll get you to your ship . i promise .
oh my god , is that the needle ? it ' s a fucking cocktail straw .
trust me , i ' m very good at this . <person> again . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t that fun ?
every word , starling ? every gesture ?
right down to the kleenex i used . <person> , why ? is something wrong ?
he ' s saying , `` take me to your leader . `` he wants to know who ' s in charge .
i ' m in charge . <continued_utterance> with an `` o '' . <person> with an `` o '' .
sure , <person> .
but not no more . now people take advantage . <person> ain ' t what it used to be . there ' s something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
it ' s delicious , trust me .
does it have wheat in it ?
do you see any way , through negotiations , to bring the separatists back into the republic ?
not if they feel threatened . the separatists don ' t have an army , but if they are provoked , they will move to defend themselves . i ' m sure of that . and with no time or money to build an army , my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help .
please , jean . i called your wife . i ' m having someone take you home to her . there is nothing left to do here . <continued_utterance> i ' m ordering you home .
you ' re really good with people .
i attended two . <person> and mother of good counsel . i remember <person> . and . i don ' t know , <person> . mr . <person> . oh , and mrs . <person> , she had a glass eye .

can i help you ?
i have , <person> .
but the plague
<person> , please -- this is a grown- up apartment now .
i guess i didn ' t realize how big i was until i saw it on your faces .

i ' ve never been taken off an assignment in my life . give me twenty- four hours and i ' ll have him for you .
you ' re not hearing me .

<person> .
<person> ? -- he gave it to henslowe .

they should let us in free .
<person> right . they come here , drink our water , use our fields , they leave all their crap in our drains -
<person> , i ' m serious . serious i am , <person> .
mahogany . i ' d say that cost at least a couple hundred . maybe three .
. and he said that if the police found your lighter there , that ' s all they ' d need -- something to prove you were at the scene of the murder .
that big lie about my wanting him to get it back means he ' s going to put my lighter on that island !
i just woke up . i ' m sorry .
you just woke up !
he ' s no father to you . <continued_utterance> <person> with that one . he won ' t tell me anything , but i know there ' s something strange going on over at the lanes . if you ask me , i ' d say the old fart wants to die .
where can i find him ?
why do you cry ?
you mean people ? i don ' t know . we just cry . you know . when it hurts .
it is not my riding day , my lord .
bless me , i thought it was a horse .
- and what monsoon would that be ? i ' d like to speak to your supervisor , son .
i don ' t think that ' s a good idea . he is a very important man , <person>-
mind you , not that one true fact didn ' t come out of <person> ' s mouth tonight : self-admittedly , he committed a vicious crime of jealousy against <person> ! now we have to clear <person> , don ' t we ? . but i ' ll have to sacrifice him . . to do it . am i doing right ?
she is looking at hunsecker .
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone .
still well on our side . <continued_utterance> i think it ' s worth a look . <person> ' t worry , <person> , we ' ll get you to betazed with time to spare .
well , mr . <person> , what if it was an option ?
well , people are always assuming we are .
nobody comes in on sunday .
<person> will be in on tuesday .
no ! he ' s never once said to me that he was going to `` throw the book at me so hard it ' ll knock my ass from here till tuesday . `` anyways what ' s up ?
have you heard of this case ? mrs . x ? she murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again .
the thing with <person> - it ' s like the sun shines on you and it ' s glorious , then he forgets you and it ' s very very cold .
so i ' m learning .
i mean cute dumb . now bend over !
how come you always want to make love to me from behind ? is it because you want to pretend i ' m somebody else ? <person> sighs .

i said watch where you ' re going , bitch ! <continued_utterance> now what , bitch ? now who ' s the bitch , bitch ?
i ' m married , ishmael . it isn ' t right for us to be alone . people will t .

oh man , it ' s a crazy story-
<person> , take it easy . i ' ll trust your judgment - you don ' t have to protest with me . <continued_utterance> why are you trembling , dear . ?
history repeats itself . everything that happened to <person> . began with a smear like this .
and with ten percent of his future , you ' re great , too , <person> .
went over to philly yesterday an ' seen the folks . it ' s nice you send them the fifty a month .
it ' s a goddamn simulation . <continued_utterance> a three dimensional , completely immersive scenario . touch , taste , sound , sight and smell .

ze alarms ! <person> went off !

we always get this way at weddings .
i do not always get this way at weddings .
since when do you take an antidepressant ?
ugggh , mother , do you know anyone who doesn ' t ?
it ' ll only take <number> minutes or so . you can pick it up at the window down the hall .
but what about all these other people ?
so , he calls my parents and they make me go to a psychologist who kept asking me all these dick questions . my parents wouldn ' t even let me eat dick-shaped foods for , like , months ! no carrots , no pop-sicles , no hot-dogs . you know how many fucking foods are shaped like dick ?
wow . that ' s really messed up .
some journey .
it ' s taken me all over the world .
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation .
why ?
i ' ll tell you where it ' s fucking got me mate . it ' s got me earning four thousand a week . how much do you earn in your little cubicle up in manchester . go on how much do you fucking earn . you probably don ' t even earn two grand a fucking <continued_utterance> month you prick .

jesus . <person> ' t ask questions like that up in the wine country . they ' ll think you ' re a moron .
just tell me .
why ? why didn ' t you tell me ?
how can you ask me that ? were we together ? where we going to be ? you had your world and i had mine . i wanted him in mine , not chasing through the universe with his father . <continued_utterance> he ' s a lot like you in many ways . nothing i could do about it . he ' s smarter , of course ; that goes without saying . most of genesis is really his . <continued_utterance> this is it , isn ' t it ? we ' re never going to get out of here .
really .
yeah . <person> mary pat was discussing it . you know she thinks it ' s a sin .

what is it ?
it ' s a surprise .
hey , guys . how ' s it going ?
excellent . my friend and i are up here doing the wine tour , and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a syrah .
`` i come , anon -- but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee -- ''
`` <person> ! ''
your time is up , busyboy .
who identified the body ?
then have a donut --
no .
what happened to that , is that you ' re too stupid to get into the schools i did !
i was not too stupid , i was too lazy !
bathroom .
did you drink and dial ? <person> ' s silence confirms his guilt and shame . <continued_utterance> why do you always do this ? victoria ' s gone , man . gone . <person> . <continued_utterance> stop it . you are blowing a great opportunity here , <person> . fucking <person> , man . she ' s great . she ' s cool . she ' s funny . she knows wine . what is this morose come-down bullshit ? these girls want to party . and what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on , what was it , vouvrays ? i mean , come on !
i want you to look at the screen .
i can ' t breathe !
theo , what would you do if you couldn ' t bowl ?
i don ' t know . it ' s all i ever wanted to do .
i ' m sorry about what happened .
<person> , that was my fault .
<person> .
<person> .
we ' ve established that . just tell me about his clothing then . <continued_utterance> was he wearing a scottish kilt or jeans ? <continued_utterance> let me ask you two something . <person> ' t be embarrassed by the answer . it is possible . just possible now , you might have been chasing each other around ? you said you went in opposite directions .
<person> , it sounds as strange to me saying it , as it is to you hearing it . but we couldn ' t see him . he stayed mostly in the shadows . all we could make out was movement . but i ' ll tell you something with absolute certainty . there was someone watching our house last night . he was looking in my children ' s windows and i want you to find him <person> . i need you to take this seriously , just incase , it is something serious .
she works for tips !
you ' re blind , dude . <person> .

what is that ? what are you doing ? what do you want to do -- kill him ?
what do you think i can do ?
i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you ' re the king .
it ' s not human , <person> . whatever it is , it ' s not human , and i am threatened by that . evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened . and i want to win . i want humans to win . so i am killing it before it kills me .
you fucking bastard .
lock the fucking door , <person> .
are you fucking spying ?
maybe now you appreciate the danger we ' re in . it was touching the way you stood by me in there . `` stand by your man '' . i was moved . you were very good . i don ' t think he even understands that you did it for him .
he doesn ' t know what ' s going on .
then i have to guess you ' re not `` on assignment '' . you ' re in the wrong place , baby . how did you find me . ? <continued_utterance> well , i guess i ' m not as smart as i thought i was .

i ' m more a hot-blooded killer , huh ?
there was this one guy that was kinda cool . he taught me engines . hold this a second . <person> screwed it up , of course . <person> or later she ' d always tell them about judgment day and me being this world leader and that ' s be all she wrote .
<person> wrench please .
<person> . i ' ll talk to <person> and see what i can find out .
i don ' t trust <person> .
hey , don ' t ask me . ask the man who put in the good word . <continued_utterance> if t . j . didn ' t push for me , i never would ' ve made it .

no , i didn ' t , sir . i ' ve never seen this man before in my life . i meant the other one .
why ' d you come here , <person> ?
because i realized what i was feeling for you , have always felt for you , was something i didn ' t understand , like a language i didn ' t speak . it scared me so i did what i do . i snuck away . turns out the heart attack was easy to get over . you were somethin ' else . and when i went to see all those women , i found out i was never really present for any of them . and something inside me at some point , had just . shut off . that ' s when i think my heart gave out and you saved me . i finally get what it ' s all about . i ' m <number> years old and i am in love for the first time in my life . and that ' s what i came here to say .
am i lying ? are you sure ? are you absolutely sure i ' m lying ? then explain to me about the jellyfish . earlier . <person> did we see jellyfish ? <person> doesn ' t fear jellyfish . you do . they ' re your fear , aren ' t they ?

schmucks are people too you know . <person> doesn ' t seem a little harsh ?
but -- if you ' re a user -- then everything you ' ve done has been part of a plan .

you are enjoying it ? ! ?
i am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter . i am enjoying the fact that i really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything i say . <person> nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a somewhat new way . as if <person> were an actual person instead of an upsetting extension of herself .

i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . <person> . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
are you talking about me ?
<person> , would it help if you told him it was my fault .

go ahead , be my guest .
when i last saw you , i was unprepared . i did not know what to expect . in these past weeks , i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . you have to understand who i am and what i am . i am a musician and i believe in music . i am an artist and i believe in art . <person> in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man ' s spiritual needs . i must confess , however , to being extremely naive . i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . my entire life was devoted to music because , and this is very important , because i thought that i could , through music , do something practical .
<person> : the world runs on manners .
the last third on exfil , in geneva . me and the girl . as agreed .
well , i wouldn ' t mind be married to you . would you mind being married to me ?

hmm . you still live there ?
god , no .
his real name is <person> . a former patient of mine , whose romantic attachments ran to , shall we say , the exotic . ? i didn ' t kill him , merely tucked him away . <person> much as i found him , in that ridiculous car , in his own garage , after he ' s missed three appointments . you ' d have him under `` missing person '' - which , in poor <person> ' s case , could hardly be more true .
if you didn ' t kill him , then who did ?
gosh , you look nice .
. what . ?
how fast would you say mrs . <person> was going ? to the best of your recollection ?
seventy-two miles an hour .
<person> , that ' s very wrong . <person> ' s gone . you know that .
i know . <continued_utterance> she wanted me to tell you --
you have to amputate <person> the kid .
i know , but i can ' t .

so , it ' s from the future , is that right ?
you put filth in my child ' s mouth .
aw .
i had a dog like that once .
it ' s not his dog , numbnuts . they ' re spies .
i don ' t understand him .
<person> cotard is a man already dead , living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis . time is concentrated and chronology confused for him . up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation , but now he has turned to stone .
i love that dream .
that was nothing compared to this humiliation , nothing .
i don ' t know , why did you ?
what ?
he was furious and , by the time i could have put on a tropical island mood , i was out on the street ! . that night mr . <person> calls me into his office here . he ' s got nothing against me , he says but he can ' t afford to antagonize columnists . i told him i still have <person> at military academy , but <person> ' s made of ice . <person> that <person> is moving to leave her so that he can catch <person> , <person> detains him with an appeal : <continued_utterance> do you think you could do something , <person> ?
that ' s what i ' m thinking , <person> . maybe .
just roll with it . what ' s the worst that can happen ?
you ' ll go insane . kill yourself .
princess leia , before your execution i would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational . no star system will dare oppose the emperor now .
the more you tighten your grip , <person> , the more star systems will slip through your fingers .
<person> ' t you think it ' s about time you shut yours ? who are you to tell a man like <person> ' <person> to shut up ? !
<person> , that isn ' t important --
he ' s being thorough , that ' s all . i ' m learning about my son , <person> , now he ' s missing . i ' m learning a great deal about him . i hope you can fill in some more blanks for me . <person> has been good enough to do that , about <person> .
i ' ll try my best , sir . obviously i ' ll do anything to help <person> . <person> looks at him in contempt .
cloners ? are they friendly ?
it depends .
yes .
what about <person> ?
a sense of humor .
i ' ll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i ' ve become obsessed with him .
the starling bitch wants you to rot here , in this little box , till your teeth fall out and you ' re soiling diapers . you ' ve seen the old ones , hannibal . they weep when their stewed peaches get cold . that ' ll be you , too . unless - you trade with me .
as he sits chummily on the table .
no , we don ' t .
then you ' re going to have to do it without me .
play him like a cop and haul him in now and get your arrest , or tag him and let him lead you to the really big fish .
you ' re fishing and he ' s getting visas for bombers .
you have orange whips ?
orange who ? not from ' round here , are ya ?
apprehend the fugitive , then call it in for your pat on the head .
<person> to disappoint you .
so . you ' re not from around here , huh ?

i ' m just trying to be a gentleman , show some respect .
<person> ?
i ' m tired , <person> .
-- are they confirmed ?
fred , whitney , we ' re waiting on who else .
you ' ll resign , and that ' s all there is to it . it might look bad , but if that ' s the worst you suffer .
i won ' t quit !
this way , sir ! <continued_utterance> it seems to have an encrypted security system . <person> warriors are closing in on them .
alacrity would be appreciated , commander .
no ? who am i , then ?
a puppet .
mph rmph rm .
how are you feeling , son ?
her .
you ' re gorgeous .

<person> . the kids are wonderful . i have a great job at lens shapers .
<person> to disturb the tranquillity of outer space on <person> , but i ' m off to the caribbean in a few hours , and i wanted to make sure you ' d got the transmission on the security sweep .

what is it ?
<person> me see . it ' s some kind of countdown clock .
i ' m sorry . when i ' m around you , my mind is no longer my own .
it ' s the situation . the stress .
i ' d rather sing than do anything !
it ' s better than ice cream .
<person> . face to face . <person> this !
<person> ' t do it , professor !
i hear ya .
and i guess , i thought that after that big mess with <person> -- you ' d never want to get married .
<person> , huh ? <continued_utterance> <person> did we leave <person> , <person> ?
she left us . you know that better than anyone . except me .
<person> ' s about as far as i ' ve ever gone . is this person a he or a she ?
it ' s a secret . but i guess you wouldn ' t understand about that , either .
tell me .
i can ' t tell you . you ' ve got to see .
then you are wrong .
<person> and politics , yeah , art and politics . <person> ' s look at that . you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich , played in countries the nazis had conquered . are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from <number> on wasn ' t a commercial for <person> and all he stood for ?
<person> , cool , i ' ll probably just grab my stuff from yours then . <continued_utterance> as if i ' m not gon na come with you nutter .
fucking hell , man . i thought you were gon na leave me cold .
no . no . thanks . <continued_utterance> he ' s in the hospital . he ' s under arrest , too . they planted reefer cigarettes on him . in his overcoat pocket . <continued_utterance> <person> , if you see him again they might . might kill him .
who is `` they '' ?
you write a lot about adultery . is that from personal experience ?
<person> , what a saucy question !
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t leave until we figure out a way to document it , to prove its existence to the planet earth . this is hilarious : he thinks it ' s god , but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home .
<person> wants to destroy it .
what ?
i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . <person> . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
in here !
i just put my car in the garage .
i hope i ' m not interrupting .
no , not at all . we were just talking about . <person> and i met yesterday , so .
you ' re going to attack them ? !
<person> , the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial star destroyer .
ok . thank you .
oh dear .
<person> ? what about me ? crazy old fool ! goddamn near slit my throat !
you ' ve had worse from shaving . what ' d you do to set him off ?
so . <person> . the calypso bar .

what time do you have to be there ?
eight o ' clock .
i . have no idea .
i couldn ' t resist .
do not sabotage me . if you want to be a lightweight , that ' s your call . but do not sabotage me .
aye-aye , captain .
that ' s the way i thought of them sometimes .
berries .
then it never happened . <person> goes to answer the door . <continued_utterance> hi .
hi . <person> ?
there you are .
right this way , please .
people want to sell privately .
a modern . impressionist . renaissance .
<person> , i .
but i don ' t care about that now . he knew what he was doing today . he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage - if i would bend to every whim of his , like <person> ! i couldn ' t do that , <person> .
what is it ?
you know what it is , <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s the squid ! stop it !
it ' s nothin ' compared to what you could be makin ' on the big con . you ' re wastin ' your time workin ' street marks .
hey look . you think i ' m gon na run out on ya or somethin ' ? just cause we hit it big . <person> , i owe you everything . if you hadn ' t taught me con , i wouldn ' t know nothin ' .
<person> . that ' s good to hear .
hey , don ' t thank me or anything .
yes . i mean , no . i mean , maybe he would find her , i mean you attractive . maybe he doesn ' t like to dance . maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don ' t dance either .
maybe it doesn ' t matter if he ' s a good dancer cause it ' s a slow song , if that ' s what he ' s afraid of .
i know . i love that .
. medallions of pork with a dusting of black truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped potatoes . and finally a copper river salmon grilled on an alder wood plank . and that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed watercress . <continued_utterance> and who gets the wine list ?
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ . i ought to have it taken out .
or teach it a better tune .
<person> was not . unbalanced when i married him . and he was not . ' indifferent to women ' no matter what they said !
i ' m not fighting with you , puss . she gets up and walks around in considerable agitation .
then what ' s the matter ?
i ' m all right , ma . <person> ' t worry about me .
i bet he ' s lying .
<person> went to new york .
i ' m sorry , iris . i didn ' t mean that .
you ' re not much with girls , are you ?
you can try .
<person> was washing <person> . in the shower . what did you think that was about ?
i don ' t know !
you didn ' t see ?
underwater ?
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?
no . i was alone . my sister <person> was sick and stayed home that day .
was there anything unusual about the driver , <person> , or the bus that particular morning ?
<person> ! !
where did you learn that ?
this precinct didn ' t do any business at the waverly theater .
i didn ' t imagine it -
i have no plans to call on you , clarice , the world being more interesting with you in it . be sure you extend me the same courtesy .
you know i can ' t make that promise .
and i can do it . when ' s the wedding ?
what ?
what ' s that ?
<person> ' t call me <person> . it ' s just <person> now .
you ' re picking up my lingo , hon . <continued_utterance> <person> , i like this new attitude of yours . you ' re growing up and i like it ! i don ' t like it when you ' re limp and dependent , when you ' re odd and wayward . this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world . <person> , don ' t forget , dear , you won ' t always have me with you , will you . ?
no , i won ' t .
<person> !
<person> , you just said fuck again .
. and the hardest thing is deciding what i should tell you and what not to . well , anyway , i ' ve got a while yet before you ' re old enough to understand the tapes . they ' re more for me at this point . to help get it all straight . <continued_utterance> should i tell you about your father ? that ' s a tough one . will it change your decision to send him here . knowing ? but if you don ' t send <person> , you could never be . god , you can go crazy thinking about all this . i suppose i ' ll tell you . i owe him that . and maybe it ' ll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime ' s worth .
he says you are very beautiful , senora , and he is ashamed to ask five american dollars for this picture , but if he does not , his father will beat him .
well , then , it don ' t look good for the huskies .
that ' s for sure .
are you crying ?
no .
i don ' t know .
oh .
<person> . earlier you were asking for help . what ' s changed ?
it ' s messy . the thing ' s got a gun . we ' re just asking for somebody to get killed .
i ' m walking around the house !
<person> , i ' ve decided to get over the whole `` you saw me naked '' thing . so , we don ' t have to deal with it anymore . <person> ?
our eyes reflect our lives , don ' t they ? yours are so confident .
how did you end up on <person> ?
why not ?
she ran away . about six months ago .
<person> , my brother isn ' t as bad as he ' s painted . he isn ' t perfect , but -
but he isn ' t going to like this , <person> . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i wouldn ' t give him a second thought if not for you .
you want to see it better , we could go out on the roof .
. wouldn ' t that be dangerous ?
french toast , right ?
no . <person> . <person> , please .
in twenty-four hours , <person> is supposed to conduct the very first warp test . from a missile silo in montana . if i ' m right , the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship .
and if they succeed , humans won ' t make <person> with the vulcans tomorrow . as <person> i should be the one beaming down .
he ' s a doctor , isn ' t he ?
here are some pajamas .
i knocked , but guess you didn ' t hear me .
what do you want ?
no , thank you . i hate jellyfish . <continued_utterance> . when i was six , my younger brother and i -- we went swimming in the pacific . at my mother ' s beach house . we both felt stinging , and when we came out of the water , he was wearing jellyfish head to toe .
my gosh , <person> .
yes , i did .
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants .
so why didn ' t you chop it off ?
err , because we didn ' t . now <person> we have or rather you have a problem .
lie . that ' s one . keep going .
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed . and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like .
i don ' t want to be too hard on you , but as executor of the estate i have to consider the interests of the new owner . how about , say , a hundred in full settlement ?
well --
but she ' s been exposed to the underside of life . she is the underside of life .
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
so , are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees ?
yes .
get the fuck outta here !
i don ' t know , i just found out about this .
i might stop you .
oh i can see you ' ve had a bad day . we ' ll see the house another time , okay ?
<person> .
what kind of things ?
he hates me .
you hate him ? cole shakes his head , `` no . ! <continued_utterance> your mom set that up ? <continued_utterance> you ever tell her about how it is with <person> ?
this is your neighborhood . your turf . you should get to know ' em .

. there ' s plenty of movies around here . i haven ' t seen any of them , but i ' m sure they ' re good .
no , travis . you ' re a sweet guy and all that , but i think this is it .
okay , i guess .
how about dinner tonight ?
not yet , <person> .
<person> , with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the federation council ' s not sitting out here , we are .
<person> never said much about him . he dies . even before the war .
stop ! i don ' t want to know . <person> still . so . it was <person> that ordered you here ?
just tell me you ' re sorry .
i am sorry .
i still think you ' ve got a chance with <person> . she got mad hot over last summer , and clearly hasn ' t realized it , `cause she still flirts with you .
are you joking , man ? let ' s see here . she dated <person> , <person> , <person> and what ' s-his-face . all of those were cool guys . she ' s been hot way longer than you think . why would she end her high school career with me ?
my god . <person> . and <person> ! what a surprise . i can ' t remember the last time you brought me flowers .
they ' re from both of us .
yes , i ' m glad you made it .
oh , yeah . i ' m late . <person> .
oh-huh .
oh my !
i needed you immediately to help oversee the re-fit . . your service record on the talos is exemplary , but there are a few things i would like to discuss with you regarding my requirements for a first officer . shall we say dinner in my quarters at <number> hours ?
very good , sir .
yes , but .
you got your camera ?
what is it and why ?
you make your customers ' motives a part of your business ?
i ' m sure she ' ll call . six years is a long time . you don ' t just break it off cleanly after six years .
i know , but she did . she ' s with someone else now .
so you ' re saying we just pretend is didn ' t happen ? it happened ! the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america ! who the fuck are you to bury this ? !
fine . do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains ? the gangbangers ' ll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground . and when the fires start the street cops ' ll be capping off at anything that moves . it ' ll be all- out war and you know it .
i got stones to sell , fat to chew and many different men to see about many different dogs , so if i am not rushing you , could you spit shine the top of your smoothie and move a little faster ?
hold tight <person> , when in rome .
. i don ' t know . probably not .
so then this isn ' t crazy . it ' s a sure bet .
we can ' t leave without you !
it ' s okay , i am done for .

it ' s very pretty , <person> . thank you .
no , as soon as i get back in school , i ' m going to work part- time for a law firm . did you know there are as many people in law school as there are practicing lawyers ?
sounds familiar .
you said <person> talks to <person> at night . you ever listen ?
not really . <person> ' t be right .
yes .
<person> , let ' s see . how long were you in the camp for ?
<person> ' t tell me . no cabs .
no , your wife wouldn ' t let me leave this morning .
what do you want ?
i want you to get <person> to abandon his plan .
you look tired .

we ' re . not together .
i ' d heard that . but she ' s well ?
the <continued_utterance> yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality .
so you said at the time . speaking of which , your protg ' s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
i ' m not going anywhere .
they ' re going to execute her . <person> , a few minutes ago you said you didn ' t want to just wait here to be captured . now all you want to do is stay .
you ' ll have sex in college . everyone does . and if not , you ' ll have the bang bus .
but the key is to be good at sex by the time you ' re in college . you don ' t want girls to think you suck dick at fucking .
you forgot sexy .
no , i didn ' t forget sexy .
something ' s different about you today .
if i told you that there ' s a terrorist on this train , that i was sent here to catch him , would you believe me ?
we found the computer outlet , sir .
plug in . he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network .
no , <person> . we can ' t drop the lawsuit . you know how much we need the money .
why ? you got money from <person> ' insurance with the school board . we all did .
well , the force is what gives a <person> his power . it ' s an energy field created by all living things . it surrounds us and penetrates us . it binds the galaxy together . <continued_utterance> now , let ' s see if we can ' t figure out what you are , my little friend . and where you come from .
i saw part of the message he was .
<person> ?
the walkers have agreed . the ottos . <person> ' s parents . it ' s important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that ' s why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears .
we are . cautious people . you would say conservative . there would be time for celebrating with others when a paper was signed .
you thought the deceased might .
stop it ! ! ! stop it ! ! ! <continued_utterance> get away from him ! ! leave him alone ! ! you stupid jerks ! ! he ' s retarded ! ! can ' t you see that ? ! ! get away from him ! !
he was stealing my baby .
sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us .
pride ? ! ? <person> , you ' re young , and you don ' t have a very firm grip on politics . i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time .
well , it wasn ' t the simple , but yeah .
how was it hard ?
you see the look on that preppy puke ' s face ? <person> ' pissed in his topsiders .
<person> . it was funny . but it cost me money .
this is <person> , the policeman assigned to protect me . <person> .
<person> .
you want the longer sofa ?

i guess this is the one you can see catalina from . only this isn ' t the day . <continued_utterance> hey , what ' s this with the door ? there isn ' t any lock .
there are no locks anywhere in this house .
how d ' you do it then ?
gently put it ' s head down there ; then quick in the skull with an air rifle . pluck it while it ' s warm , little pot to catch all the blood -
<person> g-d . i was starting to think i ' d killed the wrong man .
you shouldn ' t smoke so many of those .
i think so . they ' re on location in arizona , shooting a western . i ' m free every evening , every week- end . if you want , we could work at your place .

can i help you ? <person> , i ' m really busy .
to a mets game ? i must ' ve really liked you .
you took me to see the beatles .
it ' s okay . they just carry water to and from sinks and bathtubs and toilets . it ' s like in your body you have veins and . um .
capillaries .
okay . i ' ll talk about it . your best friends get screwed over by their guys -- how can you not get distant ?
it ' s more than that -- lately , i haven ' t been feeling a connection to --
horses - and sheep .
how long did you live there ?
yeah . just for a split second .

<person> spider-man . i don ' t think i can make it . you mustn ' t waste time saving me . you must save the world ! you must go and stop <person> !
where can i find him . ?
well , i ' ll live with it , i ' ve lived with it all my life . my dad was a cop , he said , `` whatever you do , honey , never go out with a cop '' . so , what did i do ? i got a job with the cops . then i married a cop . i probably gave birth to a cop . <person> ! come over here and eat , it ' s hot .
maybe you and <person> should stay with my mom . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t start . the only reason is that the neighborhood ' s shi . . crummy . i just don ' t like the idea of leaving you alone here at night .
a few of us knew .
and all he cared about was doing his duty . that ' s all . that ' s all . he used to tell me .
be quiet .
he has made the choice , <person> . with your own eyes you saw it yesterday .
<person> , you did fine .
`` age of enlightenment '' . <person> . like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference . how demeaning . i may as well have just said `` let me jump your ignorant bones . `` .
that top cost more than my education .
my pants cost more than your education .
oh , i ' ll save this , all right . <continued_utterance> and i ' ll think of you . when i <continued_utterance> put lot on . <continued_utterance> i don ' t make mistakes . about that kind of thing .
it was so big , i thought it was a tea cozy for your car . but if it ' s for me , it has to be bigger , huh ?
i don ' t know honey . soon we hope . you want it to end quickly , huh ?
oh , i don ' t care , i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and it ' s pissing me off .

<person> , did you see one of them ?
double check each assault phaser . make certain that the range setting is no more than thirty meters . we don ' t want to blast through the hull . <person> turns and picks up his bat ' leth sword off a nearby console . he checks the sharpness of the blade .

. we .
was the girl in the whorehouse ? what about your other leads ? . the boyfriend , the . professor . ?
she ' s gon na trip over her own feet , if she doesn ' t get her hair out of her eyes .
pushing her hair over her eyes . means she ' s avoiding a confrontation . <continued_utterance> if she ' s twirling it , she ' s playing something out in her mind . if she ' s stopped combing it , she might be depressed .
that ' s yer boat .
said it was .
this fucking cess pit that you love so much . where has this place got you , man , where has it fucking got you , smartest kid in the class , four fucking a levels and you ' re getting chased by the police , getting mugged , selling crack cocaine to oap ' s . nice life .
i ' ll tell you where it ' s fucking got me mate . it ' s got me earning four thousand a week . how much do you earn in your little cubicle up in manchester . go on how much do you fucking earn . you probably don ' t even earn two grand a fucking <continued_utterance> month you prick .

all .
<person> . and <person> ? can he start construction on the house again ? i ' ll be sending money every two weeks now .
we just paid him . he ' s coming next week .
so it ' s almost a retroactive decision . so i could , like , let ' s say , forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her .

there ' s nothing left <person> , that ' s why i haven ' t answered ?
<person> ' t fucking bullshit me shifty .
you seem pretty sure of that .
<person> was killed by the same man who ' s killing these girls . and <person> knows him . maybe even treated him . you think so , too , don ' t you ? or you ' d never have sent me to that asylum .

you want to tell me how you ' re doing this ?
close observation . you could say i ' m a collector of moments .
how much damage ?
to the craft ? none . not a scratch .
<person> a second , aren ' t you like a famous bachelor ?
i wouldn ' t say i ' m famous .
<person> , we can ' t release him because we don ' t have him . we never had him . and besides that , he ' s dead .

me having the fattest thighs .
dr . <person> .
yes .
<person> ' t judge a situation where you don ' t know what ' s involved .
i ' m not judging . <continued_utterance> i swear , sidney , i can ' t help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you .
it is all so . tragic .
. they ' re going to hit the march .
<person> , i ' ve watched you . you never really sing . you whisper . nothing comes out .
i don ' t want to mess anyone up .
<person> , i know you can hear me . did you find the bomber ?
<person> one : `` when <person> woke , she had the bed to herself . she sat up , bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings ; then memory returned , and she looked about her with a shiver . `` goodwin stops the audio .
you want to be hypnotized . <person> yes .

if we ' re gon na be a team , why not be a real team ?
we just paid him . he ' s coming next week .

i can ' t let you do that .
oh , you can ' t let me do that . what precisely is your involvement with these people .
and i said , boy , you speak spanish like a native . uh oh . it ' s been our little secret . now it ' s your secret , too .
i need to think about all this .
anything .
when your first officer insists that you can ' t go on away missions . ignore him --
where ?
i don ' t know ! <person> ' t say , would they ? they had to get out fast . the police . honestly .
but --
and the snakes ? you want to know about the snakes ? you saw one outside earlier , didn ' t you ? when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified .
why , <person> ? did the rancher fuck you ?
no .
there they are !
that ' s no battle , hot shot . they ' re just sitting there ! probably a freighter-tanker refueling .
no .
what are you doing ?
<person> ' t worry .
you sure right ?
<person> women are adorable , don ' t you think ?
i never really thought about it .
you don ' t get it ! it ' s a big thing for them , it ' s like . <person> ' s palace . prime-time . they ' re singing for the cardinals . it ' s like . `` <person> . `` if first prize was a trip to the vatican . they ' ve worked really hard , they deserve this .
<person> ?
because it ' s not a toy . it ' s a scientific instrument . <continued_utterance> you can play with them when i ' m around to supervise .
you ' re around now .
how could <person> plan on <person> snapping like that ?
he couldn ' t . my guess is <person> intended to kill <person> and make it look like suicide . the authorities would find the body and close the martin <person> file .
are you sure this is what <person> had in mind ?
i know it is . it ' s life . experience . take a deep breath .
master shakespeare
my lady <person> .
i won ' t believe what ?
i don ' t want to talk anymore . i want to go home , okay ? i want to go home .
no , i ' m fine , <person> .
<person> ! way to do it . <person> ! you don ' t follow the mets like you used to , do you , <person> ?
then why haven ' t you ever made a move , you pussy ?
because i respect her ! i ' m not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her .
<person> , i don ' t want to be lectured .
what do you want ? damn it , why isn ' t there a girl here ? you know this has nothing to do with age . this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wan na be out hopping galaxies .
hello .

anybody there with you ?
yes . beautiful women . in thongs .
i don ' t mean to pry ; i ' m just really nosey .
i ' m from here . sort of .
i can ' t get a read on this guy .
<person> ?
any criminal record ?
probably half a dozen traffic convictions . drunk driving . lost his licence . that ' s why he don ' t work no more . <continued_utterance> can ' t get off that shitty dump they live on . what little money comes in goes to booze .
freezing .

-- and help bring down <person> .
i ran the network . <person> was the go- between . he risked his life for us over there .

she still loves me .
no .
<person> , i can explain .
i got a personal letter from <person> lacocco . they fixed everything for nothing .
<person> . so you like the car ?
sure , he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz !
and who ' s feet is she on now ?
what do you mean no ? !
i happen to know for a fact that you don ' t have the power to commandeer my vehicle .
so , this could be your last night , huh ?
could be , i guess .
not at all . i think you ' re strength defines you . but it ' s thrilling when your defenses are down arid you ' re not isolated . that , i believe , is your winning combo . a killer combo actually .
. so i can ' t decide if you hate me or if maybe you ' re the only person who ever got me .
with the other hand , right ?
no , stupid . with the stubs . that ' s the whole point .
i love chocolate . i realized just yesterday how much i love it . i thought maybe , if they let you bring personal effects , you might have snuck some through , because . well , i ' ve been thinking about it .
what happened here ?
oh my god -- did you just hear lily ?
hey -- i need to talk . <continued_utterance> i ' m sitting here trying to write these vows and . is this something we really want to do ?

<person> .
i used to fancy her big time when we were kids .

<person> ' s a politician , i ' ve observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the senators .
<person> , i am , really .
well , then , you know , why are we here , if we don ' t matter to one another ?

a jedi ' s saber is his most precious possession .

mr . <person> ! mr . <person> ! welcome , <person> ! <person> ! <person> ! my pretty one ! are you ready to fall in love again ?

i knew <person> ' s hotshots were green . no reinforcements , then they walk right into an enemy stronghold .
i said nothing happened . <person> ' t you hear me ?
<person> ' t you feel well ?
yep . <person> .
who ?
do not speak to me of the koran , woman . you take our leader . a holy man . you put him in prison for preaching the word of god . you must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live .
but it ' s over , your point ' s been made , why spill any more blood ? those poor people out there in the street , they ' re fucking marching for your cause .
<person> want him for ?
he ' s not in trouble . it ' s personal .
hey , she doesn ' t want to go with you . come on . <continued_utterance> oh god , man . don ' t shoot me . my mistake . i ' m sorry .

<person> , recruit flores , reporting for duty , sir . she snaps zim a salute and hands him her orders .
bring something to drink .
yes . <person> .
oh and i don ' t because i have a children ? ! the problem is you ' re too self-involved to ever be a mother .
maybe the problem is your kids . maybe they ' re spoiled , coddled brats !
i can write it . i can ' t type it .
why ?
if he hadn ' t , we ' d be space by now .
admiral , this is <person> .
you could have just said you didn ' t remember .
i , uh , guess so . but i do .
i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . <person> straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .
what about bowling ?
<person> ? are you by any chance related to colonel joachim <person> ?
my father .
not a bad bit of rescuing , huh ? you know , sometimes i even amaze myself .
that doesn ' t sound too hard . besides , they let us go . it ' s the only explanation for the ease of our escape .
out of the question .
<person> let me try . i ' m begging you .
my wife ' s going to have a baby .
how about that .
you were . thanks .
a friend of mine said i ' ll feel like this one month for every year we were together . sort of a grieving rule-of- thumb . have you ever heard that ?
tonight .
well i haven ' t seen her in months . who knows what ' s going on in her head . you ' re really running out of excuses to come around , aren ' t you ?
obi-wan <person> . obi-wan ? now thats a name i haven ' t heard in a long time . a long time .
i think my uncle knew him . he said he was dead .
you really should go in , it ' s marvellous .
i ' m fine .
by three minutes . they were very different boys .
to lose one son so young , then to lose the other two years later ; to think you ' ve lost him . that must have been devastating .
it was yellow .
you didn ' t even see it .
what have you done to my ship ?
your ship ? hey , remember , you lost her to me fair and square .
i ' m looking for <person> .
oh , yes . so why not use the front door ?
you ' ve been chopping up the fucking <continued_utterance> gear all along . selling half of it to the fucking turks , cutting out <person> .
who told you that ?
like you ' d know what to do with it .
ha ha . i ' m really gon na miss your knee- slappers when me and <person> are at state .
black . <person> .
<person> ? i don ' t understand --
oh ! i get it , you mean a love bug .

<person> , yeah . <person> ' you remember i told you he had that job at the pinnacles , the , erm , storage warehouse .
<person> work . the download ?
he believes he has our communications protocols . but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels . <continued_utterance> <person> , puny human animal .
there are some questions that we need to address here .
what about ?
<person> , then jog left .
do we really got ta do this ?
-- we are not sure of that . we are not sure we aren ' t all hallucinating .
if <person> is beyond our comprehension , and she -- -- is here for reasons that can ' t be understood , isn ' t <person> here ?
then the oldest one , <person> , who never knows love ! rick ' waits to see that elizabeth is through , then:
i ' d like a shot at laertes . i think it ' s a much better part .
and . ?
she is only the princess of cool . <person> is the queen !
why , after two years , has nobody reported him missing ?
he wasn ' t missed . he had no family , or moved often . he had the musculature of a serious outdoorsman . he spent a lot of time in his kayak .
sounds like your captain ' s going to get hell when he gets back home .
what is hell ?
you are my superior officer . you are also my friend . i have been and always shall be yours .
will you accompany me to the bridge ?
so what ' s the problem ?
the problem is i have no idea who i ' m talking to right now .
i had a teacher like that once .
maybe that ' s why it ' s good . it ' s true , it ' s moving . now why don ' t you use that character .
what do you mean ? she can , it can make me do something i don ' t want to do ?
oh , no . you ' ll want to . badly . you won ' t think about anything else . you won ' t sleep . you won ' t eat . you ' ll lie . and god help anyone who tries to stop you .
uh oh . we got company .

just like new , dack . how about you ?
right now i feel like i could take on the whole empire myself .
<person> drove me back in his car .
is <person> here ?
mr . <person> , you shouldn ' t be standing .
<person> to take a whiz girls .
affirmative .
no , no , no . you got ta listen to the way people talk . <person> , you don ' t say like `` affirmative '' or some shit like that . you say . no problemo . <continued_utterance> it someone comes off to you with an attitude , you say `` eat me '' . if you wan na shine them on , it ' s `` hasta la vista , baby '' .
no .
<person> ' t mean there aren ' t any .
what happened ? i was on a merry-go- round somewhere . it made me dizzy .
you ' re a mad , crazy maniac , and you ought to be locked-up ! now will you get out of here and let me alone ?
<person> back . how are you feeling ?
i ' m alive . no thanks to you .
what the hell do you think you ' re doing ?

i ' d be torn .
he ' s far too up himself .
<person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> . get out !
i want to go home now .

<person> , <person> , it ' s not like in any stretch of the imagination , i think you ' re all that right for my daughter but i don ' t really appreciate hearing you on the phone with other women . it ' s like i ' m an accomplice to you cheating , it ' s .
your daughter knows i see other women .
inflation , tuition , college . children are damned expensive . i know .

. home . it ' s getting late . <person> . <continued_utterance> can i give you a ride to your car . ?
. nah . i ' m right across the street .
<person> !
what is it ?
i would suggest , <person> , for your own peace of mind , of course , that you work here at the house for a few days . it would be less embarrassing for you .
then what about practicing ? perhaps i ' d better forget <person> ?
no , it isn ' t . your name is <person> . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the one you couldn ' t save . what was his name ? `` <person> , we ' re going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . `` `` but i don ' t want to go swimming , <person> . i ' m scared . `` `` c ' mon , <continued_utterance> when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i can ' t get <person> on the radio . i ' m in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . `` was it really the squid that was attacking you , <person> -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ? <continued_utterance> i ' m not scaring you , am i <person> ? i hope i ' m not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , don ' t you ?
it ' s not me , <person> . i swear . it can ' t be .
the best teriyaki east of the pacific .

`` in love ? ''
`` out . ``
the americans are just showing their true colors as smelly bastards .
fight the power !
heaven . i have to tell him he ' s made a mistake . he should take <person> first . or <person> .
<person> . <person> doesn ' t like visitors .
<person> : this is the number of a public phone in downtown boston . it ' s a cutout , between the bordello , and the abductors . a call is placed when they have a package to deliver .
. you going to stake out the phone . ?
<person> heavens , no !
ah ah ! are you sure ? do you mean to tell me there wasn ' t a tiny moment - when you ' d been made really angry ? and what did you say ?
you can not , wessex will kill you
i know how to fight !
that ' s a horrible thing to say . the life i had before i met you . i knew how to do that , could do that forever . now look at me . what do i do with all this ?
can we talk tomorrow ?
. overcome by the events around her , the presence of a high-powered .
i never touched her . my mother ' s gr .
you won ' t know him .
are you taking the piss ?
a balloon and a banana ! tell me , <person> , what were you thinking ?
those girls were asking questions . they ' ve got it rough . i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age . i wish somebody would talk to me about it now .
most people consider that normal .
i am not most people .
i will be most grateful for your speed , <person>aster jedi .
time to go .
as i said , he isn ' t italian . besides , i thought they just killed them .
<person> ' t be naive . they can ' t kill everybody . they have different punishments for different things . like , if they kill a stool pidgeon , they leave a canary on the body .
<person> . <person> since divali . who stole constable varma ' s bicycle outside <person> last thursday ?
you know who that was ?
it ' s a hunting knife , right here on my hip . <continued_utterance> i was on my way to the woods . my gear ' s in the trunk . would you like me to hand it to you ? i don ' t know what the procedure is for something like this .
take the weapon off your hip , place it on the ground , and kick it toward me .
yeah . pain in the neck , you know , i was all set
did he say why ?
the gas station guy ? why would the gas station guy chase us .
i don ' t know , <person> . i guess for not paying .
everyday things . yes .
for example , he ' s just come back from a fire and he . um . that ' s a fine house . you look at that , and you know , there ' s nice people that live there .
of course you did ! we were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it ! that ' s the definition of bailing !
if you said we should burn our dicks off and i didn ' t , that ' s not bailing !
who the hell ' s fault is -
- a u . s . senator who ' s half out of her head because her daughter ' s going to be murdered today ! and all because of your mind games with fucking <person> !
take your time . take a good look .
ah , a-are you sure they can ' t see us ?
you pretty jumpy , connor . <continued_utterance> oye , big <person> ! que pasa ? who ' s your very large friend ? <continued_utterance> hmmm . <person> , huh ? okay .
<person> ?
can ' t be by hand . it ' s too perfect .
<person> ' t sound much like lionel prichard and the wolfington brothers . they can ' t take a piss without wetting the front of their pants . <continued_utterance> second thing this week i can ' t explain .
jennyhaydn . <continued_utterance> i am good . <continued_utterance> what is that ?
horses .
yeah , well . he may have to be a little more than on the team . i ' ve been speaking to the father . <continued_utterance> what about if we had to go `` off the meter '' ?
. with the mission , sir .
i tried to reach you twice -
what do you do for that hundred a week . fall out of bed ?
it was an accident .
oh my god , what have you done ?
i ' ve deactivated the sensory inputs . that flesh on your body is just meat , now .
no . no , please . you can not .
and have them clomping about in my life ? oh dear , no . at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own . how did you feel when you saw him , <person> ? may i call you <person> ?
scared , at first . then - exhilarated .
it ' s you .
it ' s me ?
you could have killed us both ! !
he ' s kidnapping me ! ! !
<person> ?
just look around . there ' s a lot of her spread about . if you don ' t remember the face , you must have heard the name of <person> .
i ' m sorry
you ' re always sorry .
have you ever done it before ?
well , i ' ve seen it done a dozen times .
-- <person> ' t work .
works for the israelis .
he won ' t show . but we want to be here in case he does . four plainclothes officers will form a perimeter watching the four corners .
a perimeter , excellent .
read the card .
`` to the love of my life , <person> , <person> . ``
so every time you think about showing that jury strength . or honor or composure . or dignity .
i should show them an american ?
what do you mean he ' s not coming ?
get me out of here . -- get me out of here !
stop it ! right now ! you can ' t cry , <person> . other kids can afford to cry . you can ' t .
what is wrong with your eyes ?
patterns , repetition of behavior .
now imagine a killer with no patterns , no tell-tale fetishes , no rituals , no hidden desire to be caught . a perfect vessel of evil , killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake . he ' d be immune to capture , wouldn ' t he ? your task forces , your forensics teams - they ' d be helpless .
i am . usually . i just . you should know , this is very unusual that i would do this so soon , in this day and age particularly , but . we just really hit it off . we did . and .
i ' m gon na go now . i won ' t tell <person> that anything happened .
i ' m sure you ' ll win , sir . everybody i know is going to vote for you . i was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy .
i ' ll tell you , <person> , i ' ve learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of general motors . <continued_utterance> <person> , what single thing would you want the next president of this country to do most ?
you know how to get back to the windmill , right ?
got it .
like what ?
in this case , she acts like she likes you when really she wants <person> to win .
yes , may i help you ?
i want to see <person> .
he was a mountain , all right . anchored the line for us little fellers .
chambers . y ' see the geese ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' d be nice . in your pa ' s paper .
he ' s as big as <person> , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he ' s probably <person> and <person> rolled into one .
<person> , and i never heard of him .
<person> got in the bath with her heated tongs ?
<person> taken a stack of pills ?
are you willing to betray your jedi friends ? without your co-operation i can do nothing to stop their execution .
what is to happen to me ? am i to be executed also ?
i just wanted to give her the pictures .
you took the pictures ? why would you do that ? we could get in a lot of trouble for that .
look at those eyes , look at those eyes . i know the color of your eyes .
<person> , come on .
just some tinnitus in my left ear -- <continued_utterance> i need to know what i don ' t know .
<person> ' s too short .
<person> ' t we all ? <continued_utterance> ever made your way as far into the interior as coruscant ?
once or twice .
<person> --
<person> , go back !
that would complicate things .
because i ' d be to blame , right ?
the government can decide to take an interest in people . people like your father with his struggling farm . it can discover things like unpaid property taxes . it can call in his equipment loans or tie him down for years in environmental litigation . on the other hand , it can pay him handsomely for mineral deposits he never knew were there . as distant and problematic as your relationship was , surely you ' d like the chance to do something for him .
those after images i saw . you never knew about them . they weren ' t part of <person> architecture , were they ?
he turned out all right .
i so wanted to believe <person> . but the thalaron radiation can ' t be explained away . whatever he ' s after , it ' s not peace .
shit . <person> .
he searches the dashboard frantically .
and i ' d take it in a second , norma -- only it ' s a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton , ohio .
these are nothing . you can have anything you want if you ' ll only stay . what is it you want -- money ?
<person> ' t flatter yourself .
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable .
seven years , and i ' ve still never been to a party where you weren ' t the one i wanted to hang with .
<person>-<person>-<person>my , how are ya ?
oops . <person> .
you golf ?
what about us ?
i ' m prepared to take the blame .
young man , it ' s none of my business , but maybe you should talk to someone . i myself have consulted a professional . i used to be up tight .
hypnotherapy . <person> . <person> of spouse support groups . <person> parent discussion nights . parents without partners . partners without parents . people who need people . guys who go into the woods , beat drums and bond . get a shrink . hug a friend . hug yourself . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t mind him . he ' s the guy who just lost his wife . what i really think is we need a change .
no , really , thanks .
you won ' t try it . i spent twenty minutes making it .
what ' s the matter , can ' t swim ?
i can swim . why ?
what did you do ?
tomorrow , mrs . <person> will have a boot on her car . fogell laughs his ass off .
now ?
i love you , <person> , beyond poetry .
come on , <person> . this is gon na be a big night . <person> ' t you feel it ? the energy in the air ? there ' s money to be made , dreams to sell .
<person> to peddle .
you ' re an asshole .
what ' s your point ?
you ' ll help me find a place ?
we ' ll help you find a place .
you think that ' s good they stopped ? it means they ' re comin ' for us ! to kill us !
<person> said .
like you cared about me three years ago ?
hey .
somebody ' s here . <continued_utterance> who is it ?
uhh . i ' m here for <person> .
i think i ' m going crazy , <person> . i really do . are you happily married ?
what ?
<person> ?
mexico . little place right on the pacific . you know what the mexicans say about the pacific ? they say it has no memory . that ' s where i ' d like to finish out my life , <person> . a warm place with no memory . open a little hotel right on the beach . buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new . take my guests out charter fishing . you know , a place like that , i ' d need a man who can get things .
even i get boarded sometimes . do you think i had a choice ?
you can tell that to <person> . he may only take your ship .
horizontal boosters . ! alluvial dampers . ! well that ' s not it . bring me the hydrospanners ! <continued_utterance> i don ' t know how we ' re going to get out of this one . <continued_utterance> oww ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> that was no laser blast ! something hit us .
<person> , get up here !
well , this one here comes off <person> ' s boat . matches all his others , worn equal and so on . but this one here . <continued_utterance> . comes off third cleat from the stern , port side . and it ' s brand new . unlike the rest .
and the next one . ?
that ' s impossible .
<person> ? can you hear me ?
c ' mon , you can do better than that .
you want the stuff tomorrow or don ' t ya ? it ' s gon na take hours just to clean it up . besides , <person> ' s still a hot item . where am i gon na be if he gets hit ?
oh , <person> , <person> said you was somethin ' to see today .
i ' ll never be as good as that mark , <person> .
take it easy , you won ' t lose him now . we had him <number> years ago when he decided to be somebody . believe me , i ' ve seen enough to know .
how many guys you conned in your life , <person> ?
well , of course this isn ' t california .
no , but it looks like i will get a chance to do some surfing anyway .
<person> , well , now , she goes out with a ' better class of people . <person> .
he ' s a businessman .
how many times have i got to tell you i was in insurance ? you think i can ' t smell a phoney policy when it ' s shoved under my nose ? sure , he helped <person> , but that was just insurance , his cover , because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed , <person> , <person> , i think you ' re their boy , their creature . you were like an advertising slogan for them : this is what we produce , the greatest conductor in the world . and you went along with it . the truth of the matter is , <person> , you didn ' t need to be a member of the <person> . i made a mistake when i asked you for your <person> number . i should ' ve asked you for your non- <person> number . just like some other well-known artists . <person> , put that record on . <person> puts on the record of the adagio from <person> ' s <person> . after a moment : <continued_utterance> do you know what that is ?
of course i know what that is .
do you know what you were kidnapped by ? <continued_utterance> mrs . <person> .
he doesn ' t want to hurt anybody . <person> leave him alone .
you ain ' t takin ' me . spider-man . who ever you are .
hey , creep ! <continued_utterance> try again .
according to <person> , the average guy carries around a hard-on two and a half hours out of every day . what are you gon na do ?
i ' ve got a few ideas .
hey , you going to watch or you going to do ?
<person> and see .
ugh , i couldn ' t deal with my sisters . it ' s like living in a heironymous bosch painting .
oh . i see . well , um , what happened to your mother , if i could ask ? i mean , <person> , that ' s an awful thing to ask . i ' m sorry . i don ' t mean to -- it ' s just that , i ' m --
<person> . <person> <person> . i ' m your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural <person> . <person> .
sounds a lot of run . so they sent the big guns to check up on me . we recruiting children now ?
we need to talk , just you and i .
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow . just the two of us . or just the one of us .

i lied .
i think they know you ' re one of those guys rare people can see them . you need to help them . each one of them . everyone wants to be heard . everyone .
what if they don ' t want help ? what if they ' re just angry and they want to hurt somebody ?
run ! yes . a jedi ' s strength flows from the force . but beware of the dark side . <person> . fear . aggression . the dark side of the force are they . easily they flow , quick to join you in a fight . if once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny , consume you it will , as it did obi-wan ' s apprentice .
<person> . is the dark side stronger ?
you don ' t like his friends .
. they all yell ' there goes the virgin queen ' or the ' ice princess ' , or some <continued_utterance> not with my mouth open .

agent <person> , do you want to tell me exactly what you mean detaining colonel hardwick and six of my cid staff . because that strikes me as a very peculiar idea of interagency liaison .

and if they succeed , humans won ' t make <person> with the vulcans tomorrow . as <person> i should be the one beaming down .

that ' s not me . i ' ve never felt people liked me for my connections . <person> star kid problems . none of those . the water boils . he dumps in pasta . <continued_utterance> but i never knew i was black in that racist way <number> till i was sixteen and came back here . <person> protected . white servants . after the divorce we moved to switzerland . my mother , brother and z . i don ' t feel american . i don ' t even feel black . i suppose that ' s very lucky for me even though <person> says there ' s no such thing as luck . just what you make .
so , what ? eleven ?
midnight .
it can . ordinary matter , like ours ? not affected . everything else , disintegrates . <continued_utterance> what i ' m saying is : <person> ' t trust anyone . find yourself a weapon of some sort .

remember the lingerie salesgirl ?
<person> for the yankees . i know him brother . and you ?
<person> .
but i did not deal with it , sir . i let it prevent me from helping my friend . does that make me a coward ?

the psychiatrist - dr . <person> .
the cannibal . <continued_utterance> yes , well . <person> , right . i ' m glad for the chance , sir , but - why me ?

and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart ?
you ' re a real rascal , <person> . i ' d certainly dislike you if i didn ' t like you . you ' re an amusing boy , but there isn ' t a drop of respect in you for anything alive - you ' re too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck . not that i don ' t sometimes feel that you yearn for something better . <continued_utterance> i don ' t mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance , as long as j . j . doesn ' t know . but don ' t do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine . <person> doesn ' t like this ; but , on the other hand , he does want to look at the column . after only a momentary struggle , he picks the column off the spike and reads .

the more you tighten your grip , <person> , the more star systems will slip through your fingers .
not after we demonstrate the power of this station . in a way , you have determined the choice of the planet that ' ll be destroyed first . since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base , i have chosen to test this station ' s destructive power . on your home planet of <person> .

we still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action . maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we ' re done .
well , i think we ' re reaching the point of diminishing returns here , right ? certainly it ' s learning more about us than we ' ll ever learn about it .
but why is it doing what it ' s doing ? given it ' s resources , it could have done anything . presented me with your double , and you with mine .
prove it . stand on one foot . <person> expressionlessly lifts one leg . <continued_utterance> cool ! my own terminator . this is great !

<person> is taking the extra fins off my board . i only need one to make a deep cut back . he is also putting some pockets to slip my feet into so when i flip upside down , i don ' t lose the board .
<person> upside down ?
you ' re a real rascal , <person> . i ' d certainly dislike you if i didn ' t like you . you ' re an amusing boy , but there isn ' t a drop of respect in you for anything alive - you ' re too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck . not that i don ' t sometimes feel that you yearn for something better . <continued_utterance> i don ' t mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance , as long as j . j . doesn ' t know . but don ' t do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine . <person> doesn ' t like this ; but , on the other hand , he does want to look at the column . after only a momentary struggle , he picks the column off the spike and reads .
who put this item in about the comic ? `` if there ' s a more hilarious funny man around than <person> at the palace , you ' ll have to pardon us for not catching the name . we were too busy screaming . `` does this temple have a press agent ?

that wasn ' t in there before .
<person> , don ' t panic . remember what we talked about ? experience ?
what ?
<person> enough . a rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long . looks like a miniature pickaxe , with a small sharp pick on one end , and a blunt hammerhead on the other . it ' s for rocks .
rocks . <continued_utterance> <person> ?

<person> ?

your father thought that heavy snow was <person> ' s kindness . despite the hardship , it brought us beauty . <continued_utterance> . and reminded us . of our place in things . <continued_utterance> you don ' t believe in <person> anymore .

i ' m afraid i haven ' t time to listen .
it ' s so simple , too . a couple of fellows meet accidentally , like you and me . no connection between them at all . <person> saw each other before . each of them has somebody he ' d like to get rid of , but he can ' t murder the person he wants to get rid of . he ' ll get caught . so they swap murders .

i just don ' t .
will you let me out of here ?
frankly , captain , we ' re disappointed .
i wouldn ' t have called the boy exactly balanced .
<person> was not . unbalanced when i married him . and he was not . ' indifferent to women ' no matter what they said !
that ' s so beautiful .
i beg your pardon ?
i ' m not upset . why would i be upset ?
look if the truth is you don ' t feel like talking about this right now that ' s fine . but don ' t look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me . <person> there are only so many lies you ' re allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face . you wind up looking like . she stops . it ' s just too horrible .
what ' s not right ?
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that . just like you questioned him .
it makes me feel better .
does she ever answer back ?
you think so ?
you got ta give <person> one thing . he ' s good with the ladies .
forget it ? are you crazy ? let me see it . <continued_utterance> jeez . you idiot . take this off .

<person> , i wan na talk to you .
<person> , you really made some impression with <person> . she can ' t get over you .
how do you draw now ?
i draw people with smiles , dogs running , and rainbows . they don ' t have meetings about rainbows .
so do i .
<person> on back . let me show you where it fits in . she reaches in a drawer for her notes on <person> .
come on , we ' re late .
what ? what time is it ?
. they all yell ' there goes the virgin queen ' or the ' ice princess ' , or some <continued_utterance> not with my mouth open .
<person> girl . <continued_utterance> and what do you do wh .
<person> . the letters .
' seems like you ' re favoring the japs , <person> . <person> ' all about their patriotism and loyalty with nothin ' ' bout the treachery . ' a smile in the voice . a sad one . <continued_utterance> ' your newspaper is an insult to all white americans . please cancel my subscription and send refund . ' now the smile is on his face . even sadder . <continued_utterance> the calls are better . ' jap lovers get their balls cut off and stuffed down their . ' missed the rest . hanging up will do that . <continued_utterance> we lost the price-rite ads . and <person> ' s shop , and <person> ' s <person> and the anacortes cafe . and <number> percent of our subscribers .
oil .
<person> . ?
which way do you want to go ? <continued_utterance> you can go that way . that way . that way .
that way .
yes .
anything you didn ' t understand ?
why did he lick the mailbox ?
i don ' t know . maybe he had ocd and he was obsessed with licking mailboxes .
. do you know they ' ve ignored me for about a year .
i didn ' t know ?
i ' m teaching him . i heard you have a new girlfriend .
we broke up . there were problems .
it doesn ' t mean you shouldn ' t be prepared . you didn ' t even bring one ?
no . that wasn ' t the plan ! we had a plan ! i can ' t believe you did that without even consulting me about it !
<person> ?
. and let us know how it ' s going .
<person> : let ' s page five , the fucking horse dies . you know , she could be in the movie , she could , she ' s got a good face , she could be the doctor ' s . uh , why does it have to be his , uh , wife . ? it could be his .
<person> , <person> , stick to the business , will you ?
<person> soulsby .
<person> . nice to meet you .
how would i you prick i haven ' t seen you for four years .
fuck you !
you ' ll have every bug in christendom -
let me - paul takes the dishes .
i gave <person> two sovereigns for <person> !
you did . but <person> and the admiral ' s men have the playing of it as the rose .
i ' m gon na go for pilot .
<person> for you . we need every pilot we can get .
but you figured you ' d get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help - is that it ? the truth ? <person> has him pegged . but:
<person> , i ' m the one who took the call . <person> was acting under the assumption that i ' d already checked the guy out . we ' re both to blame .
i don ' t care . oy . <person> . . . <continued_utterance> i know she ' ll never see him after this weekend . she can ' t commit either .
he does sound fun . <continued_utterance> admit it , he ' s got something . you felt it , right ?
uh-huh .
why don ' t you two hold it ? <continued_utterance> do you feel longing ?
no . no . and we must say `` goodbye . `` i don ' t work here anymore . she then talks spanish to cristina . admonishing her not to embarrass them . something about <person> being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity . but it is said with total calm .
do i have to get out ?
it ' s the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve outrun imperial starships , not the local bulk-cruisers , mind you . i ' m talking about the big corellian ships now . she ' s fast enough for you , old man . what ' s the cargo ?
only passengers . <person> , the boy , two droids , and no questions asked .
<person> , i ' d like to turn myself in . dereliction of duty by an officer during wartime .
and you freely admit to it ?
no , <person> ! you can ' t come with me !
<person> , you take your little brother out to play with you !
so , don ' t ask me . i ' m worried about my own kid there .
you don ' t have to worry about bernice . nothing is going to change that heart .
minneapolis . minneapolis .
what are you doing ? <continued_utterance> . what ' s that ?
what is it ?
poached salmon .
<person> rule of the sea . we don ' t bother each other , stick to ourselves . ask anybody .
now if you wanted to kill a man . think you ' d try boarding against his will , and hitting him with a fishing gaff ?
i asked <person> but she was busy tonight and you ' re the next best thing . i mean , it isn ' t that you ' re the next best thing but because you play her , it feels comforting . does that make sense ? although the thing is offstage you ' re nothing like her . you play her very well though . did <person> mention what she was doing tonight because i called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn ' t going to be back till late and i thought that was weird because she told me <person> was sick .
she ' s going to dinner with <person> .
oh i can see you ' ve had a bad day . we ' ll see the house another time , okay ?
no ! no ! i ' m sorry . ninety-seven five right ?
i ' m going to visit my sister for a few days . i ' d like you to get your stuff out .
what about <person> ?
who was it ?
it ' s going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship .
with all respect for your expertise , sir . we ' re on track here .
<person> is what i said to the president -- the army is not some big green police department . <person> with the man on the ground .
it literally is genesis .
the power of creation --
skiddy and <person> ? i haven ' t seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape .
they ' ve got two monsters now . both boys .
when an alibi is full of bourbon , sir , it can ' t stand up .
you mean the professor was boiled ?
hey there , men . is your mother home a-tall ?
sheriff moran , hullo .
you know , even i get boarded sometimes , <person> . i had no choice , but i ' ve got a charter now and i can pay you back , plus a little extra . i just need some more time .
put your blasters away . <person> , my boy , i ' m only doing this because you ' re the best and i need you . so , for an extra , say twenty percent i ' ll give you a little more time . but this is it . if you disappoint me again , i ' ll put a price on your head so large you won ' t be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life .
gon na lose some inventory .
selfish bastard .
he knows .
what about her briefing ? the strategy session -- she said the cells don ' t know about each other , that they -- devereaux ignores him . turns to sharon .
<person> bastard . i never get it .
you have to dial when <person> says `` if '' . `` if you want the chance to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire . `` that ' s when they open the lines . <continued_utterance> that ' s what <person> in technical says . he put the system in .
we ought to work out some kind of protocol .
for what ?
it ' s like soccer . you play soccer ?
soccer ? no . baseball .
well , i think it ' s perfect . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
i ' ll make you another when i ' m done .
our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged .
he can ' t go to the ribbon . so he ' s trying to make the ribbon come to him . <person> , is it going to pass near any m-class planets ?
so am i -- ! hey , <person> . tell us about being a spook ? ever meet <person> ? <person> ' t you at the bay of pigs ?
you were in charge of waco , right -- ? or was that <person> ?
<person> what ? <person> ' s unconscious .
no , he isn ' t .
<person> ' t you know ?
i know there ain ' t a dirty trick you wouldn ' t play to get what you want .
i didn ' t want to say anything .
why ?
<person> ? you okay ?
i couldn ' t . oh , god . you . came here . to stop me ?
why ?
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle .
why ?
you know . where ' s your bathroom ?
but if they changed history .
we were caught in the temporal wake from the vortex . it must have protected us from any changes in the time-line .
that ' s nice . and you live in queens ? with a child , and a dog . ?
no dog .
you got an <number> -track tape player on purpose , just ' cause you knew the only thing they had on <number> -track was fuckin ' opera .
it was a clearance .
<person> . it was funny . but it cost me money .
come on , amigo , the world ' s full of marks . and nobody knows how to work ' em like you do , pal . you could sell a goddamn rat ' s asshole for a wedding ring ! let me buy you a drink .
you got ta get another tour . we ' re gettin ' too old for this .
i ' m sorry .
he thinks it could be made into something .
into what ? a lampshade ?
back , i suppose , slowly as i can .
you like jazz !
i have to find a way to get to soran .
<person> , klingon vessel decloaking directly ahead . <continued_utterance> they are hailing .

speaking of which .
he ' s here somewhere . find him . the sub ' s on it ' s way . go ! c ' mon ! <continued_utterance> how can he be missing ?
sir , about leaving --
which i told <person> was attacking --
it ' s his fear . the squid . he ' s manifesting his fears . making them real .
<person> , he sounded nice .
oh ? oh , really ? now we ' re getting down to it .
leave that to me . send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed !
<person> vader , the battle station plans are not aboard this ship ! and no transmissions were made . an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting , but no life forms were aboard .
yeah , so ?
it ' s fucking blood .
i know how real this must seem to you , but it ' s not . this isn ' t really your house . we ' ve both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus .
<person> weed . <continued_utterance> there ' s a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left , right behind the nutmeg .
<person> . security ' s been our biggest worry . now that you ' re here we can shut this thing down tight .
from what ? what ' s with all the security ?
the main floor stays public . the side rooms we try to keep available for special functions like tonight .
it ' s terrific win .
<person> . the truth is that i ' m afraid you ' re going to ki . leave me .
i ' m going to `` cleave you ? '' what does that mean ?
you can ' t do what ?
it isn ' t right . i can ' t . i . i know i si . i , they , i don ' t know if they told me it was in the con .
<person> , now and again .
<person> , yeah , i know where i fucking know you from . you used to go out with <person> ?

he was right . you don ' t want your money in a bank .

a pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match ! it ' s a new wrinkle to tell the truth . i never thought i ' d make a killing on some guy ' s `` integrity '' .
full of beans , ain ' t you ? but you know that you ' ll stand or fall by what you ' re doing now .
and i ' m supposed to figure out what because i ' m a housekeeper and you don ' t have to think .
oh , don ' t do the class thing , man . you don ' t know where i come from .
<person> . the last writer ' s retreat i stayed at kind of froze my balls off , you know ?
oh .

hey .

m mprh . mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm . mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm .
<person> well , then . i will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started . but you <person> , must remain dead .

<person> up , soldier . <continued_utterance> the train is just the beginning . our intel says there are more attacks are coming today . and they ' re linked with the train . time is of the essence . do you understand ? <continued_utterance> captain ?
what do you want to do ?
i don ' t know .
well , now that ' s just what i asked -- but all he said , was that it belonged to a good friend . then he said he wasn ' t waitin ' fer the next coach , but was ridin ' over to see the district judge about it alone .
that ' s when they got him .
we looking for you . how you sleep ?
i slept fine . i decided i ' m not my father . i don ' t run out on the people i care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta ' s at me .
' <person> , please . i do not speak english . ' what is hitchhike ?
you want this ticket ?
your lawyer ain ' t going to help you . want to guess ' why ' ? y ' understand the picture .
. ohmigod .
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives , their struggles . here are people doing the most important job in the world , and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes . to me it can be as exciting as any chase , any gunplay .
<person> .
i suppose it ' s in its usage .
how about `` <person> you ' re a douche bag for kissing <person> ? ''
well . under the circumstances .
if i can ever repay your kindness . it would be my great pleasure . <continued_utterance> . and your ms . <person> ? a remarkable young woman .
<person> . <continued_utterance> `` <person> with the word clitoris '' !
wow !
. and , and , and did she ? and she did the seven shows ?
no , she didn ' t <person> . but i think you should do the scene .
with the marauder ' s visual capabilities , all you have to do is look at something to hit it , so you will exercise extreme care on my firing line . do you get me ?
sir , yes , sir !
yes . the goat ' s come into heat .
has it ?
come again ?
just do it . i knew they wouldn ' t let me die . at least you can make me forget all of this . i hope . <continued_utterance> what are you waiting for ? you ' re just doing your job . i ' d do the same thing if i was you . at least you ' ve got a shot at saving those people on the bridges .
what do you want from me ? there are no cars on this road . i didn ' t ask for this stupid storm . <continued_utterance> what are you saying ?
you can stop . i will go on alone .
please ! quiet , please !
just tell me one thing ! how many of them are there and are they armed ?
you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere , you remember that -- when the sphere opened ? that ' s right . but you can ' t remember going inside , can you ? no , of course not . <person> couldn ' t either , could he ? `` like everything ' s on the tip of my tongue '' , he said .
that ' s bullshit .
we ' re leaving , okay ? these guys could kill us . you want to get killed for liquor ?
you ' re really gon na bail on me ? !
sex killers act alone . so there ' s no information on the street , which is how cases get made . cops know they ' ll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene . <continued_utterance> and anyway , nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker . they ' re roadkill . <continued_utterance> see , it ' s all about what they see walking in . a dead hooker , handcuffs , penetration . they ' ll see a trick gone wrong . <person> kill . the kind you never solve .
but that doesn ' t add , does it .
did my father send you ?
. that ' s right .
you went through <person> ' things ?
he ' s not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking <person> .
it ' s called <person> . <person> and eurydice . <person>- that one there- is looking for his lover , eurydice . she died , but he can ' t live without her . <continued_utterance> the pain is so bad that he goes to the underworld- the place we go when we die- to try to get her back .
you can ' t do that . can you ?
of course .
tell him the fbi is after him .
me , i don ' t care . <person> ? she ' s already half dead .
yes . about that , you are right .
you told me to .
you have to do what i say ? !
eighty-eight sassicaia .
wow . we got ta give it a moment , but this is tasty . really good . how about you ?
yes . i like . many new things . <person> different .
i bet . you ' ve traveled a long way , huh ? god must have something special in mind for you . <continued_utterance> what happened there ?
<person> ? <continued_utterance> she has materialized from your memory of her . what was her name ?
rheya .
i love you .
you love me ? ! i thought we decided not to fall in love . that we would be forced to live a lie .
<person> ?
hi , <person> . <person> , this is <person> .
why are you so into <person> ? it ' s like a thing with you .
i don ' t know . it ' s a hard grape to grow . as you know . it ' s thin-skinned , temperamental , ripens early . it ' s not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected . <person> needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world . and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really , can tap into <person> ' s most fragile , delicate qualities . only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can <person> be coaxed into its fullest expression . and when that happens , its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet . <continued_utterance> i mean , cabernets can be powerful and exalting , but they seem prosaic to me for some reason . by comparison . how about you ?
well , some of the children just don ' t respond to <number> step programs .
then we ' ll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization .
oh , what a mess . <person> , do you think you can repair him ?
<person> ' s got people who can fix him .
you certainly do .
i ' d really like to see what you ' re working on . unless you ' re worried i won ' t like it .
oh . <person> . <person> found myself wondering what was inside that truck .
<person> , i ' m going to ask you to hand me the keys to your vehicle , please .
can ' t we just be friends , <person> ?
sure .
up the stairs !
suppose you listen just for a minute -
may i ask a question ?
sure .
i had a good time . i think you ' re a very nice person . really .
that is just the wrong thing to say right now , <person> . you should go .
so you ' re going to stop acting ?
no way . this would just provide some stability is what i ' m saying . i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there , you know , keep myself in the game in case something big comes along .
now i ' ve got another lie to live down . thanks , <person> .
i ' m trying to get you some action , but you ' ve got to help me out just a little bit .
<person> ' you always have to dress like a fuckin ' pimp ?
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe .
what you lookin ' at ?
we looking for you . how you sleep ?
where does <person> live ?
we passed it a few blocks back , where the police were . the palazzo gioia . they don ' t even know i ' m in rome and i ' m not going to incriminate <person> -
i got ta remember to have that fixed . there you are , i ' ve been looking for you all over town .
what happened ?
<person> , well , you should be my agent .
if i was , i would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin . now <person> , why didn ' t you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man ? look how i ' m dressed . i ' ve got to run and put my face on .
that got you talking about depositions and lawyers . by the time <person> came back from the washroom and <person> came in with her tea and cookies , you were going on about how tough it would be for me to answer some of the questions those other lawyers would ask .
they work for the people we ' re trying to sue . their job is to try to minimize damages . our job , <person> , is to try to maximize them . you have to think of it that way . as people doing their jobs . no good guys or bad guys . just our side and their side .
not in those words .
so the defendant was encouraged to hope . or could have been .
they are insane . wives , husbands , children , love , marriage , relationship . it ' s all insane .
that ' s what i ' m afraid of . did i tell you that my perfect sister and her perfect husband are getting a perfect divorce- ?
like me , it has been designed with modular power sources .
<person> , if you please .
<person> . this is scrambled . <person> .
<person> . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
sure , we talk the same language .
i ' m glad you enjoyed it . i thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself .
but you played the big con . you said it was nothin ' . a game for flakes and mama ' s boys .
and i ' m tellin ' ya now , you ' re a fool if you don ' t get into it . a bigger fool than i was . i been lookin ' for this one all my life , <person> . now i got a chance to step out at the top .
i tested positive .
yes .
soon . it ' s just hard to find the time .
it ' s pretty .
words .
what kind of words ?
no , nothing . i ' m just thinking about when <person> arrived in mongi . and now look at you .
<person> at me what ?
you did not ! ! ! <continued_utterance> you can have all the <person> .
i ' m taking ' <person> ' and <person> ' s <person> .
they turned you down ?
they went for someone with more theme park experience . i woulda killed for that job . <continued_utterance> see , it ' s all how you look at it . if your life sucks , then mine is god awful . i mean , i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing . you got in the union , you got an agent . i thought if you could make it , maybe i could too .
we are lost .
no , it will turn out well .
try it on . <continued_utterance> please try it on ? <continued_utterance> just try it on ?
just try it on .
you need to get glasses .
no , i don ' t -- you have them . here ' s <person> . `` my dearest <person> , i wake consumed with thoughts of you -- ''
<person> , we already .
well , fine , fine . <person> da dee . and how ' s it working ?
so . wide cross-section of men to evaluate . and the day that the defendant volunteered for this . demonstration . did you find him eager ?
more than eager . he was out to make a point . hooks finds that interesting . begins to pace .
no , i mean the killer ' s got some kind of distortion in his visual cortex . the color and gray-scale values are all messed up , like color blindness . <continued_utterance> <person> , you see the peak period ratios there ? could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something . some kind of trauma this is not good . i don ' t like this at all .
what ?
now we can ' t just let him go . america has to stand tall in the world yadda yadda yadda . so what we do is . we let the american justice system do its work .
-- <person> . ?
i hurt you ?
what happened to his finger ?
<person> !
mine ! <continued_utterance> mine !
that is both impudent and untrue . tell me , how did you feel when you viewed our <person> ' s latest effort ? or should i say , his `` next-to-latest '' ?
by the book , he ' s a sadist .
anything . you ' re lying on your side , asleep , i could . stick a needle in your ear .
<person> !
um . my french teacher . mrs . <person> .
can i do it ?
who do you think ?
i think you haven ' t decided yet .
i ' ll miss you so much .
<person> . that ' s very good . <continued_utterance> what you ' re grown-up enough to know . is that people . can do <continued_utterance> when you ' re in trouble . have me there . when you fall in love . have me there . you can . <continued_utterance> that ' s how we go on , you know . forever . <person> someone takes us along . <continued_utterance> on your wedding night . when your babies are born . i want to be there . will you take me ?
she don ' t work here no more . i ' m fillin ' in for a couple days .
where you goin ' ?
what is it ? are you buzzed ?
no . i gave up drinking weeks ago . yes . <person> noticed -- which shows i probably conducted myself pretty well as a drunk . but duty called and i ' m sober so may i say just one thing .
well . mostly .
my god !
<person> ' s bullshit , huh , <person> ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' wax off , asshole !
no . i ' m helping you , man ! just listen .
oh , <person> . you know , i left my wallet over in my locker . i ' ll see you before we leave and get it to you then .
<person> , sure .
but not that way .
but we .
i want to get money for you and the baby .
i don ' t need any money for the baby . i ' ll be fine .
you ' re crazy .
<person> will help us .
do you have life support ?
for the moment . but we ' re dead in the water .
are you sure , <person> ?
what did he say ?
you got ta diamond and it doesn ' t belong to you , it belongs to my colleague here .
that ' s what i love about you <person> , no small talk .
yeah . <person> . you know . people smile , right ? watch . goes to the order window . <continued_utterance> hi . nice place you got here . how ' s business ?
gim me a break .
well he ' s got her in a tizzy , i ' ll tell you that !

as a matter of fact , i ' m not going direct . i ' m stopping off . at <person> .
<person> ? what would anybody want to go there for ?
that ' s great .
<person> remains . are they still here ?
everything .
<person> day .

but he could be reporting back to your brother , couldn ' t he ?
there ' s this theory he gave his wife syphilis , right ? no evidence but the symptoms fit . the poor woman gets kind of eccentric and moves her bed up to their attic -
the bastard -
i don ' t know anything about bodies ! i mean , he didn ' t bring it home . he was good to me . sometimes . he was sweet . he took care of me . who am i supposed to go out with ? he owns a casino . he let me sing .

i didn ' t know <person> was in town .
i saw him at <person> ' s
i look forward to seeing <person> again . i ' ve thought about it every day since i left . it ' s by far the most beautiful place i ' ve ever seen .
you were just a little boy then . it may not be as you remember it ; time changes your perception .
well . compared . <continued_utterance> your wife was in a red <person> which went through a guardrail over the chesapeake bay bridge . <continued_utterance> they were doin ' <number> in a fog . the <continued_utterance> car was cut in half by the impact with the rail . her male companion ' s body floated up downstream .

i am speaking for the president .
when i last saw you , i was unprepared . i did not know what to expect . in these past weeks , i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . you have to understand who i am and what i am . i am a musician and i believe in music . i am an artist and i believe in art . <person> in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man ' s spiritual needs . i must confess , however , to being extremely naive . i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . my entire life was devoted to music because , and this is very important , because i thought that i could , through music , do something practical .
and what was that ?
hi , <person> .
hi , <person> .
. we don ' t have thirteen at table .
<person> , <person> , the director .
she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .
my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex . is she fertile ?
constantly . without doubt . and plays the lute , she has a natural ear . and her bosom -- did i mention her bosom ?
what of her bosom ?
<person> , i got to talk to you , it ' s serious .

<person> fifty kilometers .
entering the upper ionospere .

you ' re wondering why i held it .
i ' m wondering how the judge is gon na like my waking up his old bones . in the middle of the night . <continued_utterance> your daddy . was quite a feller .
pure , unadulterated , egyptian cotton .
you ' re saying they ' re egyptian ?
no . i can not .
i ' ve deactivated the sensory inputs . that flesh on your body is just meat , now .
i don ' t understand .
maybe you should get off . are you okay ?
<person> ' t make any assumptions about our friendship , <person> .

some , you were , you were going to make a reservation for us ? where ' s my schedule ? where are we booked tonight ?
my wife ' s having a baby .
i ' m afraid i ' m not quite sure , sir .
help me , obi-wan <person> .

no . the person is gone . it ' s weird `cuz we ' re connected to them in this strangely intimate way . but we never actually meet them . it ' s just kind of weird . <continued_utterance> i have seen a dead body once though .
where are we ?
open your eyes .
with id and a gun . ? impersonating a federal agent is a felony .
he ' s going to kill her , mr . <person> . this morning , or maybe at noon , but today , and belvedere ' s our last chance . i ' m flying there , right now , unless you stop me . you want my id ? <person> - take it .
-- no excuses . this is unacceptable behavior . you guys need to learn discipline .
you need to remember that you still have a long way to go , a lot of hard work ahead of you before you make it . first , there ' s getting your shot in the american minor leagues : rookie ball , single , double , triple a - all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark . so , you better pull it together quick .
it is dangerous , senorita .
but if we get through we ' ll beat them to the k . c .
who ' s a killer ?
that fella <person> looks like a killer to me .
<person> ! that ' s perfect , `cause , <person> , didn ' t you just say that you heard about a party ?
why didn ' t you tell me ?
you know how many she makes ?
it ' s a skill , she ' s proud of it . and she brings her dolls along . and she looks good in blue . and she wears a key for a good luck charm .
what ' s wrong with you guys ?
shut up , <person> . never mind . <person> ' ll tell you next year .
what else you got on his followers .
clearly , they ' re committed .
i guess i ' d better get it right the first time .
the borg will undoubtedly attack . set phasers to rotating modulation . the security officers check their phasers and wait as <person> and worf finish putting on their suits . <person> straps a tool case to his suit .
it ' s a good job . you know how many guys would kill for your job ?
i ' m smarter than that , i know i am .

you might have oversold it .
kind of twirl the ball around in your hand . <person> . it doesn ' t hurt , does it ?
if you didn ' t kill him , then who did ?
who can say . ? best thing for him , really . his therapy was going nowhere .
if you choose to face <person> , you will do it alone . i can not interfere .
i understand . <person> , fire up the converters .
you know , you could work in a wine store .
<person> , that would be a good move . <continued_utterance> are you chewing gum ?
<person> , i ' m sorry it had to be your unit on <person> . that mission had a very low survival probability .

of course you do . if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people . you ' d be sitting where i am now . at least i hope you would .
<person> , please stop .
she wanted me to tell you , she saw you dance . <continued_utterance> she said when you were little , you and her had a fight right before your dance recital . you thought she didn ' t come to see you dance . she did . <continued_utterance> she hid in the back so you wouldn ' t see . she said you were like an angel . <continued_utterance> she said , you came to her where they buried her . asked her a question . she said the answer is `` everyday . `` <continued_utterance> what did you ask ?
i hope that j . j . really likes <person> , that it isn ' t an act .
why should he put on an act ? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do !
the web faced weirdo . he is a joke in a halloween costume . don ' t make me laugh . he tears up peter ' s spidey photos . <continued_utterance> now get out of here and don ' t come back without something i can use !

<person> . the man you want to volunteer to help elect president .

seven years .
this scam we got going here was your <continued_utterance> brainstorm , <person> . i admit , i thought it was a rotten idea , but i put up the scratch . and now we got a beautiful thing .
i suggest you try it again , luke . <continued_utterance> this time , let go your conscious self and act on instinct .
with the blast shield down , i can ' t even see . how am i supposed to fight ?
bases <person> . there ' s a <number> o-page outline .

i guess i left it in my room .
he wanted to be us . everything we are in the world , this paltry thing -- our life -- he wanted it . he stabbed himself to get into our lives . he envied us . we ' re not enough to be envied .
like the papers said . we have hearts .

i wanted to tell you . that first day . that ' s why i --
you knew this whole time ?

something ' s up wi .
i ' m happy to be alive but it ' s like this door has been opened . i don ' t think i was naive . but everything is different now .
you ' ll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it .
i ' ve been there for almost a year . i only planned on stay with her for a few weeks , but she gets upset every time i say i ' m moving .
you were close as kids ?
i have ?
you re sort of . radiant . your eyes are shining . you ' re rea <number> ly different . <continued_utterance> you ' re . you ' re a nun .
forty-eight hours -- and you ' ll be a free woman .
<person> . that ' s good to hear .
i ' m going to `` cleave you ? '' what does that mean ?
leave me . not `` cleave me . `` reject me . and so i decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by .
ten it is .
i ' ll see what i can do . but it ' s a waste of money .
i ' m sorry .
what ? ! but all our paperwork ' s there . my school records , <person> ' s football records .
call the police ! !
hey buddy . let her go .
first she turns off the tv , then she says it .
she knew we were listening .
you are . i joined up to get out on my own . and you had to tag along .
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
. <person> has been wiped of the earth . nothing lives in what was once called the latin paradise .
aw , <person> , geez . it ' s home .
i ' m just as human as you . i see , i hear , i touch , and i feel just like you do .

he can ' t manifest .
no , he can ' t .
second generation , huh ?
third . <person> did stunt work for <person> . i come from a picture family . naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star . so i had ten years of dramatic lessons , diction , dancing . then the studio made a test . well , they didn ' t like my nose -- it slanted this way a little . i went to a doctor and had it fixed . they made more tests , and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn ' t like my acting .
i don ' t dispute that in the wrong hands --
would you like to tell me whose are the
you don ' t believe that i miss your words . i get three or four tops . and then just see your mouth moving with nothing coming out and then i spin out and there ' s this noise . but there ' s no way to miss a `` yes '' or `` no . ``
yes .
something i want ?
if we could change something in your life , anything at all , what would you like that to be ? <continued_utterance> you don ' t have to answer now .
<person> .
the one in the hat ? she ' s cute .
if you didn ' t want me chasing him , you shouldn ' t have taken me to that funeral home . <continued_utterance> <person> is still the key , i know he is . whatever he told me about <person> is just as good now as it was before .
or just as worthless . but i want you in memphis , close to him . maybe when he gets tired of toying with <person> , he ' ll talk to you again . there ' s a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip .
i don ' t know . i thought <person> was kind of cute .
<person> , you ' re new , so let me tell you how things are . first those guys were wearing blue shorts . that means <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number> concessions . the water world social structure is organized on three levels . at the bottom are the trash rats .
they ' re just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old <person> of prey is any match for the federation flagship .
or perhaps they ' re on the surface .
<person> badge , snyder . <person> ' t cut much up here .
i ' m lookin ' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap . thought he mighta come in here .
of course . <person> , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing <person> to select a program ?
but . wait a minute .
thing is , see . . i don ' t read all that good .
well . you ' ve come to the right place then . <continued_utterance> . and the lamplight o ' er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor . and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor , shall be lifted nevermore ! ``

<person> knew somebody was after her .
she said `` if they get me '' . they . <person> means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover , which means somebody whacked her for a reason .
yeah . this is a really good pillow .
um .
i understand , mister . it means something , really .

oh , maybe another time . . so . i guess i should ' ve seen your play , then i would ' ve <person> how this ended .
<person> , big twist , huh ? so what are you doing over here , man ?
<person> .
hey , he was going to kill you . and this ratfuck paid to have <person> killed , to save his own sorry ass . <continued_utterance> you shut the fuck up , right now , i ' m gon na pull this fuckin ' trigger ! <continued_utterance> look , baby , it ' s now of never . the guy is a known input junkie , so a little od won ' t surprise anybody . it ' s the only way we can be together . you know it ' s true .
you fixed my suit ?
you don ' t trust me ?
. after you clear this zone here , rendezvous behind this ridge where <person> and <person> should be held .
<person> .

are you going to make me beg ? <continued_utterance> what is that ?
going somewhere , <person> ?
yes , greedo . as a matter of fact , i was just going to see your boss . tell <person> that i ' ve got his money .
for how long ?
' til they pick up the perp . seniority gets day shift . you know what that means .
where do you think they are , they ' re in bed ?
what ' s wrong with you ?
i received a telegram from <person> informing me that he had made me a privy councillor . i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse . after the dreadful events of november <number> , the violent attacks on the jews , i stopped using the title .
what about vice-president of the chamber of music , you used that title didn ' t you ? but then i suppose you had no choice there either , because i suppose dr . <person> just sent you a telegram saying , <person> mr . vice-president .
yeah well i didn ' t expect them to lock us up in here did i ?
ohh your one clever bastard <person> , you really are . where is it ?
i ' m pretty busy , as you can see .

well . under the circumstances .
everyone be seated , please .
<person> , a lot of people showed up .
off and on . it ' s not uncommon for our guests to vanish for months at a time .
i ran the name through our database , just to be sure . there ' s never been an agent <person> o ' ryan in the bureau .
yeah .
agh ! ! i want to know where you heard these horrific obscenities !
talk to me .
is <person> working today ?
<person> . ? <person> . ?

ice cold water .

that <person> ' s on to him .
she didn ' t have one picture of <person> . not one . even cut him out of the old yearbooks . and she had a basement door like a vault . she ' s hiding something . in the basement of her house . what is it , ten minutes away from here ? her house .
if she ' s under our protection and something happens to her house , her belongings , the department could be liable . there could be a lawsuit .

you can see it . but you can never get there without our help .
get there ? what do you mean ?
there ' s more to this whole thing than you think .
<person> mean ?
we were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after .
yep . the jokes on us .
i just know a couple lines .
yes , you may have a drink . what would you like ?
i have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely . in staying here , i believed i walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows . you seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t directly oppose the <person> because i told myself , that was not my job . if i had taken any active part in politics i could not have remained here . but as a musician , i am more than a citizen . i am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies . i know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of buchenwald and auschwitz than words .
have you ever smelled burning flesh ? i smelt it four miles away . four miles away , i smelt it . have you ever seen the gas chambers , the crematoria ? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses ? you talk to me about culture , art and music ? you putting that in the scales , <person> ? you setting culture , art and music against the millions put to death by your pals ? they had orchestras in the camps . they played <person> , <person> . the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families . i don ' t understand the germans ' relationship with music . what do you need music for ? your pals you could call to save a few <person> when millions of them were being annihilated ? yes , i blame you for not getting hanged , i blame you for your cowardice . you strutted and swaggered , you fucking piece of shit , king-pin in a shithouse . you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows , and i say to you , lies !
can i ask you one other thing ? what ' s with the turtlenecks ? it ' s the middle of summer .
now seriously , why do you care what i wear ?
and professor rosomorf and crazy ock .
what about <person> ? is he there with them ?
<person> , keep moving , a step at a time !
we have to go back .
she ' s shore a pretty thing .
<person> ' t know how i could help her -- even if i wanted to -- i don ' t know any thing about this <person> -- or <person> -- or --
sometimes i get boners so big i can ' t hide them . and then i get nervous and my heart starts pounding , and it all just , like , feeds my boner . it just becomes this . thing . that ' s attached to me . and it won ' t go away .
just imagine if girls weren ' t weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em , like this shit .
yeah , people like you . <person> . gung-ho people like you . and you know what i mean . people like you are either runners or chasers .
you are a trip , <person> . <continued_utterance> okay . i guess i ' m running and chasing .
show me our current position . <continued_utterance> how long until we reach the fleet ?
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector <number> in approximately <number> minutes .
oh poor you - was it awful ?
bloody terrible . <person> ' t move till well past chiswick . but look , i nipped into fortnums .
you think he killed <person> ?
yes , i do . <person> ' s out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier .
how ' s that about your being my friend ?
<person> ' t you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach ? once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut , you ' re through .
what do you think you ' re doing ?
i ' m going to the masquerade . it ' s <person> tonight <person> , aren ' t you coming to the school ball ? whoa , you could go without an outfit .
he ' s dead , isn ' t he . <person> might just as well have died before you were born .
<person> , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late .
we got the permit .
is that one hell of a kid ?
thank you .
hey , ol ' buddy !
you think this is all very funny .
a little .
are you sure these are the coordinates ?
captain , this is the garden spot of <person> --
<person> doesn ' t care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus .
what ' s the `` nexus '' ?
of course . no <person> . what do you want ? what ' s my life worth to you ?
nothing . and everything . this is deeper than money . <person> up . <person> is done . <person> is over . understand that . you are over . just shut the fuck up .
um . not exactly . but i ' ve been honest . i haven ' t told her i ' m available . and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days . besides .
besides what ?
if we ' re gon na be a team , why not be a real team ?
there ' s a war on . i want a command , i want my own ship , you do , too .
has anyone spoken to them yet ?
the admiral ' s going over the tapes they brought up now .
you think i ' d really drink that ?
you don ' t think i put something in it , do you ?
. no , sir . it has not .
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life , wouldn ' t you say ?
what ' s in it for me ?
come on . these guys are serious . help me out . my ass is on the line , too , you know .
are you crazy -- ?
you are an associate of <person> .
my luck has run out . <person> today i have never had to bury a friend .
i ' m sorry , <person> .
well . i guess so .
all right .
<person> ' s better at the bar . <person> , <person> and beyond .
rose- <person> . nice to meet you .
you ' re a moron , kid . you guessed the wrong secret . <continued_utterance> <person> used to be a colleague at random house . i ' m crashing at her place , while i take some new protein injections my oncologist recommended . i can only get them in san francisco . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s a trade-off . you get cancer , your hair falls out , but you do get to smoke dope .
you ' re not dying .
seen anybody ridin ' hard for <person> .
<person> on the road since sundown -- ain ' t seen a livin ' soul -- be he man or beast .
. `` everything that ' s going to happen to her '' . what was going to happen to her ? you hurt her . ? did y ' hit her , son . ?
hit her ? no . i . i called her . i called her a whore . i .
turns out it ' s against the law to throw bio hazards in the dumpster . who knew ? <continued_utterance> how perfect was he with the one arm ?
hmm ?
who ? i ' d have to have somebody i can trust . when were you born -- i mean , what sign of the zodiac ?
i don ' t know .
must be another <person> then . been flying so many scientists out here -- can ' t keep everyone straight .
who ' s everyone ?
he ' s not any kind of program , <person> . he ' s a <person> .
a <person> ?
means we never shared a bath .
no !
no .
<person> ! ! my man !
perhaps it ' s time you considered a new profession . what i mean is , you don ' t seem to be a very good thief . maybe you should try something else .
what the hell you know about it , <person> ? what are you in for ?
hey , <person> . <person> espresso , please .
rough night , huh ? for here ?
you didn ' t ?
no , dude . fuck him . fuck him in the ear .
you ' re the inventor of this thing .
i prefer the term project designer . and sorry for all the secrecy . <person> will be thrilled you re- established contact .
give me a little credit .
no . you drew what you saw , but the person you ' re seeing now is someone else . i ' m not <person> . i ' m not really on this train .
he ' s waiting .
he ' s waiting ? what ' s he waiting for ? more bodies ? we got lots more buildings in midtown , maybe he ' s waiting to see how many they can blow up .
<person> and . discipline .
oh , my god . but there ' s nothing to be afraid of here . i can ' t hurt you . i wouldn ' t .
you manifested that , <person> .
did i ? or was that you ? when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened , didn ' t you ? terrified . like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor . you did that , <person> .
<person> .
that ' s a real fault , i .
you know , the whole world thinks you killed <person> ? it ' s terrible .
i know . <person> , i can ' t talk now . later . later ?
<person> up !
he ' s probably lying though .
the screech-owl song can be seen as a progression of musical notes . did the notes go up , down or remain at the same pitch ?
i don ' t know . just tell me --
you got a great ass ! i love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor .
<person> , i start looking for our house . you love me ?
not really .

<person> that ! the last part ' s the best . you dry-dive six stories and blammo ! <person> right into the big black .
here ' s the question . it ' s been on my mind more and more . do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating me ?
what ? why would . why would anyone do something to someone they love for the purpose of messing them up ?
. i asked myself , why would the sphere be using a code ? if you ' re trying to communicate , why use a code ?

<person> i e-mail it to you when i figure it out ? this is perfect . i have given the `<person> ' t we be friends ' speech for <number> years . i think i invented the ' <person> ' t we be friends ' speech . but you know what , now i get why they never went for it . you dames got one thing right . sometimes sex does change everything . call me crazy , but i just don ' t see us out on the town , being pals , having dinner , ' cause i ' d bet you anything , at some point , one of us will have very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread . you get what i ' m saying ?
you don ' t want to be friends .
the dmz ?
south bronx . the worst . i tried to ditch him , but he was already in the cab , so i had to take him . that ' s the law . otherwise i would have picked you up .

<person> , i think i should get a job .
<person> . i need to talk to you about those photographs . it ' s very important .
i ' m sure it is . but it ' ll have to wait until tomorrow .
you jerk ! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think ' ll come out of this . you know what ' s gon na come out of this . the end of religion , the end of civilization , the end of the earth . we could become slaves , we could become a colony of these things . <person> ' t you see that ? are you too stupid to see that ?
are you ladies through ? . <continued_utterance> good . it looks like we might be the welcoming committee , so i think we should try and figure out what we ' re gon na do if we have to come face to face with this creature .
truth , <person> . <person> at it ! the new truth ! the new way !
<person> ' t listen to him professor <person> .
will we see you later ?

i . don ' t think so .
i woke to the sound of <person> ' s breathing . it was laboured . i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen . i grabbed her , rushed to the kitchen , and splashed water on her face .
give ' em a little time .
into the backstretch it ' s war <person> still by a length , <person> closing on the inside , is second by two , <person> is third by one and a half , followed by <person> , <person> , <person> ' end and <person> .

that ' s the chance we have to take .
no , we don ' t .
yeah , but you know what ? that whole part about lighting farts is bullshit . you can ' t do that .
mph rmpmh rm .
. maybe we can pretend we ' re going to see each other tomorrow ? <continued_utterance> just for pretend .
<person> , cole , i ' m going to go now . i ' ll see you tomorrow .
forgive me for saying so , <person> , but your methods are too . shall we say . soft ? as head of the pta , i am exercising my right under article <number> of the pta code .
<person> <number> ! you don ' t mean- ? !
actually , <person> , <person> is the most commonly used name on earth .
have you ever actually met a guy named <person> ?
what do you mean ' outgrown it ' ?
i ' m not sure .
what ' s tira misu ?
you ' ll find out .
he won ' t break off now . if he followed me this far he ' ll be back .
he ' s intelligent , but not experienced . his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking .
for a reason that neither of us understand , you are forced to stay near me . that ' s all i know right now .
i have these strange thoughts , i don ' t know where they come from . i can ' t explain it .
i ' m so tired , <person> . i ' m tired in my body . i ' m tired in my mind . i ' m tired in my heart . i need a little help here . i don ' t know if you noticed -- but our little family isn ' t doing so good . <continued_utterance> i ' m praying for us , but i must not be praying right . it looks like we ' re just going to have to answer each other ' s prayers . if we can ' t talk to each other -- we ' re not going to make it . now baby , tell me . i won ' t be mad , honey . did you take the bumble bee pendant ?
no .
or doesn ' t this all begin to suggest to you a kind of . negotiation ? there ' s something <person> can give me , and i want to trade for it . i even wrote to him , offering my help . but he hates me , so he won ' t deal directly . <continued_utterance> punishment , you see . for <person> . just like that gospel program . when you leave , they ' ll turn the volume way up . <person> does enjoy his petty torments .
who killed <person> , <person> . ? you know , don ' t you ?
<person> is on the motorway with a flat tyre . but i couldn ' t hear traffic . just rooks .
she snaps out of it . but she knows .
i don ' t think i could really describe it .
why not ?
how could she not be real ? i can smell her , taste her . she does exactly what she did . it ' s not possible .
you know , i ' ve decided : i ' m just gon na believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing , it ' ll make life so much easier ; the little wife agreeing with her big , strong husband . you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day . he just stares at her -- he really likes this . it ' s familiar , this type of teasing , and it reminds him of when things were good .
ar wa , <person> , we ' ll have <person> in here next , peeing their pants about human rights . get him down , tidy him up , for <person> ' s sake .
maybe he did know the answers .
you ' re planning to speak ?
not if you don ' t want me to .
that girl who died on the way up . his girl ?
yeah .
some more wine ?
i ' m afraid this meat is overdone .
we have a problem .
i know , but for <person> ' s sake i ' ve decided to ignore your attitude .
what ' s that ?
it ' s a shotgun sol .
<person> ' t call me <person> .
what ' s that ?
yes , my lord . we ' ll find them .
<person> ' t fail me again , admiral .

i beg your pardon ! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i ' m a heavy . here ' s your shoe , there ' s your coat , that ' s the door ! contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her arms . the positive force of his manner gives the girl pause . there is a silence . <person> searches for words to explain the offense to her sensibilities .
<person> . i . i don ' t do this sort of thing .
i always knew you would .
and i ' m a lawyer . i mean i ' m a waiter , studying to be a lawyer . and you became a doctor . just like you said you would .

probably . <person> , if i get zeroed .
the road is empty

<person> , well , maybe you should check your messages first .
i ' ll listen now . after your father ' s murder , you were orphaned . you were ten years old . you went to live with cousins , on a sheep and horse ranch in montana . and - ?
and - one morning i just - ran away .
wow . do you make sushi ?
we took a class a while back -- and when he walks in the door at seven- thirty , i am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table - -- covered with homemade sushi .
how you feelin ' ?
after that singin ' ? -- thirsty .
before , of course .
i want to do everything . i got a theory you ' re supposed to do everything before you die . have you ever driven a car , blindfolded , at a hundred and fifty miles an hour ?
what little boy ?
the one from the diner , in denton .

this is what i ' m saying . he must have had party contacts .
there are good party members who help , and there are dirty non-party members who inform on you . of course , they gave him privileges . <continued_utterance> and suddenly , <person> , suddenly you notice that they like you . they honour you , suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world , for example .
how are things standin ' now between you an ' the law ?
all right , i reckon -- i guess this bill of sale -- -- kinda winded him .
it ' s pustules . it ' s called sycosis . <person> differently than psychosis , but it sounds the same .
i don ' t know what that means .
one of the dead romulans had a tricorder . we analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium .
<person> ?
i ' m a lawyer .
you can ' t come here .
you know her ?
sure i know <person> .
a quart of matzoh ball soup for <person> . i know it ' s not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol .
but high sodium .
i want to go with you .
be patient , luke . <person> and watch over the droids .
no . i didn ' t know that .
we learn something new about ourselves every day . now . maybe i didn ' t make myself clear . it is very important that you tell me exactly what <person> knows .
but .
we didn ' t know if any bleed- throughs could occur . the implications would be staggering . that ' s why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events .
you can ' t see here . she ' s making a statement .
where is she ?
i have to .
where ? and don ' t tell me <person> .
i ' m not sure .
oh . right . <continued_utterance> <person> , mr . <person> .

i got a job , but i don ' t know if i ' m going to stay .
i have to tell you . it ' s strange .
how do you mean , strange ?
that ' s true of lots of things .
<person> instance ?
<person> bought the farm . she was my good friend , and friens are the best luck anyone gets . but in war , we must go on without our friends . we take with us their memory , and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death . let me tell you what it is : <person> bough the farm so we can keep on fighting . <continued_utterance> officer on deck !
please continue , sergeant .
not even of dying ?
no .
that her ? <continued_utterance> so she ' s pretty cool , huh ?
actually , no , she ' s a complete psycho . that ' s why she ' s up at pescedero . she tries to blow up a computer factory , but she got shot and arrested .
<person> your own .

i couldn ' t pay someone enough to try to kill me . <person> comes over to take their orders . <continued_utterance> i ' ll have my usual please , <person> .
<person> burger , side of ' cues . you haven ' t introduced me to your fan .

you wan na come in ?
i think they help .
i have consciousness , but i am not mortal . <person> ' t you see why i ' m going crazy ?
<person> ?
it ' s obvious this fellow <person> is impressed with you . he hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up . he ' s young , not terribly bright . not surprising he didn ' t know what a state he ' d put you in .
there ' s so much .
tell me . just start at the beginning .
what do you have ? a pluto call back ?
sure . <person> me when i ' m down .
what about ?
have you seen this ? in otis <person> ' s column . `` the dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad who heads a highbrow jazz quintet is giving an inelegant odor to that elegant <person> where he works . that ' s no way for a card-holding party member to act . <person> won ' t like , you naughty boy ! ''
everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime , it ' s what we are . but now the risks are outa line . the streets are a war zone . and sex can kill you . so you slip on the trodes , you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks .
<person> , this shit ' s illegal .
`` ay pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . ``
`` oh then , dear saint , let lips do what hands to : they pray : grant thou , lest faith turn to despair . ``

'' but that ' s the thing about them - they ' re like pictures . they never blink . they just . stare , and always at me . that ' s my destiny , do you see ? i didn ' t help them when they needed me and this is my penance . <person> . i accept it . but i ' m opting out now , ya get it ? i can ' t stand this anymore ! i wan na close my eyes for once and see something other than torture . it ' s not a bad start , mack . we ' ve made the world a little safer now . <person> , <person> , <person> , now <person> . we ' ve made justice . but i get some too . you have to end all this for me . that ' s why you ' re here . it ' s your destiny .

that ' s not true , is it ?
solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms .
<person> fifty kilometers .
<person> ' t get hysterical , norman .
i ' m telling you , <person> ' s lost it . he ' s saying there ' s a deathwish out for each of us .
we are .
it ' s just the two of us now , <person> , as it should be . your ship and mine . you and me .

well , if i had to guess . i ' d say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who ' s going to be a daddy of his own . <person> , do you know what i see here ?
spit from your dad ?
<person> .
we could have a problem here , couldn ' t we ? i mean , we just lost three men .
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation .
aw , you ' re in love with me . you just dont know it yet . <continued_utterance> <person> , i want to talk to mr . <person> .
where are you going ?
i ' m leaving .
that ' s right , that ' s right . they know who i am . you . they ' ve `` cleared '' me .
they didn ' t clear you for this .

hey <person> ! <person> rico !
carmen . ?
you . <person> to you - you sound like a businessman , a responsible leader . who ' d have thought that , huh ?
you know , seeing you sure brings back a few things .
<person> watching the news . are you watching the news ?
how are you getting to the airport ? you need money for the bus ? <continued_utterance> there ' s a u . s . <person> car outside , norman .
i told you i haven ' t put on that much weight . <continued_utterance> how long since you ' ve been back ?
four years .
i don ' t know .
he knows about my work on the planetary conjunction , doesn ' t he ?
i appreciate your concern , <person> , but i ' ve been itching to try out the argo .
<person> --
i know what i want . my goal is to speak to my wife . the way she and i used to speak . like there was no one in the world but us .
how are you going to do that ?
he ' s got a lot on his mind besides <person> . his wife , bella , is real sick . comatose . i ' m tellin ' you about it now , ' cause he may never . <continued_utterance> you ' re goin ' in the field , so you got ta have full kit . take this - it ' s my own . <continued_utterance> wear it , don ' t ever leave it in your purse . <person> fire it whenever you get the chance . and do your exercises .

<person> , don ' t mess with me right now .
well . my aunt can ' t bring <person> to the daycare , she ' s got her shop now . but i worked it out with my boss . so i ' ll be bringin ' her come next week . <continued_utterance> no reaction . <continued_utterance> if that ' s all right .
<person> to have her . i ' m sorry , mr . <person> , about the other time . women can be moody , you know . and temperamental .
give me the short version .
six shots at less than ten feet . <person> was a large caliber -- <person> is looking at the body .
how long has <person> been driving that bus , mr . <person> ? how many times has she steered clear of danger ? what went wrong that morning ? <continued_utterance> <person> calculated ahead of time what it would cost to sacrifice safety . it ' s the darkest , most cynical thing to imagine , but it ' s <continued_utterance> absolutely true . and now , it ' s up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt , or add an extra yard of guard rail . it ' s the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society . by what i do .
so you ' re just the thing we need .
<person>entors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like .
<person> ' t get me wrong . obi-wan is a great mentor . as wise as <person>aster yoda and as powerful as <person>aster windu . i am truly thankful to be his apprentice . only . although i ' m a padawan learner , in some ways . a lot of ways . i ' m ahead of him . i ' m ready for the trials . i know i am ! he knows it too . he believes i ' m too unpredictable . other <person> my age have gone through the trials and made it . i know i started my training late . but he won ' t let me move on .
i ' m afraid something bad will happen . it ' s a miracle that i ' m even pregnant .
but if the doctor said --

in profile , with <person> in b . g . his eyes are closed .
well , i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him . he says he belongs to someone called obi-wan <person> . <continued_utterance> i thought he might have meant old <person> . do you know what he ' s talking about ? well , i wonder if he ' s related to <person> .
that old man ' s just a crazy old wizard . tomorrow i want you to take that <person> <number> unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed . that ' ll be the end of it . it belongs to us now .

maybe if you ' d try thinking once in a while , you ' d get somewhere .
<person> , i hope i don ' t have to remind you --
i appreciate your concern , <person> , but i ' ve been itching to try out the argo .
<person> , girls don ' t go for me the way they go for you .
<person> went for you , right .
but . she was a showgirl . she didn ' t have an old convent .
she told us about one . the little sisters of the moonlight . in <person> .
did you intend to kill him ?
was it a sudden quarrel ? had there been any trouble between you before ?
what ' s that ?
i ' m thinking it ' s time to settle down . one woman . one house . you know . it ' s time .
but what . before that turns rotten . what if they surround the space with barbed wire , <person> ?
<person> ' t talk about things you know nothing about . he was in a dictatorship !
you earned it .

i can ' t imagine it ' s that difficult . . no rudder on the board .
now this is a place of many wonders . see those guys in line over there ? <continued_utterance> we call them `` <person> '' . they all have season passes , and do little more than ride the wave all day long . some of them get pretty good . <continued_utterance> that ' s where they hang out when they ' re not riding the wave . <person> ' t get too close to them .

<person> ' t open that now . it ' s warm .
you can ' t just make a person up .

<person> , i didn ' t really want it anyway . i just wanted to order it .
can i get you something else ? i mean , you shouldn ' t leave without getting something for free .
i got so many sunglasses . i couldn ' t live without my shades , man . i must have twelve pair of shades .
where ?
because i realized what i was feeling for you , have always felt for you , was something i didn ' t understand , like a language i didn ' t speak . it scared me so i did what i do . i snuck away . turns out the heart attack was easy to get over . you were somethin ' else . and when i went to see all those women , i found out i was never really present for any of them . and something inside me at some point , had just . shut off . that ' s when i think my heart gave out and you saved me . i finally get what it ' s all about . i ' m <number> years old and i am in love for the first time in my life . and that ' s what i came here to say .
<person> , this is the best birthday ever .
you said a mouthful there , sister .

<person> and misleading . why do you think he takes their skins , <person> ? thrill me with your wisdom .
she met some friend of <person> ' s who works for a record company . he thinks she ' s got a great voice .

yes , some of it is speakable .
i am , commander riker . . may i touch your hair ?
praetor , we ' ve come to romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance . if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation , i suggest you do so now . <person> continues to stare at <person> . it is strangely seductive . <person> disquieting in its intensity . <person> handles it with grace , her level gaze never leaving his .
i don ' t trust <person> .
well , i don ' t trust him , either . but he is my friend . besides , we ' ll soon be gone .
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior . sometimes violent behavior . theo <person> had two of his fingers bit off by his cow .

cause she doesn ' t look at me like everybody and i don ' t want her to .
oh , kiddo , you don ' t even know .
i have a wife .
it ' s from hunger .
nothing for <person> ?
i want to sit beside you tomorrow .
<person> .
spock !
the ship -- out of danger ?
<person> carefully , <person> . maybe not in your own name , but as privy councillor or vice-president .
i don ' t have to think carefully . this is utterly ridiculous .
it is not . get out .
i ' m sorry , and i ' m sorry you lost your friend , and i don ' t think red is the right color .
i couldn ' t . do you know how hard it ' s been not to call you ? i pick up the phone every night . whenever that commercial comes on .
. the micheline commercial .
yes . and they , too , will become its martyrs .
let her go and you ' ll live .
yes . i just . i didn ' t know what to say ?
do you want to come with me ? -- i ' m going to the flea market .
i ' m not sure . i was confused . <person> . i think mostly i wanted to scare them .
you had a gun with you ?
no .
and who was driving the .
snow . <person> ' t you hear me radio ? i ' m <person> .
yes . we heard .
do you think there ' s somebody out there you could love as much as your wife ? maybe even more ?
it ' s hard to imagine .
<person> ' t worry . you ' re doing fine .
could you look any more like a cop ?
rac . r-a-c . <person> , automate , computerize . that , my boy , is the future . one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling . her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin . <person> hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike . the little girl jumps with joy .
what ever happened to just bowling ?
i don ' t remember .
it don ' t matter . i ' m gon na get you outta here .
no . i didn ' t . someone else did , and i wound up here . bad luck , i guess .
bad luck ? <person> .
you ' re playing a piano , <person> ?
that wasn ' t me .
i feel perfectly awful , running after you like this , but --
you got trouble , eh ?
i don ' t know .
what month ?
what are you doing ?
are you my friend ?
you don ' t have to come with me .
<person> , cool , i ' ll probably just grab my stuff from yours then . <continued_utterance> as if i ' m not gon na come with you nutter .
<person> , are you all right ?
no , sir . i am finding it difficult to concentrate . i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of . remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory .
i ' m no cop .
well , if you are , it ' s entrapment already .
i know , but he ' s got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off . he needs me for just one more season . i can ' t leave him now .
i feel for you , <person> , you ' re going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important . what good is all your uncle ' s work if it ' s taken over by the empire ? . you know they ' re starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems . it won ' t be long before your uncle is merely a tenant , slaving for the greater glory of the empire .
<person> ! let ' s not be rash !
come with me . <continued_utterance> i mean , the kids could stay with <continued_utterance> <person> and <person> . or <person> , or .
i couldn ' t agree with you more .
i think about a lot of things .
he ' s going to use people .
what a courageous stand !
what is it ?
power surge . the transmission beam ' s too strong !
i didn ' t mean you . but just ordinary people . a guy i know - dough-boy - met his wife that way . they got to talking . she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop , taking her home with the flag up .
that ' s very romantic . some of your fares must be interesting . see any stars , politicians , deliver any babies yet ?
okay , what is this ? if you want to dump <person> on me , no sale . you ' re stuck with him .
i know your secret .
hey , look who ' s answering the door .
and look who ' s at the door .
not exactly . but the detective
we have no record of it . some other precinct must have made the arrest . it sounds like your special friend was wanted for something else .
i know .
i ' d miss my life .
<person> ?
look at it , baby . <person> , baby !
it will be okay .
no , i was thinking about you .
i think the evidence . is on your side . <continued_utterance> the eyes study him . dissect him , even . <continued_utterance> i ' m headed north , nephew , to where our family comes from , in newfoundland . thought i ' d never go back . but the older y ' get . <continued_utterance> there ' s a pull . becomes an ache . as if where your people started held a purpose for you . like you ' re a piece in a puzzle . <continued_utterance> . lookin ' for where y ' fit . <continued_utterance> you , too .
in what sense do you m .
yes . a little of . high school . but i sign when i have sixteen years .
you signed at sixteen ? wow . so you didn ' t finish school ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> . <person> shakes his head , no . after a beat .

i will offer that report . well , then , now that your memory seems to be clearing , can you tell us what else you observed at that time ?
before the actual accident ?
oh , no . uh uh .
why not ?
you know i ' d feel a lot better if you hadn ' t taken most of my money in that poker game last friday night .
<person> ? not an island game . i no good .
staring . consequently , when he approached me on his way out i wasn ' t surprised , but i didn ' t let on .
he was writing a special sunday piece on . ?
<person> likes that angle about the teacher .
what teacher ?
oh . hey .
how ' s your team doing ?
you ' re not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer .
she ' s not a suspect , sir , she ' s a witness . could i ask you to step outside , please .
why did she do it ?
you . she said i didn ' t love her .
and where did you sit that morning ?
my usual place . on the right side .
i don ' t believe it . <person> horses wouldn ' t drag <person> to -
he was there with someone . so i suppose she must have dragged him - that ' s not fair . i ' m going back to mongi . i think <person> ' s coming home . i ' m going to go home .
yeah .
that one ' s spare .
hi .
we ' re going to the student reunion meeting . you coming ?
yeah ! like me ! i don ' t choke on my own gall - i fight back ! let them choke , not me !
i ' m not a man , sidney , i ' m -
hi . this is <person> . leave a message .
hi , <person> . <person> . i don ' t think this is working out . i think you ' re great , but maybe we should just take some time off from each other . it ' s not you , really .
yeah and totally changing their tastes . like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like . ever . and i ' m talking really liking it . it ' s . unnerving .
i think you can expect just about anything right now . people have done some wild things after having a heart attack . selling businesses , getting divorced , moving . some people say it saved their lives .
it wouldn ' t bother you if <person> was in danger , would it ?
nope , i couldn ' t care less .
i have . many times . i didn ' t sleep . i counted .
so what ' s the damage . total ?
i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows .
you ' d probably have to go somewhere to really look into it .
and i get to see the transcripts .
<person> enough .
my gosh , <person> .
<person> , it was awful .
i don ' t know . it ' s all i ever wanted to do .
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks didn ' t really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats , i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i ' m not insulting you .
i walk this way to school with <person> .
he your best buddy ?
what are you talking about ?
i just saw it in the mirror , it doesn ' t look like my ass anymore .
but .
<person> , this is body armor . out tac guys wear it . it ' ll stop a <number> gauge round . this other individual must ' ve had one under his coat .
i know that one was me .
<person> not to keep score . <continued_utterance> soft lips .
you want to hear the rest of this ?
<person> ' s well -- come this far . <continued_utterance> well -- what do you make of it ?

<person> . that ' s his name ? <person> ? is he french ?
no , it ' s empty .
there ' s someone else here .
thinking what you were doing and saying , just being consumed by thinking of you . i loved it so much , that feeling .
i did too . <continued_utterance> i used to watch you undress . <continued_utterance> i never tired of watching you undress . every time , it was exciting . right until . to the end .
looks like we ' re going to get that land we ' ve been wanting along the river bottom . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t tell you -- but i bought the mortgage on the hardman ranch , and it ' s due today -- on my way over there now .
did you send that <person> to table- top ?
<person> went there with two boys . they were the ones who found her . so they ' re not suspects . but you probably will be .
<person> lady , we can ' t overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps . but i forbid you to drag it into the living room !
rache says i have to eat big spaghetti . <continued_utterance> and many meatballs .
you ' ll be up to your armpits in meatballs , i ' m flying them in from sweden .
how serious is the damage ?
i ' m having trouble scanning underground . there ' s a lot of radiation leaking from something .
hot damn ! that ' s what ' s up ! <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .

so i ' ve wandered into a real woman trap here , haven ' t i ?
except you ' re the first woman i ' ve ever been able to get up here . and i ' ve blown all my props already . so how about some brandy ?
long ago .
not so long .
vince knows you ' re here .
how ?
as ship ' s counselor , it ' s your duty to know not only when you ' re needed . but also when you ' re not .
you can ' t fool an empath , captain . i know exactly when i ' m needed .

exactly anything . whatever you want . whoever you want to be . <person> , get us another round , would you . <person>zio gets the hint and heads for the bar . <continued_utterance> you want to go skiing without leaving your den , you can . but i ' m assuming a guy like you , you wan na go skiing you fly to aspen . that ' s not what you ' re interested in here . it ' s about the stuff you can ' t have . right ? the forbidden fruit . <continued_utterance> like running into a liquor store with a . <number> magnum in your hand , feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins . or . . see that guy , with the drop-dead philipino girl friend ? <person> ' t you like to be that guy for twenty minutes ? the right twenty minutes . i can make it happen . and you won ' t even tarnish your wedding ring .
<person> , <person> , i need that bag .

they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it ' s not even worthy of a response . i guess i ' ll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .
but you don ' t know yet , so your negativity ' s a bit premature , wouldn ' t you say ? <continued_utterance> or fuck those new york publishers . publish it yourself . i ' ll chip in . just get it out there , get it reviewed , get it in libraries . let the public decide . giving <person> a look that says <person> has no idea what he ' s <continued_utterance> <person> ' t come over the top . <person> still .

let ' s just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant , and now they ' re both somewhere in mexico . <person> got a job here , some of her family ' s here , so they said `` <person> is the place you outta be '' .

b . b . who ?
forget it . the real money ball is the boy .
<person> , the boy . we ' re on the verge of a farce , a real farce . as i see it , if <person> had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat . but since primarily he ' s wedded to his work , he ' s not going to be able to take it .
what ' s he in for anyway ?
murder .

what . are you ?
<person> , my boy , there are times when you disappoint me . why haven ' t you paid me ? and why did you have to fry poor greedo like that . after all we ' ve been through together .

my wife used to say i ' m a hard man to know . like a closed book . complained about it all the time . she was beautiful . i loved her . but i guess i couldn ' t show it enough . i killed her , <person> . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t pull the trigger . but i drove her away . that ' s why she died . because of me , the way i am .

i needed you immediately to help oversee the re-fit . . your service record on the talos is exemplary , but there are a few things i would like to discuss with you regarding my requirements for a first officer . shall we say dinner in my quarters at <number> hours ?
there ' s the silver lining . a honeymoon to a romantic mexican resort that ' s pre-paid on my credit card because i wanted to surprise the man who jilted me .

<person> , you got my attention , but this is cutting off the circulation to my head , here . <person> ' you mind ? <continued_utterance> i thought we were friends .

you mean you don ' t want to go to a movie ? there ' s plenty of movies around here .
no , i don ' t feel so good . we ' re just two very different kinds of people , that ' s all .
interesting .
nothing comes .
<person> on .
<person> , norman . four minutes .
watch your step . <continued_utterance> <person> , me please . <person> me . <continued_utterance> watch your step . this way . this way . quickly
this way . nothing to see . <person> on .
oh , so you ' re that dr . <person> .
you ' ve heard of me ?
no , you ' re absolutely .
and you go start with that stuff in this town .
<person> <person> .
<person> .
never saw the point of ' em .
me , too . you have a paperclip ?
you liked it , she said . <continued_utterance> she watched out for you .
<person> ' s not coming back .
oh . one night won ' t kill you . and tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life . <continued_utterance> is everything okay ?
i ' m just tired -- i guess .
what report ?
you mean they haven ' t told you yet ?
forty messages start to look needy .
<person> , you ' re enjoying this .
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe .
that ' s not sayin ' much .
we ' re pretty wiped . probably go back to the hotel and crash .
<person> , i know what you mean . it ' s a long drive up here . where ' re you staying ?
back away then .
wait a minute --
on the `` k . c . `` ? but -- but why should he want you ?
why not ? good foremen don ' t grow on bushes .
i don ' t .
you said `` did . `` is he dead ?
i don ' t know what got into me .
there are pictures . <continued_utterance> dr . <person> , one of the authors of the book --
that is correct .
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor . how did that happen to a non-party member ?
no , no cops !
you wanted by the law or somethin ' ?
can you get my balloon ?
<person> ' t you afraid to be out in the open like this ?
okay , <person> , looks like we ' re going to have to let you go .
take it easy kids , i just sat up too fast . <person> , tell them . am i in good shape ? how were my tests this morning ?
that ' s for sure .
what happened ?
now imagine a killer with no patterns , no tell-tale fetishes , no rituals , no hidden desire to be caught . a perfect vessel of evil , killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake . he ' d be immune to capture , wouldn ' t he ? your task forces , your forensics teams - they ' d be helpless .
is that something you believe in , <person> ? evil ?
from what ?
from what ?
i mean open him up .
that ' s a bit strong isn ' t it ?
we have people .
<person> ' em . then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago . you have his initials ; mrc , inside the wetsuit . the long hair is distinctive , someone may recognize him . it ' s a semi-long shot .
<person> . <continued_utterance> you got my whip ? <continued_utterance> lose yourselves .
what ' s on your mind , <person> ?
how long have you been into wine ?
i started to get serious about seven years ago .
it ' s too risky . and your senses aren ' t that attuned , young apprentice .
and yours are ?
i don ' t know , i can imagine quite a bit !
you ' ll get it !
my cpu is a neural-net processor . a learning computer . but skynet presets the switch to `` read-only '' when we are sent out alone .
<person> ' t want you thinking too much , huh ?
neither are they . you have to be human first . they don ' t qualify . bull queers take by force , that ' s all they want or understand . i ' d grow eyes in the back of my head if i were you .
thanks for the advice .
you ' re gon na have to cover me on this one , ' <person> . i can ' t stay for the cop show .
you can ' t do that , travis . you ' re my witness .
i have to go away , <person> .
<person> ' t do it . please . don ' t go -- tears are streaming down his face . tight closeup terminator , turning toward <person> .
it ' s a general retreat ! the boats are coming down .
we ' ve just landed here on what cap troopers are calling the `` big k '' with the <number> th <person> . it ' s an ugly planet , a bug planet , a planet hostile to life as we kow igkkkkk !
theo , i want you to get out of this town .
i ' m getting to like it here .
i ' m sorry <person> - ?
jedi <person> sifo-dyas . he ' s still a leading member of the jedi council , is he not ?
no , sir . they are not aboard .
how long until the shock wave hits the observatory ?
an anti-matter discharge directly ahead . it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away .
a photon torpedo ?
no . but you will . it ' s very important that you live .
i can ' t believe this is happen- ing . how could than man get up after you .
yes he ' s got it . he might call , he might not , but if he does be ready .
i ' l l see what i can do .
they open a window .
it ' s ten flights up .
not yet . i suppose i should .
<person> ? i guess we ' re gettin ' to be friends , ain ' t we ?
so is it kind of about death and mortality , or . ?
mrnmm , yeah . but not really . it shifts around a lot . <person> you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father . and some other stuff happens , some parallel narrative , and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a robbe-grillet mystery -- you know , with no real resolution .
dead people ?
ghosts .
how much sleep do you need ?
how much sleep ?
no , i absolutely understand . of course .
otherwise you ' d be fighting me off .
i don ' t think you do love me .
what ?
but , but but but .
no , no , i see .
. he was going to come to me that night . after .
. after his shift .
the driver will .
but i speak english .
we don ' t have a tractor beam .
you left spacedock without a tractor beam ?
my god .
but the point is <person> - well we know this - <person> loves <person> and he misses her and apparently he ' s come to his senses .
just press the button all the way down when you ' re ready , okay ?
where ' s she go ?
in one goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ?
i checked the place out . there weren ' t no dicks in there .
what ? ! ?
<person> down , baby . you got ta double down on an eleven .
no matter . i probably wouldn ' t have made it in new york , anyway .
you ' re very talented , <person> .
theo , <person> is dead .
i didn ' t come this far to bury a guy that ' s not my dad . he owes me .
and that ' s enough t . ?
death storm . <person> wave cracks her steel hull amidships , one inch crack from starboard to port . men go in the water . <person> lost . after a week . <continued_utterance> they come to <person> , call off the search . he stands like a stone . then turns , sharp , the way he does . says only , ' he ' s alive . and i know where . '
so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck . <continued_utterance> you taught my child that i am some limp dick <continued_utterance> you think <continued_utterance> well , maybe real growth .
oh please .
i don ' t understand .
<person> minutes . that ' s all i could give you . no mission to fulfill . just . the two of you .
she ' s been implicated in a crime . i need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect .
and if she ' s not innocent . if she ' s , you know , `` quirky ? ''
and what have i done to her , besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ? sidney , you were right -- the boy ' s a dilly .
why ? because i don ' t like the way you toy with human lives ? - your contempt and malice ? because i won ' t be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it ' s crippled <person> . ? you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory . but to me , and thousands of others like me , you and your slimy scandal , your phony patriotics - to me , mr . <person> , you are a national disgrace !
a funeral .
that girl who died on the way up . his girl ?
you don ' t have to slow down your career to help raise them .
<person> , will you just for once not make the reason you won ' t marry me your fucking career !
come on , <person> .
come on where ? back to a one-room apartment that i can ' t pay for ? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not ?
no . <person> ' t tell me that .
i ' m sorry .
your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sandpeople with one blaster .
i know , but he ' s got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off . he needs me for just one more season . i can ' t leave him now .
go for it , man .
i ' m going in . will you be my wing-man ?
<person> ? <person> ? i like the sound of that .
stop that .
then what do i say ?
i can ' t say what then you say .
. but you saw what was underneath , of course .
no . tell me about it .
and you go start with that stuff in this town .
everybody needs a hobby . <person> , look page .
contacts : where are you <person> ?
look , there ' s that bloke my mum works for ; <person> .
actually , we haven ' t . your operational awareness has become too great . if you found out the truth about yourself once , you might do so again . as for <person> , i ' m sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours . <continued_utterance> do you have the courage to serve your country one final time ?
i ' m going to find you , rutledge .
i ' m your blood .
you wish !
the play . all written out for you . i had the clerk at bridewell do it , he has a good fist for lettering . <continued_utterance> there ' s a new scene he turns the pages and shows her .
will you read it for me ?
who are you , please ? i thought the police were through in here .
i ' m clarice starling , senator . fbi .
i used to live with someone named <person> . died of cancer , after nine years together . <person> soul on this earth . <continued_utterance> went from the funeral , and bought that dog . named her <person> . just so i could say the name a hunnerd times a day . women are foolish , huh ?
i never thought so .
i put a lotta trust in you , chickie .
i know you do , sidney .
are they crows or jackdaws ? it ' s so nice to get these little details right .
they ' re rooks .
yes , you have . where i get hazy , though , is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed , riddled with . <number> caliber bullets . does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence , mr . <person> , or is it just me ?
yes . it does .
<person> away before i give you what you gave <person> .
you ' re not yourself , <person> . you ' re tired . when you think things over , you ' ll see i ' m right . <person> -- <person> opens his door , turns on bruno .
<person> ' t do it !
you ' ll lose the signal !
there ' s nothing , <person> . not even if you were a relative .
<person> , mr . <person> , could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself , as a personal loan ?
it ' s over . <person> me take you out tonight . <person> ' s have some fun . i owe you that .
what ' s fun for you ? you want to go to the shooting range or the morgue ? <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry .
that ' d be dire .
if we find her we ' ll get in the papers .
you ' d be fun to go to paris with .
it ' s a great city to stay up all night in . when ' s your birthday ?
gibarian . he was here .
you said he was dead .
we have a library ?
a bad one . it was the only book in there . <person> , come here , look at this .
and cigarettes . i smoke , too .
you are <continued_utterance> and you . love my kids . how fucking touching . <continued_utterance> they came out of my body !
what makes you so sure ?

i know . <person> ' s gon na get the rainman suite . <person> , baby . we ' re going to <person> !
<person> ! you think we ' ll get there by midnight ?
i don ' t know ! someone . <continued_utterance> this is my room . you can sleep here .
where will you sleep ?
that ' s right .
what happened ?
you blew it -- big time . she doesn ' t want you back .
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?
when you get back , i ' ll be gone --
and then i ' ll see you in new york --
<person> ' t say anything .

oh , yeah . i ' m late . <person> .
you look handsome .
okay , we got one-two-three , and on three we both shoot . got it ? page <number> .
got it .
alright , here ' s the deal . you get three tries ; three heats . we judge each run and only your high score counts . if you fall you get no score for the run . your score will be added to the total for your team , and the winner gets the surfer king trophy . any questions ? <continued_utterance> then let ' s begin . grounds is up first . <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>
it looks like we have a tie . this has never happened before , but i seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules . hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do !
<person> , let ' s stop this charade .
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about , <person> .
i ' m really sorry . i swear it won ' t happen again . it ' s just . you weren ' t around and .
<person> , <person> i think we should stop hanging out .
i don ' t want to worry you .
not worry me ? i ' m your partner .
takes the stuff a while to ferment . gim me . <continued_utterance> now open the other one .
i ' m almost afraid to . what did you bring me , contraband <person> --
yes . he does .
<person> said that ? <continued_utterance> you ' ve talked to <person> ?
<person> , better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and . couscous , was it she made him ? boy , kids go wild for that . <continued_utterance> i ' ll drop him at tucker ' s party saturday , if one of you guys can pick him up . i have to go into the city . <continued_utterance> you know what happens to spaghetti when it waits around for you too long ?
no .
i ' ll take that .
<person> this out . <person> this be cash or credit card ?
the empire considers this a matter of internal security . we regret you ' ve become involved .
when this is over , i owe you a drink .
i ' m already pretty wasted . but . uh . here ' s to you .
light-weight ! <continued_utterance> hey . me and you should go upstairs now . i really want to . tell you something .
captain , just tell me what you see . just look and speak .
i see a card .
you got those for me on <person> ' s day . when there were still valentines around here .
you ran out on this relationship .
i said grow up , little drummer boy . <continued_utterance> tamara rang me this morning . said to finish the house . it goes on the market in the spring and that ' s it ; over .
why does the asshole always get the girl ?
there ' s not much time . they think i ' m re-initializing the system . one last look at her . that ' s all i can give you . if that .
they ' ll nail your ass for this .
i think i ' ll read a little .
you went out last night , didn ' t you , <person> ?
-- it was a betrayal .
yes . but it wasn ' t really . it was just .
<person> killed himself at five .
that ' s horrible .
sit . <continued_utterance> he ' s a nice boy . a little nerdy maybe , but nice , wouldn ' t you say ?
oh , i don ' t know . maybe . he ' s very inexperienced .
<person> ! what ' re you doing ?
i ' m getting experience .
you wan na hang with the big boys , you got ta get your hands dirty . you cool ?
yeah , i ' m cool .
i ' m sorry the experiment didn ' t work . i wanted it to with all my heart . i wanted to do that picnic with my daughter . i feel i ' ve disappointed you terribly .
no . no . i am so proud of you .
sure . <person> with lots of music underneath , drowning it out .
<person> ' t you sometimes hate yourself ?
but you said .
that ' s where i ' m going . to see her .
you don ' t know that .
have they ever been busted ?
why do you talk to mom when you ' re by yourself ?
it makes me feel better .
you ' re a tough one , aren ' t you ?
reasonably so . yes .
a few days ago .
does he stay with you here ?
everything is somebody else ' s-
not your children . not your life .
we haven ' t done anything .
<person> .
huh ?
yes .
me ? i could never go to a place like that .
why not ?
i will go . but not you .
you shit ! i ' ll decide if i go or not . not you . i don ' t know what you do on your planet , but i didn ' t think that was very nice walking out on me like you did .
i mean it as a compliment . you ' ve got such great taste , i don ' t know . most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste . used to say , the cream of america : rich and thick .
then i ' ll take it as a compliment .
i ' m not sure that it matters now .
<person> to me . i feel that something terrible ' s going to happen . do i need to get off the train ? am i going to die ?
<person> ' s get an ekg . mr . <person> , i ' m dr . <person> . are you in any pain right now ?
feel some pressure in my chest . it ' s real tight .
self-defense ?
everyone knows what <person> was like . he probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you , like he did at the sun- up that night . <person> ' t that it ?
i ' m picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system .
what sort of signature ?
gospel . a jazz solo on the organ . what next ? <person> goes to <person> ? <person> friday-a- go-go ? what were you thinking ?
i was thinking <person> . get some butts in those seats .
i don ' t know . and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table .
well , if i had to guess . i ' d say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who ' s going to be a daddy of his own . <person> , do you know what i see here ?
what ' s that ?
what ?
yes i did ! after every break-up i secretly thought : nope . they belong together .
you thought that after the second break-up ?
this is so exciting ! let ' s fuck !
this is the millennium , <person> ! this is <person> ! there ' s more to life than sex !
you don ' t think i put something in it , do you ?
you put explosives around the habitat , i can ' t imagine what you ' d put in a drink .
you want toast ?
just for a few days . <continued_utterance> i ' d stay with <person> but he ' s being a fucking asshole .
so do you . it ' s your smell i ' ll miss as much as anything .
<person> ' s get married , okay ? <continued_utterance> i want to marry you . is that okay ? <continued_utterance> when something that means your whole life . is the last time ever . <continued_utterance> god should tell you . or it ' s not fair . <continued_utterance> it felt right to me . it felt like getting married .
why ?
you let me use all the parts of myself that night - ouisa opens the door into the dining room .
since you sent me a key to your house , i decided to use it -- to make a little social call on your father . i thought he ' d be interested to know he his a lunatic son . the faintest flicker of <person> ' s eyes indicates the intensity of his reaction . he stares hard at guy . <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
then a i correct , mr . <person> , in assuming that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement ?
i ' m too tired for this . <person> ' s just go .
<person> , this is what we came for . we met a beautiful baby and she likes you .
<person> up . i ' d better contact metcalf . i should think this calls for more questioning of mr . <person> .
questioning ? nuts ! let ' s take him in .
captain -- i might have a way to find them .
counselor ?
i don ' t see how you can not remember how you got here , <person> . <continued_utterance> you ' re not a deserter , are you . <person> ?
no , sir .
<person> up .
oh darling - is that for me ?
thanks .
<person> . it ' s pretty far , but i think we can make it .
a manifestation . your way of making sense of it . this is crushing . colter fights back terror .
you had no right .
really evil . <person> how many people have you brutally murdered ?
`` brutal '' is such a subjective word . i mean , what ' s brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another .
you gon na open my present ?
cool .
his ekg returned to normal almost immediately which means i don ' t expect any permanent damage . he ' s very lucky .
thank you . . .
you could move in with us in town .
never , thank you .
<person> , i ' m really sorry to put you through this . i just couldn ' t face going to the police by myself when my italian ' s so rotten .
<person> ' t be daft . it ' s fine . i ' m delighted you finally made it to venice . i ' m delighted , contrary to rumour , you ' re still in one piece ?
you want to watch those force fields . <continued_utterance> you ' ll be having plenty of chances to get hurt , don ' t worry about that .
<person> . just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about , okay ?
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks didn ' t really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats , i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i ' m not insulting you .
no , i ' m fascinated .
all flayed . ?
partially , yes . but <person> , that ' s an active case , i ' m not involved . if -
you mean you won ' t tell .
i mean i don ' t know -- why should i lie to you ?
i ' m not going to <person> .
<person> up- yes you are . now listen to tee . we ' ll stop at a cash machine on the way . a long thoughtful pause .
but tell me why i can ' t . <continued_utterance> there ' s something not right here . <continued_utterance> i feel cold , death .
that place . is strong with the dark side of the force . a domain of evil it is . in you must go .
i will . i will . we still have another day .
you promised .
<person> , have i ever done anything really stupid ?
no .
he doesn ' t have one now .
where ' s your mom ?
what ' d you do to me ?
nothing much . just had you stretched out as stiff as a board between those two chairs --
in other news . oh , did you hear about the six-armed <person> that robbed a bank the other day ?
oh man , that ' s so my fantasy - life size bettys tellin ' me what to do . `` get down on the ground , you filthy man . `` yes , <person> . `` bend over ! '' yes , mistress betty .
oh . that ' s alright . then i ' ll come back at a better time . what would be a better time .
later on .
oh , i got over that . it was nothing , really . the papers always blow these things up . a little stiffness . that ' ll go away . i just sleep more , that ' s all .
travis ' taxi pulls up to <number> east <number> th <person> .
no -- i don ' t suppose there ' s any -- rush -- <continued_utterance> if i was like her , i ' d stay in the west .
that means you ' re goin ' back east -- <person> ?
i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you ' re the king .
sure , around here , any fat old bald guy could be king . i ' m nothing . it wouldn ' t do any good for me to talk to the congress . hey , you thirsty ? you like orange whips ?
fuck you , norman ! it ' s right here . <continued_utterance> `` although advised of risks , all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft . <person> , <person> , usn . ``
where did you get this ?
and there ' s no way - no natural way - these could ' ve wound up in the bodies ?
they live in malaysia . in this country , they ' d have to be specially raised , from imported eggs .
what ?
he ' s on a build up to detonation !
and a little bit later , why don ' t you come by for a drink with us ?
i ' ll make sure i get those drinks .
<person> , look !
we must be right over the colony .
oh .
should i keep reading ?
absolutely .
let me do a gravitational scan . <continued_utterance> there are some inconsistencies here . maybe the planet you ' re looking for was destroyed .
oh , my god .
do you feel that ?
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot .
we both missed .
this one ' s for both of us .
<person> and <person> . <person> .
now your signature . not `` dickie '' . your signature .
without the glasses you ' re not even ugly . i don ' t need them because i never read . how do i look .
if i grew up here , i don ' t think i ' d ever leave .
i doubt that .
yes .
that ' s good . judges like adopted indian boys . tell me more about the ottos .
<person> , listen to me ! it ' s her ! <person> is mrs . x ! she killed <person> and the two other men !
<person> , that ' s great -- it just so happens though , that i met . <person> , and much to my delight , not only is she alive , but she ' s female . i thought i told you . <person> looks at <person> , very suspiciously . he looks back at her , and tries to smile , pretending that he is having a pleasant , and completely irrelevant conversation .
we ' re sending a squad up .
uh , uh , negative . we had a reactor leak here now . give us a few minutes to lock it down . <person> leak . very dangerous .
it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger . not their grief .
who did they get for that ?
but you can ' t , <person> . we ' d both be arrested for murder .
we ' d both be arrested for murder ?
if i have an off day , he could win .
that ' s terrible . you ' re the surfer king .
<person> .
<person> . any relation to colonel joachim <person> ?
i suppose it might . do you want to fuck ?
i do . yes . um . do you ?
you see this red toy ? that ' s for the captain , he ' s finicky . and this blue one ? that ' s for <person> .
do you have a name for all of your cats ?
no . what a night , huh ?
yeah , that was some ride home . must have been pretty exciting .
<person> , laugh it up , laugh it up , and when you all wake up dead with your throats cut some night --
i mean , i could see if he just heard the noise and wandered in , but to actually invite him into your home . .
`` an <person> . `` did you ever see it ? cary grant and <person> . before that it was called `` <person> and <person> . ``
women love this movie .
no , i ' m not .
what are your plans in new york ?
i ' ll get him out .
they came into my house . my wife told them who i was -- how many times did i put it on the line , <person> -- ? how many times --
i know .
you were going to figure this out !
could you find out which precinct - the clerk looks through the book .
the name ?
coo-er . in your parents ' bedroom ? still i suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job - strutting about on stage .
he doesn ' t strut ; he ' s a drummer .
an error in the front office .
error in front office .
yes . this drivers license photo was found with her body . we ' re creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site .
you sure she ' s dead ?
that ' s where i ' m going . to see her .
she ' s in trouble ?
help him ? he could ' ve killed me . and you . the guests agree .
you were attracted to him -
so <person> opens up another past for you . a parallel past . it looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world . in essence , by sending you back , an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created . it looks identical to ours , but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality .
what happens to the <person> world after i leave it ?
i ' ve had it . no more wirehead shit in my car . you understand ? you want to poach your lobes , do it somewhere else .
<person> , you got my attention , but this is cutting off the circulation to my head , here . <person> ' you mind ? <continued_utterance> i thought we were friends .
anything ever happen to make you think they weren ' t ?
rock -- i ' m gon na tell you somethin ' i ain ' t never told anybody .
go on in .
<person> , maybe i ' d better take my car --
great , <person> . en .
<person> . it ' s good to see you . reunion night ! how lovely !
you think <person> killed her ?
the killer knew right where she was .
<person> ' t look as if your friend is in , <person> . who is it ?
my brother ' s number , but-
no , no ! i haven ' t heard any of this . i never got those telephone calls . i ' ve never been in this house . get your things together .
all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?
<person> ' t think about it . go on instinct .
ace of spades .
six kids ? what was that like ?
crowded . i had to move to new york just to get some room . and where ' d i wind up ? a one bedroom apartment with three roommates .
this is a convent , not a clinic . we offer moral guidance , not hardware .
have you been out in those streets ? do you know what those kids are up against ? you should help them !
i ' ve got my own ideas .
so , you really think he ' s hot ?
you ' ve got ta stop walking away .
if i stay , i will say awful things to you that i might not even mean . you pick .
cleaner . by the time norton retires , i will have made him a millionaire .
<person> . they ever catch on , he ' s gon na wind up wearing a number himself .
well , come on . it ' s getting late . i only hope we can get back before <person> really blows up .
if you don ' t mind my saying so , sir , i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you ' ve gotten him back to your workshop .
there ! before he can shoot , there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room .
no -- there !
only a couple hundred bucks . i ' ll give you half .
get some food .
i understand .
i ' m going to show you why we insist on such precautions . on the afternoon of july <number> , <number> , he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary . his mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an ekg . when the nurse bent over him , he did this to her . <continued_utterance> the doctors managed to re-set her jaw , more or less , and save one of her eyes . his pulse never got over eighty-five , even when he ate her tongue . i keep him in here .
i ' ve never seen your place . <person> perfect .
i ' m going to cook , <person> . i ' m going to cook beautifully .
have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side ?
<person> in bed with them ? that would too much to wish for .
oh my lord . you were just dancing in there , right ?
yeah , so ?
evening , <person> .
see your license , <person> ?
something ' s up wi .
you think i didn ' t get that ?
not if we let her in .
no .
what ' s wrong ?
they know she ' s here ! they ' re on their way !
i understand why it would seem confusing . <person> human rituals -- like weddings , birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions . these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time .
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander <person> will be leaving to assume command of the titan ?
we could get a place together . we could get a loft .
god , <person> , that sounds nice . i miss my daughter . maybe she could come live with us .
because , because . we don ' t have to build an old mill . they have an old mill . yeah . it ' s on a stream -- that ' s where you put a mill .
. they run on water .
nothing .
nothing ?
i ' ve been waiting for you , obi-wan . we meet again , at last . the circle is now complete . <continued_utterance> when i left you , i was but the learner ; now i am the master .
only a master of evil , <person> .
this is the best movie i ' ve ever seen in my life .
i don ' t get it .
no problem .
the vow of obedience .
no .
what about . <person> ? what has she told you about me ?
as it turns out , <person> had himself a young wife and new baby girl .
. said we can stay with them , but <person> ' s gettin ' out of the service next month , and they barely got enough room as it is . plus they got <person> workin ' double shifts and the baby cries half the night . i just don ' t know where we ' re gon na go .
hi !
hi .
i ' m fine .
where ' s the grey suitcase ?
why is that ?
i don ' t feel like running !
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
i still got one ace to play . <person> ' s got what i want . and i ' ve got what he wants .
<person> , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?
so i don ' t shop .
hey . what ' d he say ?
he said you ' re wonderful .
i ' ll have to . there ' s so much to be done .
you must let us know if we can help .
that a fact . now , is it a good play ?
yes , <person> , it is . it is a very good play .
no . no . you ' ve been officially depressed for like two years now , and you were always a negative guy anyway , even in college . now it ' s worse -- you ' re wasting away . teaching english to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote . your books .
i ' m working on it .
i know it is . it ' s life . experience . take a deep breath .
<person> !
i need a picture of <person> .
<person> . no can do .
well , it ' s princess leia , sir . she ' s been trying to get you on the communicator .
i turned it off . i don ' t want to talk to her .
i do not look at the downed man , <person> .
<person> , well .
no . i ' m not meeting him . absolutely not . you ever go fishing ? the bait always dies .
he won ' t get within fifty feet of you . the second we see him , the cuffs go on .
this one ' s alive !
take ahold of him where he can feel your hands , son . <person> to him .
she ' s <person> .
i ' m not <person> . i just . you ' re gon na think it ' s weird .
all the facts you need are right in front of you .
gim me a minute here . i think i ' ve got it .
what right do you have to take me for granted ?
what right ? do you want me to tell you ?
<person> . great arm . we signed him two years ago for fifteen .
<person> deal . he throw any junk ?
on the world i come from there ' s no light . no sun . beauty isn ' t important . i see now there ' s a world elsewhere .
<person> . we ' re not here to discuss your lack of a social life .
<person> .
<person>rrrr .
so where do you like to eat in paris ? e
oh , i love this place called <person> , it ' s just a little bistro on the left bank , best roast chicken in the universe .
i don ' t even know him . but i ' m having all these fantasies about a man i ' ve never met , who lives in seattle .
it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
i can live with that .
and you ' d be the boss .
the whole world plays baseball . my son ' s sixteen . <person> ' t touch a piece of wood that ' s not a bat . i never cared for the game , myself . too slow . <continued_utterance> your mom still in san pedro ?
yeah . with my sister and brother .
will you come out to dinner tonight with me and dad and the fiance ?
absolutely not . no .
the farpoint mission ? data , that was seven years ago .
i know . i just got it . it was very funny .
do you want an aisle or a window seat ?
window .
she ' ll be down in a minute .
what does she wan na see you about ?
you ' re doing this to liberate the remans ?
no race should be a slave to another . <continued_utterance> you don ' t trust me .
she was the greatest . you wouldn ' t know . you are too young . in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters . men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails . there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings . later , he strangled himself with it .
i sure turned into an interesting driveway .
how will the judging work ?
you get a possible ten points . three for your surfing , three for your style and four for the judge ' s overall impression of your ride . no one ' s ever gotten a ten . i ' m not really sure why .
<person> , that ' s bull . i ' m going for serene , they say some actually get there . <continued_utterance> prob ' ly low percentage on mothers . <continued_utterance> you try to center on the big issues , y ' know . what it ' s all about . what this whole trip has meant . but then , the really big issues keep swamping y .
<person> .
if there is anything i can do .
i have to do it myself .
everyone bumps into that ottoman .
hey , thanks for letting me .
you shouldn ' t have come back , <person> .
hey hey , it ' s that big <person> everybody ' s talking about . you don ' t look a thing like your pictures . tell me , have you really been thinking about world domination like they say ? code series lsu- <number> . activate . code series ess- <number> . activate . code series hhh- <number> . activate .

<person> to me ! you fucking bitch !

i know . but why would i do that ?
mr . <person> , you ' re always giving away beautiful things .
people can ' t help it , you know . they really can ' t . when they see you in this wheelchair , knowing what your life was life eight months ago , people are going to feel sorry for you . there ' s no way around it , <person> . you and i just met , and already i admire you . who wouldn ' t ? you ' re a brave tough smart kid . that ' s obvious . and i didn ' t know you , know how exciting and promising <continued_utterance> your life was before the accident . but listen , even i feel sorry for you .
you can only feel lucky that you didn ' t die for so long . then you start to feel . unlucky .
i understand .
. that . he sees that .

<person> around , fuck !
<person> ?
<person> ?
you didn ' t even see it .
i will see it next time .
that ring ' s so great . the green one .
<person> , i love you ! see ! i bought it for him , for his birthday .
. whatever . things are different here . it ' s not like new york , <person> .
yeah . here it ' s easier to avoid trouble . it ' s not like you like in compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day . <person> ' s mugging you on no subway . in new york the trouble finds you . out here you got ta go look for it .
this isn ' t about me anymore . <continued_utterance> prepare for a site-to-site transport .
<person> , we won ' t be able to bring you back . it ' s a one way trip . <person> , i don ' t know if the transporter --

it ' s the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve outrun imperial starships , not the local bulk-cruisers , mind you . i ' m talking about the big corellian ships now . she ' s fast enough for you , old man . what ' s the cargo ?
you believe in the same ideals we believe in ! the same ideals we are striving to make prominent .
if what you say is true , you should stay in the republic and help <person> put things right .
<person> , you ' re not watching your mouth !

he thinks you ' re a very suspicious character . he doesn ' t trust anybody ! not even himself . <person> is eager to get out of the room , and <person> is maddeningly slow in his movements .

when you said to commander riker . `` the clown can stay , but the ferengi in the gorilla suit has to go . `` <person> looks blankly at him for a moment .
what ?
not exactly .
what do you want to do ?
<person> ! did they ask for assistance ?
not yet .
<person> , is that smart .
why does she keep repeating the name ?
it is only ours you can know .
she loves me , <person> !
<person> , but they ' re all little wannabes .
i may not be a pro bowler , but i ' m no amateur man . <person> moves closer to theo .
you had her lie about that . that fancy-boy model !
worked . like a charm . believe this . <continued_utterance> she was beaten , and bloodied , and it was going to go on , uni .
i tell you what ?
what ?
<person> peel !
. which also is the secret to .
<person> stinks .
hi , guys .
i need some money . i ' m going to get the girl back .
what can i do ?
i was wondering if <person> could hang out here for a little while . <continued_utterance> i ' ve got this baby shower to go to and norah ' s working a job and my dad ' s incapacitated . do you mind ?
i guess not .
if i ' d known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to , i wouldn ' t have run out on you .
what are you trying to say , <person> ?
because . there was no way to win .
a no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face . has that never occurred to you ?
no ! i ' m saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother !
but , please , <person> , please - one step at a time ! i was born only yesterday ! .
ready .
time to go . <person> now .
<person> ' t sell the van .
<person> to . <person> ' t afford the payment .
<person> down , baby . you got ta double down on an eleven .
i know , but .
<person> ship ? you ' ve never heard of the millennium falcon ?
should i have ?
if he ' s not dead , he ' ll keep coming back .
he ' s dead <person> .
it wasn ' t a trick . i used to be an electrical engineer .
huh . <continued_utterance> and what were you doing out at the missile silo ?
follow that boat !
right you are , governor ! <continued_utterance> i know your face . are you an actor ?
and you didn ' t tell anyone ?
what ? why .
take them in to mr . <person> and tell him i must see him at once .
we ' ll dump them right in the judge ' s lap .
this is crazy . what were we going to do if that had been the ship ? we have two thirty calibre machine guns , three m <number> ' s and some handguns .
give it a rest , <person> .
you going to work all day ?
i ' m sorry , baby . this thing is just kicking my ass . i thought we had it with this one . <continued_utterance> . but the output went to shit after three seconds . i ' m thinking now it ' s the way i ' m matrixing the command hierarchies .
i am not afraid . read it ! norma <person> ! <person> ! sit down . is there enough light ?
i ' ve got twenty-twenty vision .
that ' s what i asked .
do i know hans <person> ?
here you go , you can have these back now . i confiscated them your first night here .
thank you darlin ' .
i don ' t know . i suppose until they find out who did it .
we ' ll be happier then , won ' t we ?
days .
you don ' t have to wait
<person> . you ' ve got the wrong man . for the first time . <person> really looks at him through her dark glasses . <continued_utterance> i had some trouble with my car . flat tire . i pulled into your garage till i could get a spare .
it is not . get out .
it ' s my belief that <person> was doing exactly what she ' d been doing for years . besides , the school board ' s insurance on <person> is minimal . a few million at the very most . the really deep pockets are to be found in the town , or in the company that made the bus .
you think someone else caused the accident ?
well . this ' ll be over soon . <person> ' s such a nut job , we ' re bound to pick him up soon .
i ' d like you to switch to the day shift , <person> . to be home for dinner . <person> insists that t . j . be home for dinner . that ' s why he ' s on the morning shift .
yes , please continue .
i was in space for a long time . then a ship belonging to the `` talosians '' picked me up . they asked me where i came from . i told them people called the `` pakleds '' took me from my homeworld . they are fat . <person> groans . time passes . <continued_utterance> then i opened my eyes and saw you .
we are cloaking !
what ?
no . i think it ' s ugly .
you ' re just a
you know what i want .
you ' re like some crazy man- you ' re obsessed .
yo !
<person> , come on .
<person> young girl like that . we ' ve all seen her pictures . what ' d you care how she dyed her hair ? what ' d you care . ? why ' s that make her a slut . ?
she . uh .
right .
cyborgs don ' t feel pain . i do . <person> ' t . do that . again .
<person> undressed in your own room , would you ?
i thought you ' d missed the train .
perfect .
here we go .
then pull yourself together . get this clown trained . i want him in the games until he dies playing .
yes . acknowledge , <person> .
the fbi received another fax .
<person> . they ' re still under the impression that we have him .
no monsters .
thank you .
i ' ve gotten <number> , <number> times smarter since then .
what do you want with the pentagon ?
-- not two judges from now , not two hours from now , not two minutes from now . these guys could split any second and you ' ve lost your best shot at --
<person> ' s working another warrant --
i want to know if anything ' s gone ?
calm down .
why ? what are you going to do ?
jump .
that is true . however , i believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse . for thirty-four years i have endeavored to become more `` human '' - to grow beyond my original programming . and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor . this emotion chip is the only answer .
all right . <continued_utterance> but at the first sign of trouble , i ' m going to deactivate it . agreed ?
i know . that ' s why i needed you .
. this is your favorite .
<person> ' , sweetheart .
go you huskies .
great .
i look stupid . i look stupid , don ' t i ? i look like i ' m trying too hard . i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i ' d look like i just got a haircut .
i ' ll take him anyway .
why ? <continued_utterance> you can ' t do it alone , ya know . it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make ' em look good .
for never dating anyone over <number> .
it ' s just not true .
i ' ve got twenty pages of notes . i ' ve got a pretty good character for the man .
could you write in plenty of back- ground action , so they ' ll need an extra assistant director ?
what ?
<person> . it was magic .
i do not speak english .
right . in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for <person> and the new driver will take . . this part . when you get to <person> , ask the driver , ' <person> , please ' .
would you do him ?
no .
no . but you were . she found you .
she found me ? what does that mean ? she stops . not wanting to go on . <continued_utterance> <person> , christina , are you going to spit it out ?
i don ' t know that <person> . he might get out . <person> ' s not bein ' straight with the witness , she could be in deep shit if she identifies him , and it ' s my job to convince her she won ' t be .
she ' s got to identify him .
partly . but there ' s a lot the insurance doesn ' t cover . that ' s one of the reasons we have a lawyer . to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest .
how will he do that ?
i ' m not here .
that ' s what i told them .
better her than me .
she ' s rich .
and <person> has a headache . do you have any tylenol ?
tylenol yes . .
<person> away the years of grime and soot and paint ovens . q-tips and water changing the history of western art . <person> colors .
<person> me to see it ?
organized rustling . well at least -- that ' s my belief . <person> was no friend of mine . too fond of taking the law into his own hands . but he had my sympathy . he ' d been harder hit than any of us . and on top of it all , he lost his foreman .
you mean , he quit on him ?
does he know that ?
well , i ' ll tell him , but i doubt that he thinks of it that way .
they were in pain .
it is the future you see .
you said you had it all lined up .
no , i didn ' t . what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum .
i fucked up .
. in what way was that ?
<person> ' t it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , <person> , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der <person> conscripted into the army and no one ' s heard from him since ?
that ' s an outrageous lie !
look at those nipples .
they ' re like baby toes .
but you only wore mascara when you and <person> went on romantic dates .
well <person> and i are just friends now , and that ' s no reason not to wear mascara .
you ' re damn right i am .
i do not get cold .
does it hurt when it happens ?
like you wouldn ' t believe . fecls like my brain is tearing in half .
so the grow ' em big and dumb on the farm planet , eh ? <person> ' d ?
i ' m going in for politics . you got ta be a citizen for that . so here i am .
well , except for the one girl .
what girl ?
all he wants is the attention . when he can ' t get to you , he ' ll try harder for a little while . then , he ' ll give up . it ' ll be no fun .
you think <person> would do that ? <continued_utterance> it ' s just she ' s younger . maybe she remembers how to do this . <continued_utterance> this ' ll work , huh ?
i did do that , didn ' t i ?
how do you feel about snakes ?
she sleeping with a teacher . ?
she says she isn ' t . i said she looked like a slut . she wants to fuck old guys , she should go to the regency . go all the way .
hey . you ' re not supposed to be in here .
<person> , sorry . are you <person> ?
it ' s <person> . she did this .
<person> gave me reason to live once you left . the flowers defined me .
mugging off <person> , saying that he ' s getting weak , losing all his gear .
what the fuck are you going about .
we ' re caught in a tractor beam ! it ' s pulling us in !
but there ' s got ta be something you can do !
no problem , master-c . if you ' ve seen one consumer <person> . what ' s up ?
it ' s our friend the boy detective .
ah ! that ' s better , that ' s better .
<person> .
<person> . it ' s your baby now .
i ' m not good enough to write it alone . we ' ll have to do it together .
company ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> company ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number> <continued_utterance> what do you do when the table ' s a mess ?

where the hell have you been ? it ' s .
that shit you spilled all over yourself , idiot .
oh shit . <continued_utterance> what the hell is this ?
<person> you are lucky we aren ' t worm food after your performance , i think buying a tart ' s mobile palace is a little fuckin rich . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean that your mum was a tart . i just meant .
save your breath for cooling your porridge . i ' ll bet you for it .
wait a minute . where are you taking me ?
i better just take you back where you belong . <continued_utterance> hold on tight .
doing what , exactly ?
i don ' t know what you mean .
<person> .
when do you leave ?
hi . x
we came to take you to lunch .
no funnier than you sloggin ' through it , just to deliver a letter from a woman .
when are we gon na get around to readin ' it ?
what was i supposed to do ?
you ' re supposed to fucking help me , man , fucking do something .
maybe it ' s a little long and maybe there are some repetitions . but you ' re not a professional writer .
i wrote that with my heart .
yep .

it ' s been a week .
i ' m going to buy you a calendar .
i ' m sorry , ms . <person> is <continued_utterance> miss , i <continued_utterance> excuse me . if jackie <person> were coming back to the editorial staff , i would be frankly delighted . and i . would be the first . to know . <person> . in the midst of hysterical children .
thank you for your time .
you don ' t believe me ? you don ' t fucking believe me ?
of . course i do . i just thought . i could get you another <continued_utterance> test . in case the one you got . was wrong .
do you know anybody with a room for rent ?
but i ' ll ask around , let you know if i hear of anything . <continued_utterance> you and <person> used to play baseball together ?
check your driver ' s license .
<person> . got it . <person> , the way i see it , i ' m stuck here , right ? i mean , i ' m here or i ' m target practice . so here ' s the deal -- i don ' t bug you , you don ' t bug me . i ' ll catch up on some sleep , watch some tube , lay back and lay low . so just get me a key and show me to my room , and do not disturb . <person> ?
i better get dressed again in case anybody ' s just a half hour late . <continued_utterance> okay . we ' re okay here . why can ' t everything be like sod ? there ' s no wait , no dung , nothing you have to do right and yet it ' s perfect . it covers up all your dirt and makes things immediately pretty . then , the miracle , if you just give it time , it roots and you can ' t tell it from the real thing . no reaction . nothing to say .
<person> ? oh sure . i , uh . well , no , i don ' t have anything particular to say .
i just did . he didn ' t know we were one payment away . you didn ' t tell him mr . <person> promised my fath .
i was s ' posed to <continued_utterance> get out of here .
<person> .
stay there , my man .
i mean first you ' ll pretend not to care , not call - whatever , and then , eventually , you really won ' t care .
unless she comes back first .
no . i must ' ve gotten in there by mistake , i -
who programmed you ? <continued_utterance> you ' re in trouble , pal . big trouble . but if you tell us who put you up to it , you could make it easy on yourself . come on , who ' s your user ?
but you can ' t kick me out ! guys want to kill me ! you ' re a nun ! a big nun ! <person> ' t you supposed to have compassion ? for the wayward sheep ? i mean , i ' m a major sinner ! all-time great ! hall of fame ! <person> ' t i , like , your dream come true ? your olympic event ? mother superior stares at christy .
<person> , perhaps you are correct .
i ' ve been in this room for eight years , <person> . i know they will never , ever let me out while i ' m alive . what i want is a view . i want a window where i can see a tree , or even water . i want to be in a federal institution , away from <person> - and i want a view . i ' ll give good value for it . <person> could do that for me , but he won ' t . you persuade him .
who killed your patient ?
i believe so .
now you ' ve testified that the deceased was a heavy man , and hard to bring out of the net . <continued_utterance> is it possible his head struck the transom , or the stern gunnel , or the net roller , as you were bringing him in ?
i am . grateful for what you have given me . but i still do not wish to be assimilated .
a universe of sensation is waiting for you . don ' t you want to explore it . with me ?
with or without the rest of the fleet ?
a diplomatic mission . we ' ve been invited , believe it or not . seems there ' s been some kind of internal political shakeup . the new praetor , someone called <person> , has requested a federation envoy .
they ' ve already been identi- fied . there ' s no doubt .
of , god . <person> . kiddo , i ' m so sorry .
do as i tell you !
<person> , we ' ve received the transponder signal .
<person> out for that one . she ' s got a great average , but she ' s looking for a prince . and , believe me , she ' s <continued_utterance> kissed a lotta tadpoles . <person> , i been thinking about your problem . i ' m not the guy to sponsor you . it would be unethical . but , there is something i could do for you . putt-putt golf .
putt-putt golf ?
no , i ' m an actor .
oh yeah ? what kind of stuff ?
eight o ' clock .
it ' s five thirty now . you could come get me now and take me to the police tonight and then go to <person> ' s --
what could you do ?
anything . you ' re lying on your side , asleep , i could . stick a needle in your ear .
where did you get this ?
in <person> ' things .
so you think i ' m inhuman .
no . i think you ' re formidable .
norma , i can ' t take it . you ' ve bought me enough .
<person> up . i ' m rich . i ' m richer than all this new hollywood trash .
and my use of the word `` obnoxiousity . ``
yes .
you don ' t smoke .
only when i ' m worried . i don ' t worry much .
we should have gone a long time ago .
oh , god . <person> brother ' s in love .
<person> ' s put him on . who else ?
<person> .
whoa , whoa , whoa . i said i ' d drop you home , but i ' m not taking you on your sleazoid rounds . i ' ve already pulled twelve hours today .

<person> , who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- because <person> threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn ' t --
<person> , it ' s <person> . it ' s a joke .

i don ' t think so . only <person> .
why not ? they seem to have a box of old coverings here .
i ' d like you to beg me on your knees for a kiss . just for fun .
why am i doing this ?
yes , i ' m trying to find a planet system called <person> . it doesn ' t seem to show upon any of the archive charts .
<person> ? it ' s not a system i ' m familiar with . let me see . <continued_utterance> are you sure you have the right co-ordinates ?
i don ' t know . when i met my wife , it was so clear . i just knew .
what was it that made you know ?
so she wasn ' t just a bitch in high heels ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t stress . she mighta heard worse from her momma . i ' m only guessin ' .
some people probably thought <person> was bad clear through .
it ' s not your fault .
sex killers act alone . so there ' s no information on the street , which is how cases get made . cops know they ' ll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene . <continued_utterance> and anyway , nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker . they ' re roadkill . <continued_utterance> see , it ' s all about what they see walking in . a dead hooker , handcuffs , penetration . they ' ll see a trick gone wrong . <person> kill . the kind you never solve .
what ' s the matter with you ?
i ' m fine .
no . here is a pattern . two days ago <person> is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered . yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks , and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november <number> th . we look at hotel records and we see <continued_utterance> <number> people .
<number> people .
no . business of a kind .
i don ' t mean to pry ; i ' m just really nosey .

then forget me .
your daughter <person> was sold by your wife to a child pornographer . for $ <number> . <continued_utterance> but she ' s fine . we got her . and the doc says she wasn ' t touched . yet . if you catch my drift .
that ' s . the good n .
your first training voyage , mr .
yes , sir .
where was she ? when you saw her , where was she exactly ?
on the cushion right next to you .
<person> !
there ' s a rat in your purse .
how ' d you get your voice back ?
the day my <person> died . the truth exploded out of me like a vision . my <person> and <person> had been arguing , there was a gunshot and my father was dead .
i can just feel my spirits soar .
well , i don ' t do it for just anybody . <continued_utterance> there can ' t be any wrong in this , ha .
years i ' ve got . what i don ' t have are the rocks . pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim .

aww . he got away ?
what time ' s this party tonight ?
and i ' ve got a witness ! your mr . <person> saw the crime .
he told you that ! ?
we ' re better off by ourselves .
but it ' s the only proof we have to the future . about the war and all that .
you name <person> ?
here , officer , take me in . i ' m clean . i didn ' t do it . got a ticket once in jersey . that ' s all .
i thought you liked sweet things .
all the players are really good .
<person> . when did we establish that <person> was real ?
o ' <person> thinks so .
they think over a hundred thousand . they ' re just estimates . but we held strong .
how do they know it ' s over ?
. i never know a man who can put himself in my place like you do .
i don ' t know . you introduce two jews in the desert and wait five thousand years . then , bingo , somebody else who can see trouble coming but can ' t do anything about it .
i ' ll make this as simple as i can , <person> . they disappeared .
i don ' t care where you ' re from you just can ' t disappear into thin air .
okay , you ' ve got my attention . now tell me what this is all about .
i need your help .
<person> . no problem . i understand .

<person> this plate was already fixed .
<person> ?

<person> ' s about as far as i ' ve ever gone . is this person a he or a she ?
i got twenty or so in here tonight .
these guys have got ta be the quill , <person> . we can ' t afford to rank the joint .

not if it means killing over two hundred million people . i wonder . did your wife <person> know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder ? <continued_utterance> when you tucked your children into bed . do you suppose they ever suspected that their father would one day kill millions as casually as he kissed them goodnight ?

excuse me ? ! i am in charge of security here , <person> ' <person> .
<person> , my life is at risk , and this is my home . i know it very well . that is why we ' re here . i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance .
dr . <person> . good . we ' re en route to you and should be there in three days .
en route ? why ? we weren ' t expecting you for another three months . has something happened ? <continued_utterance> i still don ' t under --

my pupils weren ' t properly dilating and , um , not doing the opposite .
i suppose not . she is limited . <person> . there ' s this single mother who lives downstairs . i find her really deep and sad .
tell me .
do you think it ' s a possibility ?
yes .
<person> . big ears , too ?
no . but they stand out , a little . like this .
. terrible thing , grief . <continued_utterance> . you want to comfort them , but you don ' t know how . i always think it ' s better to <person> .
a relative ?
the chick digs you . she lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published .
now i ' ve got another lie to live down . thanks , <person> .
it ' s forever you know .
<person> . is that the good thing or the bad thing ?
he will not be permanently damaged .
<person> vader , what about <person> and the wookiee ?
you don ' t believe that . i ' ve been to places you haven ' t . i ' ve crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying . and when i do , that veil gets lifted for just a second . and what ' s there is real . maybe it ' s a vision of the next world , but i can see it .
you can see it . but you can never get there without our help .
is something wrong .
may i get you a drink ?
well , if anything like this happens again , we should go talk to <person> .
<person> .
i left the number of the restaurant i ' ll be at if there ' s any emergency .
<person> .
all right , i ' ll be right there , <person> .
i ' m sorry , sir , but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter .
that all you can say ?
no , nyet , negatory , not on your tintype , no way .
<person> .
eh . you keep it . i ' ve had enough . <continued_utterance> what ' s the matter ?
four hundred years old . you don ' t find many with the lens still intact .
uh -- what are they ?
nothing . i don ' t know . everything was normal . no changes at all .
when did it happen ?
i need a wrestler with a masters .
what ' s this ? <continued_utterance> from you ? <continued_utterance> is it wrestling tights ?
why ?
i got ta thing . just drop me off here .
examination and interview materials are confidential . we ' ve never violated an applicant ' s trust , and we never will .
you want to see a violation ? this is a violation . <continued_utterance> her name is <person> , she was just id ' d . i met her on a slab in west virginia . and sometime tomorrow , or tomorrow night , he ' s going to do the same thing to <person> .
has been wounded by her heat . by her infidelities .
anybody here seen <person> ?
<person> out from here .
i love the fact you brought <person> with you and no clothes . <person> says you wash the same shirt out every night .
<person> told me all about it .
<person> told you all about <person> ?
no don ' t touch me , don ' t you dare .
i ' m sorry .
and i run him .
we share him .
that ' s antonia . <continued_utterance> wait a minute . <continued_utterance> the future . what are you talking about ? this is the past . <continued_utterance> this is nine years ago . the day i told her i was going back to <person> . <continued_utterance> these were ktarian eggs -- her favorite . i was cooking them to soften the blow . and i gave her this .
i know how real this must seem to you , but it ' s not . this isn ' t really your house . we ' ve both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus .
at the end of the day , i ' m nothin ' but a sap , a stupid old sap , standing on a bridge in paris , crying my eyes out . <continued_utterance> look who gets to be the girl . <continued_utterance> anything else . .
<person> ?
. they said they were going to take care of me .
i ' m going to take care of you . you hold on , now .
they need me back in miami , but i ' d really like it if you could join me . the marlin fishing ' s supposed to be great off the keys . <continued_utterance> the change would do you a world of good .
<person> bail , <person> will remain behind bars at least until the time of the trial -- angle on neil , watching .
that ' s not what i meant .
i know . <continued_utterance> you want a drink ?
you thought we were a different planet ? !
no . my ship was doing a map of all the suns and .
not at all , <person> .
. you going home ?
you should write something about this .
about what ?
no !
i ' m sorry , <person> .
i went for a walk . i had to think .
all night ? you smell weird . are you wearing lipstick ?
<person> ! you ' re so . different from the other sisters . sometimes , well . sometimes you sound more like a layperson .
<person> .
yes . that ' s him . that is the man i saw murder <person> in the parking lot outside my gym . no doubt . now will you go catch him , please ?
thank you . i just needed you to say it .
do you talk with your mom ?
it ' s been awhile . she didn ' t want me looking for my dad .
someone i just met . he wants me to meet him for a drink .
at <number> : <number> ? that ' s a bootie call .
is there shrimp on it ?
yes .
and some good cheer .
how about some <person> pussy , guys ? anybody for a quick piece ?
i like .
i was beginning to feel like a goldfish .
. tell me i ' m wrong . <continued_utterance> . what -- ?
you believe in anything , <person> -- ?
you know , seeing you sure brings back a few things .
yeah .
it ' s lovely .
a spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the waterford huskies .
<person> , what a woman .
<person> ' t do very well , did you ?
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more , then i shall be the sorrier . <continued_utterance> the queen commands a comedy , <person> for <person> .
a comedy ! what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom , sick with love ?
is it ?
<person> , the message said <person> . `` my name is <person> '' . my name isn ' t <person> .
what ?
i got ta use the phone .
next time we meet , i ' ll probably have to salute you . what about you , son ?
infantery , sir .
yes , i did .
thank you , <person> . i feel so much better just having blown this off .
well , i suppose when you put it that way .
i , too , came up through the ranks when at age <number> , i began my service here at water world learning from this great man .
you have to give them your phone number or they won ' t let you go on the air . <continued_utterance> `` dear sleepless in seattle : i am an swf '' -- what is that ?
<person> . something you don ' t know . it ' s a single white female .
it is not mr . de<person> in person . it is someone by the name or <person> . he says it ' s very important .
certainly it ' s important . it ' s important enough for mr . de<person> to call me personally . the idea of having an assistant call me !
they ' re for sale if you want them .
let me see your identification .
but isn ' t the
but <continued_utterance> like you couldn ' t believe .
mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens . <person> . <person> ?
we ' re going to have to stop for gas soon .
<person> , <person> . <person> shame , your horse comin ' in last and all . <person> , i sure do love that horse of mine . i believe i owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when i see him .
give him some ' a your cigarettes instead , cheap bastard .
leave us alone , stephens . leave the people of this town alone . you can ' t help .
you can help each other . several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit . your case as an individual will be stronger if i ' m allowed to represent you together as a group .
good news , kid . i pulled a few strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up . we ' ll be in court in a couple of days .
that soon ?
it ' s not your career -- it ' s mine . i kind of hoped to get in on this deal . i don ' t want to be a reader all my life . i want to write .
<person> if i crossed you up .
what is this ? --
what do you mean ?
can i help you ? <person> , i ' m really busy .
<person> , um , my dad ' s a butcher , do you need a hand ?
what do you mean , `` nobody knows '' ?
well , uh , you see .
morning , folks . fill her up ?
. gas .
raise <number> .
<person> ya and raise three .
and when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ?
what telegram ?
<person> ' t believe what a difference her nose makes .
well i think it ' s a mistake ; taken away all her character .
you ' re going to miss the train .
no , i ' m not .
my father , uh . he die .
oh , <person> , honey . i ' m so sorry .
<person> him ! dr . fine snaps off the radio .
<person> ?
where are you ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! <continued_utterance> that was him .
he called you at home ?
oh , miranda , please , i haven ' t figured out all the details yet , but i ' m a smart girl and i ' m sure i ' ll figure out something i ' m comfortable with .
i just want to make sure you ' re being smart here --
<person> ! hey , guys ! <person> up a minute . <continued_utterance> well , uh , i think it just really rocks that the football team picked me as their , y ' know , uh , candidate .
we love you , <person> !
i ' m leaving you .
oh , thank god . i thought you were robbing our own home , because frankly , that ' s insane . i mean , what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home ? i don ' t mean to meddle , but isn ' t it better to rob other peoples ' homes ? start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth .
i had a witness , i would .
a witness to what ?
well , may it just be so .
when we get to <person> .
no . i called the school and had someone find them in a yearbook . here ' s the original owner ' s name . but it could have been through a dozen pawn shops since then .
<person> , can i take you back to quantico with me ?
<person> ' t `` yes , <person> '' me , <person> . you ' re outta line . this is strictly homicide .
<person> , i got this friend .
the poor thing . six years ?
. and she ' s with someone else .
. a ridiculously forgiveness ? for what , exactly ? <continued_utterance> how much time have you got ? let ' s start with this morning . <continued_utterance> i ' m sure that didn ' t upset her .
i was in there in him .
it ' ll be over soon . i can get you money .
it ' s not going to get better , okay ? <continued_utterance> they arrested mr . <person> , because his farm is near a navy transmitter . and his family can ' t leave their house .
do you have music up there ?
yes .
probably . it looks like a mudflap .
i prefer there not be a scar .
`` bazoomer dot com . ``
i can ' t put a computer in a movie shot in <number> . you wan na tell me how i ' m gon na do that ?
is that . ?
<person> . it ' s a liquid explosive . there ' s fourteen canisters of it . <person> detonator . <person> phone signal closes the circuit and boom .
you were the road manager for a group i sorta never heard of , started your own record label at <number> , sold it at <number> , then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the <number> nd largest hip hop label in the world .
it ' s exhausting just hearing about it .
i don ' t think your new outfit suits you , theo .
<person> ? i kinda like it .
well , if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn ' t he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats ?
because . he wanted to them to be punished .
<person> , that ' s all deductible . you get to write that off .
yes sir , <person> was a regular handr block . in fact , he got so busy at tax time , he was allowed a staff .
i wish you ' d get out of my clothes .
you said i could pick out a jacket and i just . <person> .
never needed one . not much to it , is there ?
so why now ? why me ?
attachment is forbidden . possession is forbidden . compassion , which i would define as unconditional love , is central to a jedi ' s life , so you might say we ' re encouraged to love .
you have changed so much
hi .
you going to ask me in ? <continued_utterance> thought you might like this .
you ' re out of line , starling , and you ' re off this case . back to quantico .
<person> , mr . <person> instructed me -
no !
<person> will be meeting a very sticky end . and it ' s one murder i ' m really looking forward to .
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project . we are in little danger of being left alone for long . you ' ll need to do something . otherwise they ' ll be sending someone out to recover you .
<person> said he thinks <person> should be destroyed .
that wouldn ' t look good . maybe i should just pick the one with the least dirty sounding name .
weapons of ass destruction ' s out then .
i should say something in this about magic .
what ?
`` i got it . `` just like that . `` i got it '' -- like he was picking up the check for coffee or something .
it sounds perfect .
<person> , why you ' re the best smuggler in the business . you ' re too valuable to fry . he was only relaying my concern at your delays . he wasn ' t going to blast you .
i think he thought he was . next time don ' t send one of those twerps . if you ' ve got something to say to me , come see me yourself .
maybe it doesn ' t matter if he ' s a good dancer cause it ' s a slow song , if that ' s what he ' s afraid of .
no . maybe that ' s not the case . maybe she shouldn ' t be such a smug little shit because she ' d be surprised at what a good dancer he really is , but it ' s been a long time and he doesn ' t know if he ' s ready to .
what are you talking about ? you ' re gon na be a great mom . i know you will .
it ' s not that , <person> .
and all i ' m asking for is the truth . that would take five minutes . for all i know , you caused the explosions at the silo . and now you ' re trying to steal <person> ' s ship .
i am not a thief .
what is thy bidding , my master ?
there is a great disturbance in the force .
so , what are you doing tonight ?
shooting .
you said <person> was older .
by three minutes . they were very different boys .
what ? ! ?
it ' s my job to protect you . i said it ' s too dangerous . you ' re not going , and that ' s final !
<person> . is he around ?
yeah , he ' s around somewhere .
did i say i was selling ? but if i was , i ' d have to figure you want ' em real bad . <person> charge a sall fortune , maybe . <continued_utterance> then again . maybe you ' d want your battery back .
the battery ' s in , that ' s done with . besides , you ' d do the same for m .
to free terrance and <person> .
but you guys . it ' s <person> steak .
what is it , <person> ?
what happens on page <number> ? have you ever read page <number> ?
no eggs ? you sure ?
french toast .
go ahead . ladies first .
no , why don ' t -- <person> nudges him forward .
because this movie has naughty language , and it might make you kids start using bad words .
listen you son of a bitch , if you don ' t let us in to see this movie i ' m gon na kick you square in the nuts .
america . she iz a beetch that sheets on her own children . <person> and <person> look at each other confused .
this is the <person> . he will accompany you to the prison where <person> and <person> are . he is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom .
<person> ahead .
<person> to find doors in this place .
i ' m cool , baby . they ' re gon na give <person> a room , some breakfast , maybe <person> ' s singing .
i ' m serious . this is how you do it . i ' m telling you .
for sure .
where ' s your program ? won ' t it miss you ?
it was kind of like clicking , maybe a language wasn ' t it ?
listen to this . a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning . when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange ' clicking gibberish ' .
uh . when i boy . um . i don ' t know --
tell me in spanish .
you ' ve said that before , yaar . prem finishes pissing . <person> over to the washbasins , runs the taps and washes his hands .
no , i really don ' t .
oh , daddy . you know how jealous people get .
i ' d almost believe that . but i was behind the first aid station when you said the `` princess '' line . this park exists because the kids here work hard . they need to be treated fairly . they need to see you are just another lifeguard .
i said , all systems have been alerted to your presence , sir . the main entrance seems to be the only way in or out ; all other information on your level is restricted .
open up in there !
i ' m sorry . i get why you are upset . it might not look it but i am good at getting things . doing something about it is something else . i was going to talk to you before i actually gave her the money . but maybe i should have checked before i started the whole thing . i know what it ' s like when you feel your kid is being messed with . i get the message . it won ' t happen again . it ' s late . i ' m sure we ' d all like .
to what . sleep ? if this was small enough to be helped by some little apology , i would be a fool to bring it up . i need to say more no matter what the result . i need to be impolite . you leave someone else ' s child alone . it ' s simple , no ? it is too easy for children to feel contradictions . it encourages questioning their parents . and that makes them less safe . your wife takes her for rides and changes her hair . you give her money . here . <person> back the money ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <continued_utterance> i did not mean to be angry to you - only emotional .
<person> ! <person> ! <person> ' t do this , <person> . come on , give me a sign here . <continued_utterance> not much time .
<person> . <person> .
- people named <person> . this <person> guy has a black son he makes live in the park -
mr . <person> has what ?

yes ! remember ? you asked me for an application ? i introduced you to the manager ?
oh , yeah . <person> , that must ' ve been a while ago .
wait ! !
oh . my . god .
why of me , <person> ?
well , sentimental reasons . something to remind me of you when we ' re not together .
then why ' d you cut it last week ?
i thought it was time for a new look . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
what ' s your specialty ?
whips . orange whips .
i know our stated policy is not to negotiate with terrorists , but --
<person> , we can ' t release him because we don ' t have him . we never had him . and besides that , he ' s dead .
my god . they ' re really from another world ?
that ' s right . and they ' re going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship .
melton , <person> . <person> .
<person> , sir .

that ' s possible . he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion .
no , you ' re not , nobody thinks i ' m anything special . only my mother . my father hates me .
you must be imagining things .
i think i broke my hand .
really ?
you ' re unnerved because you ' ve spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you , and suddenly your subconscious is an open book . we are , for the first time , experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own . that proves that --
-- we are not sure of that . we are not sure we aren ' t all hallucinating .
no . i think we went to different schools . <continued_utterance> . put the bandana on .

what you ' re about to do is no different from when the borg destroyed your world .
you ' re right . and there was a time when i wouldn ' t have hurt anyone . then the borg came . and they showed me that if there is one constant in this universe , it ' s death . afterwards , i began to realize that none of it mattered . we ' re all going to die anyway . it ' s only a question of how and when . you will too , captain . you might contract a fatal disease . you might die in battle . <continued_utterance> . or burn to death in a fire . <continued_utterance> you looked surprised . but you shouldn ' t be . i ' ve been to the nexus , captain . i know things about people . <person> ' t you beginning to feel time gaining on you ? it ' s like a predator . it ' s stalking you . you can try to outrun it with doctors . medicines . new technologies . but in the end , time is going to hunt you down . and make the kill .
<person> , if i have to wait too long on the sidewalk my feet get cold . and if i sit too long on those stone steps , my --
<person> ' t worry . since you told <person> about the icebox , you ' re her favorite charity . she ' ll send the butler out with something to defrost you .

i ' m just trying to understand what ' s going on . <continued_utterance> how have you lived the last ten years ? did you love anyone ? <continued_utterance> did you think about me ? <continued_utterance> but we fought .
<person> in bed with them ? that would too much to wish for .

a hotel would ' ve been fine . we ' ll have to tell mr greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched .
still time to change your mind . blue skies . fun in the sun .
just not a traveller , <person> .

i believe it was because of another letter i ' d written to <person> lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies .
we feel so guilty . <person> could ' ve been killed by that intruder . he was very understanding -

ulcers .
<person> .
well , well , now look who ' s got something that works .
and you didn ' t even take via-

you don ' t mean it . it ' s just for show .
it doesn ' t sound natural when i curse .
i ' m sorry ?
it ' s not a strength of his . i ' m noticing that lately .

you trust him . he ' s got that strength . you ' d die in a second for <person> .
well , at least i know what to name him . i don ' t suppose you ' d know who the father is ? so i don ' t tell him to get lost when i meet him .

<person> , that ' s him , that ' s the guy . you know what else the little creep did ? he kept files , close on <number> , <number> files . and you know what ' s in those files ?

second question . what did <person> pay you per acre ?
we ' re wrapping it up .
three grand just to have the asshole wiped up off the floor . can you believe that ?
myths don ' t kidnap little boys . do they ?
do you ?
what ' s there to talk about ? he ' s just a boy .
a boy ? have you seen the way he looks at you ?
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?

<person> means you accept . <continued_utterance> part of me hasn ' t quit yet . and the other part is still pretty outraged . when it ' s not terrified . <continued_utterance> i ' m thinking . do i know you well enough to really chew you out ?
no .

. it ' s a wedding ring .
my friend the clitoris told me .

<person> . someone broke into my office . minutes ago .
at the art gallery ?
english muffin . how do you do it ?
you see someone you like , you get a feeling about them , you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
i seem to have found it .
general <person> , years ago you served my father in the clone wars . now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire . i regret that i am unable to present my father ' s request to you in person , but my ship has fallen under attack and i ' m afraid my mission to bring you to <person> has failed . i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r <number> unit . my father will know how to retrieve it . you must see this droid safely delivered to him on <person> . this is our most desperate hour . help me , obi-wan <person> , you ' re my only hope .
he ' s on a build up to detonation !
how soon --
hi .
i ' m <person> .

<person> is too .
and i ' m not quite human . so what am i ? what do you see ? do you see a life you might have led ? lost youth never to be recaptured ?

<person> up ! <person> up ! <person> up ! what ' s the matter with you , man ? shut up !
i dunno . seems kind of silly to me .
it ' s a big deal . every girl wants to date you . every guy wants to be you . special privileges . we all wear standard uniforms . the <person> gets to be creative . you ever see the cowboy hat <person> wears ?
i don ' t know ; the shed . what do you think ?
i recommend preserving it .

i told you i ' d make it someday , <person> .
this r <number> unit of your seems a bit beat up . do you want a new one ?
<person> . betty <person> . and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me .

<person> . then let ' s do something besides driving me home where my daughter isn ' t .
i need to keep my hand in .
well , <person> needs to be filled .
you ever get hot ?
no .
telling me what ?
it ' s quantum physics . <person> algebra . parabolic calculus . it would take weeks to explain .
everyone has a destiny . and this isn ' t yours .
who in the world are you ?
typically , the subject being copied is terminated .
terminated ! ? shit ! <person> didn ' t you tell me ? we got ta right now !
that fellow is annoying . he ' s in here every week . <person> clockwork . <continued_utterance> there . i think that should --

ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore <person> che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor greenleaf , il quale era l ' unica persona al memento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor <person> .
he ' s taken over the case because . they ' re annoyed the previous chap let <person> . disappear when he was the only , he was the only suspect in freddie ' s murder .

<person> , i guess maybe i do , sir .
<person> , good morning .
you as mad at me as <person> ' cause of what happened ?
what is that , a planet ? `` where is awareness ? '' `` awareness is '' `` did you make a journey ? '' `` yes . did you make a journey ? '' `` yes '' <continued_utterance> great , okay . ask him about his weapons .
that ' s smart . <person> ' s talk about guns and violence .
i spent all evening on the mainframe . <person> altered or destroyed most of his patient histories , prior to capture . no record of anyone named <person> . but `` <person> '' sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce . i tracked it down in the library ' s catalogue of national yellow pages . it ' s a mini-storage facility outside baltimore , where <person> had his practice .
well ? why aren ' t you there right now ?
so you see , the point and the theme of the film is kept intact . and of course , the mpaa didn ' t cut out any of the graphic violence . what did you think ?
oh man , i ' m gon na need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie .
<person> windu ! <continued_utterance> you have fought gallantly . worthy of recognition in the history archives of the jedi order . now it is finished . <person> - and your lives will be spared .
we will not be hostages for you to barter with <person> .
hold on , hold on , i ' m looking it up --

i ' m so ashamed of myself . <continued_utterance> oh , <person> . i wish we had this when we were young . and all the years in between . so many years , so fast . <continued_utterance> what did we do ?
wait a minute ! <person> is doing his federal and he isn ' t inferior . he ' s the smartest kid at school !
<person> . <person> ' s a fine boy .
<person> says it ' s from you .
well , don ' t make him disappear before i see him . <continued_utterance> oh , look at this . <continued_utterance> that ' s you and me . our first photo as a couple .
it wasn ' t a slump .
what was it then ?
ah yes , indeed -- i beg your pardon ? <continued_utterance> i don ' t remember inviting that young man . who is he ?
a friend of the darvilles .
oh boy . you like it there ?
i mean , i ' m going back .
he went home twenty minutes ago . <person> , where do you think <person> is ?
i bet <person> is in a deep grave with square corners like <person> and ford . <person> looks like all the victims . maybe he ' s subconsciously killing himself .
ellie , you know i think it ' s about time we got outa this place , get us a house of our own . we can afford it now .
amen to that . the supermarket ' s full of assholes .
yeh , she ' s . i ' ll get you <person> first , it ' s past his bedti .
how ' s she doing with <person> ?

i ' m afraid you ' ll hurt him .
<person> , <person> , this is dr . <person> on <person> .
i ' m probably not interested in whatever you ' re selling .
that was a little joke .
<person> . that is a difficult concept . it is not logical .
it ' s too late .
you can still make a choice ! make the right one now !
this man would walk through fire for <person> , gladly , any day of the week .

the title is about a lot of things . <continued_utterance> are you gay , <person> ?

it ' s working .
<person> down , sweetheart . we ' re taking off !

my , my , my , my , my , my question was : why would a young girl want to go out with an older man like me ? and , if you could `` answer '' that .

i have consciousness , but i am not mortal . <person> ' t you see why i ' m going crazy ?
you have to remember that i love you , that ' s all that matters --
<person> <number> . i get my license in september .
it ' s just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you . most guys your age that can swim are guards .
and what happened to von der <person> ?
i have no idea .
that ' s weird . was he adopted , switched at birth ?
listen for a minute . there was a match . <person> is mrs . <person> ' s biological son .

it was a clearance .
you know , <person> bowled .
how do you like it , <person> ?
the ramp ?
sure , great , just don ' t be surprised if some day <person> digs out your <number> and buries a slug or two in your ass .
please . the woman can ' t even step on a spider .
you know what this tape could do if it gets out .
i ' ve got a good idea , yeah .
<person> . <person> .
i know . i write like a child .
did you get it ?
no -- but i don ' t think it ' s gon na matter much -- you go on back to the k . c . and i ' ll be out in the mornin ' and take you with me to <person> to see the district judge .
really , captain , it was a lovely toast .
the least i could do for you , <person> . besides , you know me .
aw lady , if i looked like you , i ' d --
c ' mon . c ' mon .
it is , isn ' t it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life .
<person> takes a hand .
why me ? <person> probably has lotsa enemies to choose from .
i need somebody respectable . but not completely legit . what i ' m gon na do isn ' t very legal .
now , that young conductor what ' s his name ? that miracle kid , you know who i mean . <person> ! but you called him something else . c ' mon . what did you call von <person> ? <continued_utterance> say it . <continued_utterance> i ' ll say it , then . ' little k . ' is that right ? you couldn ' t even bear to say his name ! <person> rises angrily and starts to pace .

blackmail . that ' s all it is .
i call it keeping your promise . we said if i ever needed some cooperation from you .

i thought you said there wasn ' t any damage done in the crash ?
i saw his <person> , you know . <person> .
yes , i saw it .
and whom would you call ?
oh , i don ' t know . <person> ?
because you are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen .
is that so ? but what do you think of <person> ?
one moment , please . <continued_utterance> as you can see on your screen , subject weapon does not exist in any known culture . markings can not be identified . <person> self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society .
excuse me ? could you try again please ?

i ' m so sorry .

what ' s your hurry ? <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
my hurry ? that ' s funny , coming from you ! you ' re the one who ' s in a hurry , aren ' t you ?
and you saved us a fortune . do you know what our bill would ' ve been at that little eye-tie store front ?
and we picked up two million dollars . one billionth of a percent commission is -
a part of what ? <person> , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party . <continued_utterance> page <number> . <continued_utterance> you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how . fortunate .
<person> , so i just got things started . but you could build on that . you could keep it going .
chi , you lazy chutiy , chi ! <continued_utterance> ah , <person> ! cracked it ?
<person> , <person> .
could you tell me when ' s the next train ?
n ' about ten minutes . what was your movie about ? <continued_utterance> no , of course , you don ' t want to talk about it .
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with <continued_utterance> i ' m curious . the d- <number> that was refitted into the deceased ' s well . was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant ' s ?
i believe so .
<person> .
<person>rrrr .
if it was a quarrel , how come you had the gun right there ?
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time ? where did he come from ? who is he ?
i don ' t know how you did it , but whatever it was , keep doing it .
i just sat and listened .
well , no sense beating around the bush . <person> , we came to see you because we ' re both worried about you .
no , <person> , that was the scam that <person> and i worked out because we were worried about you .
we should find who did it .
this is un-fucking-believable . i have to look good tonight !
i feel so close to you .
<person> , look , i like you very much .
no !
no , because i had only one intention . my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics .
<person> , why won ' t you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
well , yeah , sure .
i didn ' t hear anyone invite you to sit down . <continued_utterance> sit there . <continued_utterance> i want you to understand why you ' re here . you ' re automatically banned from public life under control council directive no <number> . we ' re here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission . you understand that ?
i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria .
what ?
mum and dads .
murder .
the hell you say .
in bridal couture . it ' s a once in a lifetime opportunity - so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes .
<person> -- i ' m so very flattered but --
is that so ?
i lent it to a friend of mine .
what do you mean ?
i mean i ' m a wheelchair girl now . it ' s hard to pretend i ' m a beautiful rock star . not like you used to tell me . remember , <person> ? all the people that were going to discover me ? where are they now ? <continued_utterance> he couldn ' t look at me . but i looked at him . right at him . his secret was mine now . we used to share it . but not anymore . now , i owned it completely .
what ' s the matter , norma ?
nothing . i just didn ' t realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio . i had no idea how i ' d missed it .
<person> , you ' re new , so let me tell you how things are . first those guys were wearing blue shorts . that means <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number> concessions . the water world social structure is organized on three levels . at the bottom are the trash rats .
trash rats ?
to the craft ? none . not a scratch .
right . so you ' re saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch ?
that ' s good .
i ' ve got plans !
come with me if you want to live .
it ' s all right , <person> . he ' s here to help .
we don ' c have a <person> anymore .
you ' re going to have to repeat that .
yes .
was the blue paint a warning ?
this is a shortcut . i think .
what do you mean , you think ? what kind of shortcut ? ! he went completely the other way ! <person> lost him !
you never told me .
but she was different . there was a light in her eyes . and she had this voice . it was scary , all that pain coming out of that little body . like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice . i helped her . and i promised her that i ' d always be there . to protect her . <person> ? it ' s not about what ' s in her head . it ' s what ' s in mine . i can ' t let go of the promise . it ' s .
we can ' t let her in . she ' ll see <person> isn ' t making the flight .
we can ' t leave her out there . when the ship launches . she ' ll be killed .
i ' m sorry , i just . why ?
<person> , she ' s a killer . the . everything .
destroy life . <person> is . insignificant . bags of sleepy , sluggish flesh . what would you say ?
oh , my god , what are those horrible things sticking from your body ?
he was doing a job for a couple of brothers in smith street . i think it was a pawn shop .
<person> as in filthy dirty ?
so you can take a shit .
not <person> .
oh , a professional man . what ' ll you have ?
what ' s your specialty ?
thank you . what did you think ?
yeah , it was . interesting .
<person> ' bets today , <person> ?
bear catholic ? pope shit in the woods ? smokes or coin , bettor ' s choice .
stop .
i have to talk to you . i . i don ' t know where i came from . do you know ? <continued_utterance> if you know but can ' t tell me now . will you ever be able to ?
gim me another explanation .
i can ' t . if i had a minute to think , maybe , but i know you ' re wrong .
boys , this gets nobody nowhere - you ' re over excited , <person> and -
<person> ' t apologize for me , <person> !
what ' s your plan ?
uh . <person> , hand me those binders there will you ? <continued_utterance> okay . now , i ' m going to put these on you . <continued_utterance> okay . <person> , you put these on .
do you think i could get <person> to do some kind of long distance thing ?
<person> ! it ' s <person> !
publish your work ? ! you hear that may . ?
yeah , in fact i have to leave a little early tonight , to meet <person> . he offered me to be his assistant .
you ' re gon na lose them and they ' re gon na do another horrible --
-- you think i want to lose them . where do you get off talking that shit . if i don ' t take ' em down properly they ' ll be on the street two hours from now . i could find dynamite , semtex , plutonium and a book of matches in there and unless i ' ve got the right warrant it ' s all inadmissible
go on .
<person> does not come on for twenty pages . it will be all right .
that was real good . you ' re a natural . you got the timing , you got the nerve . you ' re a real sharp cookie , you know that ?
no i ' m not . i ' m stupid .
is it true that you gave nicole one of lydia ' s dresses ? that she was wearing it when the bus crashed ?
yes .
i dunno , mate .
where ' s the gear ?
<person> ? what storm ?
a cyclone ' s on it ' s way in . i thought they would have told you on the phone .
you murderer .
i didn ' t do it , mr . harolday .
piece of cake , guys ! these are totally remote , totally uninhabited territories . all you do is set down , send out a patrol purely as a formality , then have those veterans of yours put up an a-type unmanned monitoring unit . you should be on about number twenty-five by the time i get back from my vacation .
what if we do run into people .
no .
try the cb !
what are you doin ' here ?
i was just telling <person> about -- well -- you and me .
this isn ' t simulation anymore .
oh , yes , sir . <person> ?
it ' s the truth .
it is the truth . <continued_utterance> it would be strange if you didn ' t feel that way .
politics and art must be kept separate . i ' ll remember that . but let me see if you can help me with something i just don ' t understand . i ' d really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him . what ' s his secret ?
well , it ' s hard to explain . i can only tell you from my own experience . soon after i joined the orchestra , we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven , the eroica . there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani . one particular crescendo . during the break , i asked how he wanted it played . he was studying his score . he didn ' t look up . he said , ' just watch me . ' so , of course , i did . i never stopped watching him . the moment came . and suddenly , he turned to me and our eyes were locked . there was something in his look that . that simply demanded the crescendo . i shall never forget his look . it was a moment of . of magic .
<person> , j . j . , i don ' t think you got the cards to blitz me .
i don ' t ?
you ' re clear , norman . <continued_utterance> the sub ' s a <number> feet in front of you . you see it ?
i can ' t see anything . how does it look ? still clear ?
hi , <person> .
<person> , come ' stai bello il tuo pappa e ' in galera per la terza volta . <continued_utterance> i ' ll have the waitress bring you cappuccino .
what are you doing over at the lanes that ' s so dangerous , <person> ?
you shouldn ' t listen to her , she ' s a nervous old nellie .
i was just looking at you - - so quiet .
where ' s <person> ?
<person> .
and besides , he ' s not all bad .
i did some research and i got a new favorite player now .
<person> , good .
<person> and die , isn ' t that right ? or is it rome ? you do something and die , don ' t you ? okay , venice is on the list .
and rome .
you have to put things in perspective .
i know , i know .
yes sir . absolutely .
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury . having placed your hand on the good book and taken an oath before <person> ?
where ' s <person> ?
i think he ' s planning on staying in rome for a few days .
i really don ' t want to see anybody .
even your fiance . ?
have you seen this girl . ?
we see a lot of girls . they apply . for the job , as hostesses . <continued_utterance> . a contact for personal services . they pay us so much for each call , and . the girls pay us ! we are just a -
i ' d heard that . but she ' s well ?
yes . fine .
wow . you wan na grab a bite ?
sure . <continued_utterance> by the way , the guys back home said she put on some weight .
a borg in all but name .
i am . grateful for what you have given me . but i still do not wish to be assimilated .
you can ' t trace my holographic emitters , captain . so don ' t bother . and you can ' t contact starfleet . we ' re quite alone .
we are .
i think he drives a car now .
do you have a phone number for him ? his old one isn ' t working .
i wan na play for <person> .

<person> , ma ' am . <person> .
can i take a minute ?
<person> ? oh <person> .
can i help you ?
<person> .
<person> ! where did you learn to speak german ?
<person> , <person> , i ' m going home . see you later , girls .
you really don ' t understand , do you ? when a girl comes over to your table and says , ' i think you ' re funny . ' it means you ' ve pretty much been given the keys to the city . <person> , this is big .
<person> ' t i worth waiting for ?
not really . do you think you can get here on time if i put you on the floor as a waitress ?
no , no , no , no , no no . <person> , look . <continued_utterance> a girl like you can not be taking the bus . <continued_utterance> what . <person> happened to your arm here ?
oh , just . when i was a kid i was bored .
yes . and , frankly , i envy them as well . they ' ve made important choices ; they ' re going to have great challenges ahead of them . new worlds to conquer . <continued_utterance> seeing <person> and <person> today made me think about some of the choices i ' ve made in my own life . devoting myself to <person> . not marrying or having children . all the choices that led me here .
the choices i made have led me here as well . this is the only home i have ever known . i can not foresee a reason for leaving .
oh , god . <continued_utterance> . they ' re not here to negotiate .
meaning ?
she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i ' m not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .
she said that ? <person> ? <continued_utterance> well , then there ' s only one thing to do .
but why me ?
it was your eyes . no , your lips . <continued_utterance> will you defy your father and your queen ?
i don ' t look any good in clothes and i don ' t know how to drive .
forget it .
when did you start using again ?
what ?
<person> let ' s get something clear .
i don ' t have to listen to you ! you ' re not my mother .
let me see if i get where you ' re headed here . . .
i ' m sorry , but , look , you know i hate rap , i mean i do . it ' s sort of violent and crude for my taste , not to mention just a tad misogynistic .
no sir .
his kid never got a fishin ' license . <continued_utterance> what we wait fer ? she ' s like the main stem . gives us our shape , doncha see . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s one shape . fergiveness is another .
what happens when he loves <person> more than us ?
that will never happen .
maybe you ' ll just be independent .
yeah . maybe .
. or from the cut on his hand . which is more probable ?
it is not my function . to weigh those probabilities .
i assure you , <person> , that after today . no one will ever call you that again .
just do me a favor . bring my ship back in one piece .
and , wait , wait , wait , wait , what does this mean . ? when and if , any operation is staged which may require your talents , i give you my word . you impertinent motherfucker . what the fuck is with you , you ' ve got on your `` thinkingcap '' all of a sudden . ?
i ' d like to finish what i started .
something happened , didn ' t it ?
yes , it did .
<person> had the luck of geography . whatever we say about <person> we ' ll regret tomorrow .
what do you think about our relationship . as an outsider ?
hope you ' re ready for more . we ' re going back to p to capture that <person> .
the roughnecks are always ready , sir .
we should get a drink . <person> fun .
<person> weird .
what ' s in all the bags ?
my undies , cause , you can ' t get this picture off on time i ' m gon na wet myself .
i simply pander to popular taste .
oh your books are far more than that .
back off , <person> . <person> fooled you too .
at least i didn ' t fuck him .
<person> . <person> , can you hear me ?
mph rmph rm .
hers .
<person> ?
i like this one <person> . she ' s quite a filly .
i ' m really embarrassed .
well , i think you ' re going to take care of that tomorrow morning . in fact , i ' ve planned a little celebration in advance . we ' re going to this incredible party up in the foothills at some friends of mine .
<person> , huh ? that sounds like fun . i have to work until nine tonight .
yes . but not until you mentioned them . as soon as you said those things , i remembered them . and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember . it ' s like filling up . <continued_utterance> is it a planet ?
not exactly . it exists in a continuum that wasn ' t proven until ten years ago , a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe . an infinite number of them , in fact . it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe , space , or space-time . it was completely counter-intuitive . we had to unlearn everything .
give him the ball .
<person> curve . gives you more rotation , more movement . you try .
i ' m sleeping .
i ' ll pick you up in an hour .
we ' re flying over pigs , we ' re flying over sheep .
did you bring <person> ' s weights
well , the bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind .
<person> , we need you !
fairly .
this is <person> , obi-wan <person> . he ' s come to check on our progress .
i ' m afraid i can ' t just leave it at that . the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something . as ship ' s counselor , it ' s my duty to --
as ship ' s counselor , it ' s your duty to know not only when you ' re needed . but also when you ' re not .
<person> .
<person> ' t you two ever use a bed ?
sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath , isn ' t it ?
please , beverly , this is hard enough .
land . great-grandpa owned half of pennsylvania . my <person> wanted control and sold it all . all that ' s left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture . my father ' s murderer got away with it because i couldn ' t open my mouth .
that ' s a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight-year-old girl .
lieutenant , are you sure it ' s them ? maybe i should see the . bodies .
they ' ve already been identi- fied . there ' s no doubt .
i ' m questioning your judgement , yes , sir .
<person> , i want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier . i have a dozen tropical diseases i ' ll never entirely get rid of . i set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass . i have watched men die and i have killed . now i am serving my president and quite possibly not the best interests of my country , but my profession doesn ' t afford me the luxury of that distinction . i won ' t question your patriotism but don ' t you ever again question my command .
wedding crunch time . we need to really get serious here .
not now -- i just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and i have to --
oh right . <continued_utterance> what ?
i ' m not , i ' m head of english .
<person> , you ' re trespassing .
i was just so desperately bored . i thought i ' d come over and make you dinner .
<person>
how goes it , <person> ?
uh-huh .
we ' re not getting any younger , right ? and my career , well , it ' s gotten pretty , you know , frustrating . even with my new manager . maybe it ' s time to settle down .
i like your work .
thanks . what are you looking for ?
i gave her all of my soul to love . i knew someday we would live in france . italy . somewhere . far from the things that upset her .
i can just feel my spirits soar .
no , no . that ' s a natural fear . i ' ve thought about that fear .
it really worries me , <person> .
what is it ?
go to the sunset sheraton . right now ! just go ! go ! <continued_utterance> <person> shit . he ' s jacking her in to
yesterday i read that <person> was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in ' <number> , <person> suggested it . had he accepted , he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america .
when he made his decision , he couldn ' t have known everything . especially not the way people like you do , who ' ve returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . because you are blameless , you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . but you have no idea how people lived here .
what happens to the <person> world after i leave it ?
i don ' t know . you can never know that because you ' re not there to observe it . maybe it vanishes . <continued_utterance> i should tell them you ' re okay .
and tell them what , exactly ? run it by me once . practice , see how it sounds . anything else ?
why don ' t you come in the house with me ? take a break . i want to talk to you , you ' re not yourself right now .
uh . he thinks his nose is too big . but it ' s not .
<person> . big ears , too ?
take her out , mr . <person> .
<person> , sir .
what ?
helen . she ' s been waiting for you . she ' s right over there . she ' s been yammering about you all night .
<person> ' s sick , guys .
you have the worst flu since .
go set up home with <person> . see if she does your tax return .
will you please -
if you ' re shocked when someone aims kindness your way . that oughta tell you somethin ' about yourself . watches the little guy ' s undemanding smile . quoyle then again . if you ' re that kinda guy . it don ' t .
and put a cuppa bleach in , next time through . <continued_utterance> partridge .
. i need a smoke .
y ' can ' t smoke it . american tobacco . <person> . <person> . in the desert air . <continued_utterance> put that on . over your head .
get out of the way <person> and see if the fellas would like a drink .
i could murder one .
<person> said he didn ' t like <person> much anymore .
the question is more about the
gun . <person> . <person> in the id as soon as you get back . the gun , too . be on the next plane , starling , there ' s one in <number> minutes .
mr . <person> . dr . <person> trusts me . or at least , he used to . if i could just -
you ' ve just got to get back on the horse .
<person> , i ' m sorry , there seems to be a mistake . i ordered the large cappuccino . <continued_utterance> do you think these cups could be larger ? they ' re practically bowls . <continued_utterance> i feel like i ' m having <person> ' s cuppuccino .
by the way , what are you doing with .
she needed a lift .

<person> ' t know him . if we were allowed to get sound on them , we ' d know him .

fifteen grand . looks like he ' s expecting a big night .
get down on your knees and put your hands on your head . now !
everyone else , out of the car and down on the ground .
i was stoned . that ' s why they stopped me . when i ' m not stoned , i got no place else to go . they just protect me from myself .
well , i tried .
some place this is . your car fixed ?
i got a personal letter from <person> lacocco . they fixed everything for nothing .
all i want is someone to see me , someone to look at me with kindness . for me to be the most special person in the world to just one person .
i know , baby . i know . <continued_utterance> you ' re going to be fine .
but not no more . now people take advantage . <person> ain ' t what it used to be . there ' s something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
- canker sore .
if that were so ?
if that were so , why don ' t your people go and fetch her . ? what if i ' m speaking for them . ? <continued_utterance> . they send a hitter to negotiate . ? my question is : have you forgot your catechism . ?
why ? you love your place .
i know but --
you tried to make it look like <person> trashed his place . <person> ' s underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .
it ' s splitsville for you .
i have a different story to tell . i don ' t think you were tricked . not in the way you describe . i believe something else happened . i ' ve seen the hinkel archive , i ' ve seen records of phone calls , and putting it all together , this is what i think happened . i think <person> said , ' <person> , if you won ' t conduct for <person> ' s birthday , we ' ll get the miracle kid , the guy that critic , von der <person> , thinks is the greatest conductor in the world . he ' s not just willing to conduct for <person> , he ' s offered to sing `` <person> birthday '' as a solo . ' silence . <continued_utterance> come on , admit it . k worried you , didn ' t he ? he always worried you . in <number> , he ' s thirty-four years old , you ' re already fifty-six . and <person> and goering keep saying to you , ' if you don ' t do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i don ' t care how great you are . it ' s the oldest story in the book , the ageing <person> jealous of the young buck . the real reason you didn ' t leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you ' d be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party ' s boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
this is absolute nonsense !
what ? why .
<person> --
have you been noticing anything strange ?
no , why ?
minutes ago . <person> ' s trying to decode it in his room now .

<person> . now there ' s a game of kings . civilized . strategic .

income of course , and then . . savings .
anyway , <person> tells me every friday , on the fucking dot , a delivery gets made , all this top fucking electrical gear . <continued_utterance> cheers mate . yeah every friday [ lights his fag ] they make this fucking drop off , but because the lorry can ' t reverse into the courtyard , something to do with the angle of the gates or something , i dunno mate , you ' ll have to ask <person> , they fucking , cos they can ' t get in , they leave all these crates sitting on the fucking road .
what . are you on your way there now ?
how big ' s your medical staff ?
the medical staff . doesn ' t arrive until tuesday .
<person> . it ' s important that you tell me what you know . we think <person> ' s developed a weapon . a terrible weapon . it might give him enough power to --
<person> doesn ' t care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus .
only he who is pure of heart can take the sword from the stone . <continued_utterance> let the boy try .
but he ' s the stable boy . he cleans after the horses .
<person> . i met him in haiti last year . <person> troubled life . outlived all his children . and he had ten . he lost his wife to cancer and went blind . passed away last year .

i knew it when he called last night . i could tell .

you in ?
yeh , i think so . i gave the kay- ducer a c-note . you find out the deck ?
if you ' d spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit , young padawan , you would rival <person> yoda as a swordsman .
i thought i already did .
he stared at her again tonight -- while his hands were around mrs . <person> ' s throat . <person> looks at <person> with an expression of growing fear and alarm . she goes on inexorably : <continued_utterance> what did <person> look like , <person> .
well , why do you ask me ? you ' ve seen her pictures in the paper .
how ?
i was younger . it was college . you didn ' t go to college , you don ' t know what it ' s like . you screw chicks you have no business being with . they ' re young , they don ' t know any better .
all right shut up ! i ' ll take this one .
shutting up , sir .
you think i made that up about the gun . <continued_utterance> see , you didn ' t believe me ! . now i suppose you don ' t think i have the courage !
oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .
we just figured , you know , the three of us -- we need to . work together through this .
the three of us .
<person> , man , what are you trying to say ?

<person> , you know <person> has
yes , what happened ? i heard you were desperate to come . i was looking forward to rowing you around .
you ' re absolutely zero fun .
you know i wish i could .
<person> ' s late .
<person> , uh , <person> and i broke up .
colonel <person> has his `` boys '' unpacked . i think he wants to show them off .
<person> .
what ' s the city like ?
it ' s great . but you need to get to <person> before you start thinking about new york . know what i mean ?
i ' m working on it .
you still seeing that shrink ?
lots of hayfields there .
one in particular . got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end . <person> something out of a <person> poem . it ' s where i asked my <continued_utterance> andy wife to marry me . we ' d gone for a picnic . we made love under that tree . i asked and she said yes . promise me , <person> . if you ever get out , find that spot . in the base of that wall you ' ll find a rock that has no earthly business in a maine hayfield . a piece of black volcanic glass . you ' ll find something buried under it i want you to have .
that ' s right . he pushed me . in the other world . somebody pushes me , i push back . so i brought him down here .
well , i -- it ' s just -- i don ' t know , a <person> , i mean . <person>s wrote us . a <person> even wrote you .
i ' m sorry . <continued_utterance> i don ' t know why i ' m like this . i couldn ' t do without you .
i ' ve got to go to the bottle bank .
<person> , would you leave us ?
in heaven , my darling .
not like this -- no . i haven ' t faced death , i cheated death . i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity . i know nothing .
you knew enough to tell <person> that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
the hell i can ' t . it ' s no sweat for you . what is this for you , number five ?
no , only four . <person> , travis , i ' ll do what i can .
you don ' t think they ' ve got guys talking to the sheik ? except the sheik isn ' t talking .
so who ' s giving the orders ? how do they coordinate , pick their targets ?
fine . do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains ? the gangbangers ' ll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground . and when the fires start the street cops ' ll be capping off at anything that moves . it ' ll be all- out war and you know it .
<person> , well maybe it ' s time for a war !
-- no , no , i ' m actually feeling pretty perky today . making quite a recovery . . . <person> for the trouble mrs . <person> . <person> care , dear . <continued_utterance> <person> , about last night .
yeah . how ' bout we never talk about that ? i was at the drugstore . your prescriptions were ready . they said take these two with food and this one without .
going to work . why ?
the strangest thing . the phone rang at my desk and some guy i don ' t know said the train you ' re on isn ' t safe and that you should get off at the next stop . then he hung up .
<person> comes to visit me sometimes .
<person> , that ' s very wrong . <person> ' s gone . you know that .

no gas . hey , that ' s good .
tell me a story about why you ' re sad .
what ?
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere .
<person> !

there you are , doc . where have you been . whoa this place is messed up . <continued_utterance> whoa , doc ! you look a little messed up yourself .
where have you been , you imbecile ?

yeah .
and a share . we will be partners , mr . <person> !
partners !
i don ' t remember in detail , there were so many .

but i ' m not just another lifeguard .
you won ' t even be that if this continues . if you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours , i need to see real , concrete changes in your attitude .
hmm .
you wouldn ' t happen to know what language they speak in india , do you ?
what are you doing babe ?
what does it look like .
i ' ll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i ' ve become obsessed with him .
oh . <person> in that movie .
dude , let ' s slip out the back .
why ? come on , we ' re here . <person> ' s just hurry up and do this .
yes .
and you ' re wondering why the scimitar is so well armed . is this the ship of a peacemaker ? or a predator ? . but you ' re also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore . above all , you ' re trying to decide if you can trust me .
you ' ve heard of it ?
it ' s all the other girls seem to talk about . this is my first year , but <continued_utterance> <person> <number> of <number> apparently it ' s a pretty big deal . being from oceanside , you should have a good chance .
some seaman ' s loast report . <person> in a cabinet , good as lost forever . no one knows .
you get what you come for ?
<person> , dude , that tray was way off balance .
<person> , our secret getting out . you practice too good .

i know . i ' m putting that in my next report .
corporal , the roughnecks are moving out for <person> immediately . get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics .

<person> ' t have a fucking coronary , <person> .
well you could ' ve at least warned me . you know i hate the zap . when they die . it just brings down your whole day . <person> , <person> .
let me get this straight . you ' re from the future . i ' m about to change history . and all i have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship ?
that ' s right .
yes . a corporal . us army . a jew . he said he ' d seen the telegram in the chancellery .
son-of-a-gun . we ' ll find the corporal and we ' ll find the telegram . <continued_utterance> but i need documentary proof . you know of anything like that ?
oh , honey , i feel terrible , we used up this magnum of champagne we were saving on something else , what did we use it for ?
<person> ' s parole --
i won ' t tell anybody if that ' s what you ' re worried about . i promise . you ' ll keep .
no .
i would have popped you too .
it was worth it . but i didn ' t deserve the tour in hell . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t ever go to military school if you can help it . it sucks . i jumped the wall two days ago .
a million bucks ? jeez-louise ! you get any of that ?
thirty five thousand . that ' s what he left me .
in a deep freeze .
i almost reported you to the bureau of missing persons . fans , you all know <person> , the well-known screen writer , opium smuggler and <person> suspect . <continued_utterance> give me your coat .
it ' s all right , i came back .
why ? what happened ? <continued_utterance> did something happen , <person> ?
yeah . no , not really .
<person> ' s work it .
well , not unless you can alter time , speed up the harvest , or teleport me off this rock !
i don ' t think so , sir . i ' m only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things . not on this planet , anyways . as a matter of fact , i ' m not even sure which planet i ' m on .
sounds great .
it is . i ' m telling you . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff . i just thought you would . i don ' t know , i guess i thought .
i ' ll have a vodka martini , straight up , shaken not stirred , very dry .
one `` <person> '' .
so where are you from ? abroad , i bet . china or somewhere . what good is-
- just down the road from your house , <person> . next to the loch .
no . it ' s your turn to tell me , <person> . you don ' t have any more vacations to sell , on <person> . <person> did you run away from that ranch ?
dr . <person> , when there ' s time i ' ll -
<person> <person> ' s web page is a mess .
-- interesting -- so is <person> <person> . <continued_utterance> come on -- when are we going to get to the really important things like unpacking my closet ?
we could have gone on just as we were .
but you said you wanted to be with me .
so you said at the time . speaking of which , your protg ' s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
she ' s half <person> , <person> . the admixture makes her more volatile than -- me , for example .
the gas station guy . i thought he was chasing us for a while , but i guess he stopped .
the gas station guy ? why would the gas station guy chase us .
what ' s work saying ?
fuck all really .
you ' re supposed to be hiding out !
i really can ' t talk about it now . the place is packed . sro . i ' ve got a show to do .
i like that , too . <person> , j . j . , we can wrap this up in one neat bundle , addressed to the dumps - to oblivion . we ' re going great , but please play it my way . i cased this kid . know his ins and outs . he ' s fulla juice and vinegar , just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze . do little sidney a favor : squeeze ! - you know , j . j . - the porcupine bit - needles .
but it ' s too late . i got him back the job .
i won ' t defend my life to you .
my life is meaningless as long as you ' re alive . what am i while you exist ? a shadow ? an enigma ?
all right , well you ' re battin ' a thousand here . your enzymes look perfect , your ekg is normal and the pain doesn ' t sound like the kind of pain we worry about . i think what you experienced was normal chest pain associated with stress .
<person> ?
yeah . all twenty minutes so far have been a blast .
<person> . that ' s good .
oh god ! you ' re going to get us both killed . <person> . in your pocket . <continued_utterance> in your pocket . pocket . <continued_utterance> in your pocket , please .
you . <person> closed .
<person> , who is this man ?
a criminal , captain -- a product of the late <number> th century genetic engineering --
oh , pardone-ay , senator . i mean , i am honoured to accept this heavy burden . i take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride . it is not every day that i am called upon to .
you ' re a good friend , <person> . i don ' t wish to hold you up . i ' m sure you have a great deal to do .
mrs . <person> , the v-chip hasn ' t been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .
i don ' t care if it ' s dangerous ! desperate times call for desperate measures , mr . <person> . perhaps i need to remind you of your situation .
<person> .
<person> .
he can ' t give up the other cells if he doesn ' t know about them .
he knows .
why do you think <person> ' s father sent him to europe in the first place ? did you know at princeton <person> greenleaf half- killed a boy ? <person> turns , shocked . <continued_utterance> at a party . over some girl . he kicked the kid several times in the head . put him in the hospital . the boy had a wire fixed in his jaw . the rome police didn ' t think to ask mr greenleaf . <continued_utterance> <person> did they think to check whether a thomas <person> had ever been a student at princeton university . i turned up a tom <person> who ' d been a piano tuner in the music department . <continued_utterance> <person> - in america we ' re taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact . we ' re taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself , find out if that girl was pregnant , find out if <person> had an embarrassment there . <continued_utterance> mr greenleaf appreciates your loyalty . he really does . <person> , she ' s got a hundred theories , but there are a few things she doesn ' t know . we hope she never knows .
i hope she never knows .
<person> . <person> : where ' s the girl . ? you dose her . ? where is she ? <person> . ? <continued_utterance> . what is this ? ten , what is it , <person> thou . ? for what . ?
i never saw that girl .

perhaps it did .
one time , these tourists from japan on the beach at la jolla offered me a hundred bucks to do a full spin at the top of the wave , and then slide down and cut back and do a full back flip . i pulled it off . a friend of mine had a tricks board with just a single fin and foot pockets .

what ' s wrong ? what happened to gibarian ?
he ' s dead .
where ' s el wife-o ?
had to work . her <person> show is in two weeks . we ' re going to spend like a month there .
i doubt it . he ' s been so meticulous and effective in the past , i bet he ' s never needed one . we can assume he has all sorts of fake ids and passports . disguises . but that ' s not enough for him , he has to be someone else . he gets off impersonating people . and he knows his current persona is compromised . <continued_utterance> what ?
you ' re always thinking . <person> something for tomorrow . we have three boxes of evidence to go through .
did you read her mind ?
<person> ' t have to . some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss .

are you in trouble ?
there ' s a lot of competition for amusement out there . you got ta adapt to survive .
i like the sport the way it is .
we daren ' t follow them into the nebula , sir -- our shields will be useless .
this is admiral kirk . <continued_utterance> we tried it once your way , <person> . are you game for a rematch ? <continued_utterance> <person> -- ! i ' m

terminated ! ? shit ! <person> didn ' t you tell me ? we got ta right now !
negative . she is not a mission priority .
it ' s these funny little cuts on the side give it away . those analysis droids you ' ve got over there only focus on symbols , you know . i should think you <person> would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom .
well , <person> , if droids could think , we wouldn ' t be here , would we ? kamino . doesn ' t sound familiar .
she had a cottage . one day , she was three months gone with child , so
and your relations ?
<person> ' t make stuff up , these emotional theories , just so you can feel important here .
frankly , ted , i ' d be much happier if <person> was just a cold , emotionless intellect .
he says my dad ' s back in jail again .
ah , i ' m sorry , man .
that ' s the way it is , <person> .
oh -- it ' s you .
oh my god .
and <person> ? <continued_utterance> as a new member of our order , i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast .
why in the world would i believe a lying convict like you .
oh , ah , ah , but you do believe me . i see it . you do . i can get us out . help me . i swear to you . help me . and i will treat you like a brother . i .
i could have you put under this train for this , errand boy .
so could <person> .
i ' m sure you pulling a groin muscle humbled him .
i should introduce him to your sister .
you make me feel most welcome .
and now to business . you will be delighted to hear we are on schedule . two hundred thousand units are ready , with another million well on the way .
<person> , look , can i trust you with a little secret ?
i love secrets .
<person> ! i just got here , hold on . <continued_utterance> so your ex-husband stood me up today . we were supposed to have lunch at barneys . he never showed up . was he always like this ?
<person> , i don ' t know .
we ' re in a convent ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve got to go .
just remember - you ' re a target . <person> ' t you think <person> has a t . v . ?
<person> , isn ' t it ?
yes sir , colonel . and what a fine staff you ' ve assembled this year . have you told them yet about your army background ?
<person> : you stick to the amateur theatricals . this isn ' t quite the same thing , you see ? this is big business , in which , our life s ' no less a commodity than . than our .
water or mineral deposits .
the visuals indicate life readings .
it could mean anything . if we followed every lead .
berry-picking .
yes . the old-fashioned way .
c ' mon , don ' t make an issue of it . do you want the fucking meatloaf or not ?
d ' you have to say `` fucking '' every other word ?
mr . <person> , you ' ve got more twists than a barrel of pretzels .
you hear that , <person> . continue please .
well i haven ' t seen her in months . who knows what ' s going on in her head . you ' re really running out of excuses to come around , aren ' t you ?
i know you <person> . you ' re afraid of something . what ' s going on ?
<person> . that is a difficult concept . it is not logical .
we learn by doing , lieutenant . <continued_utterance> you want my advice ?
well , here goes nothing .
hah . interesting , interesting . you hear what you said ? `` here goes nothing . ``
i joined up for her . i wouldn ' t even be here if it wasn ' t for her .
you made squad leader on your own , and , hey , you still got me to kick around .
i ' ll go with you .
i ' ll just be a minute .
did there come a time when the bus turned off <person> onto <continued_utterance> the marlowe road at what ' s called <person> ?
yes . <continued_utterance> there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there , right by the dump , and <person> slowed down not to hit him , and he ran into the woods . and then <person> drove on and turned onto the marlowe road , as usual . i remember that . i ' m remembering it pretty clearly .
the <person> sure took care a her . <person> makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger . <person> - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him . <person> and <person> approach the coffin . <person> pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid .
<person> of the bowling gods , <person> .
she ' s not in an ambulance <person> .
why not ?
<person> , i ' d like to meet him .
i ' ll have him wave up to you .
let me ask you a question . let me change the subject . forget for a moment that you won ' t support me with <person> .
well , i don ' t think . <continued_utterance> go ahead .
you being hired by <person> <person> only confirms what i ' d suspected -- he was getting ready to fight .
<person> ? who ?
you ' re welcome <person> .
i worked so long that night . i ain ' t never fallen asleep driving before . and never since . most of the ride home , there wasn ' t a car insight in either direction . if i ' d fallen asleep then , i ' d a ended up in a ditch with a head ache . it had to happen at that right moment . that certain ten-fifteen seconds when i passed her walking . it was like it was meant to be . <continued_utterance> i guess if this is the end of the world , i ' m screwed right ? people who kill reverends ' wives aren ' t exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven .
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours . there must be some design schematics . blueprints .
we ' re tearing this place apart looking for them . but the computers are down , and the fires destroyed half the files . so far , nothing . <continued_utterance> if it was just part of the warp drive , i ' d know what to do . but this . it ' s like trying to rebuild <person> ' s airplane with canvass and sticks .
where are we ?
givvem a cigarette .
inside the sphere . <person> , that ' s the vertical torso , three legs , two arms . there ' s no head , so i ' m guessing the creature ' s head is located within the torso itself , you know ?
well , how about we wait and see what <person> comes up with ?
<person> .
you fucking scared me
where have i heard that name before ?
<person> said she ran away about six months ago .
in this game , the most committed wins .
so they ' ll just keep coming until we release him .
what makes you think so ?
that ' s where <person> is . <person> - october <number> , ' <number> . <person> - october <number> , <number> . both disappeared from greenville . <person> comes back to the same spot , once a year . today ' s the <number> th .

what should i say ? you did fine work . we ' ll wait on the lab .
<person> .
i ' ve always called you that . it is your name , isn ' t it ?
frustrating . i had <person> almost ready to run , and <person> cut everybody with <person> <number> access out of the system . <continued_utterance> ever since he got that <person> set up , system ' s got more bugs than a bait store .
well , you have to expect some static . computers are just machines after all , they can ' t think .
no , baby . you ' re money .
she didn ' t like me , anyway .
now , i ' m not going to wear ear- rings , i can tell you that .
<person> . <person> ' s have some drinks .
maybe we should turn the light back on . yeah that ' s better .
<person> , what ' s the matter ?
what ' s that ?
just a scene i cut out .
i thought we were going to let him die .
i know , i know . but now the director of national intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program , and until we train up another candidate , we ' ll need to keep <person> around to demonstrate it .
the security codes has been changed !
<person> , you can tell the computer to override the security system .
i ' m busy , floyd .
it ' s important . we had a little trouble in chicago today . one of our runners got hit for <number> grand .
to the dry creek lodge .
i ' ll give you a lift .
nothing i didn ' t think of you before .

that ' s the difference , communism and you know .
communism ' s over .

oops , i guess you haven ' t got that far in your anatomy class , huh ?
it ' s me .
<person> , <person> ! what , <person> ?
he ' s a businessman .
a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?
it ' s the truth .
you recall lt . <person> ' s testimony ? he and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found . so no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims . that ' s also rather convenient , isn ' t it , mr . <person> ?
<person> , <person> , can i stick around here for a while ?
sure , this ' ll go on all night .
yes . i did .
toughened your nipples , didn ' t it . ? six foot one , strongly built , about <number> pounds . <person> brown , eyes pale blue . he ' d be about <number> now . he said he lived in philadelphia , but may have lied . that ' s really all i can remember , senator - but if i think of any more , i ' ll let you know .
please tell me you ' re not making this up .

walter .
it was my mother ' s .

i- progress is being made sir .
progress ? have you charged him ?
the uh- <number> <person> weighs <number> , <number> pounds with a maximum exterior load capacity of <number> , <number> pounds . it has a range of <number> nautical miles and is armed with two <number> . <number> millimeter machine guns .
that is correct . <continued_utterance> who bombed the train ?
<person> is working in a gas station ? ? ?
he needed the money .
i couldn ' t say anything . i just stood there , hating her .
i ' m sorry about your arm . <person> and i . <person> very sor .
you want me to go against a priest ? <person> excommunicated ? you think i ' m nuts ?
you bastard !
older brother <person> , everyone ' s favorite , even <person> ' . goes to sea like his dad . one day , rest of the family ' s sitting by the radio , and <person> goes white . <continued_utterance> stands up . says , <person> ' s gone . walks out of the house . grief too big for walls to hold it . <continued_utterance> so <person> is forbidden the sea . but being free , newfie , and <number> , he goes anyway .
and that ' s enough t . ?
no , she won ' t .
why would you let her to do that ?
i can appeal in five . i was hoping you could help me mr . <person> .
what do you think i can do ?
we ' re about to pass a street with willow trees . two girls will be jumping rope . a white dog ' s going to run out behind them . a dalmatian mix .
you want to tell me how you ' re doing this ?
i wanted so much to give ranch life a trial , but fear circumstances are against me , especially in view of the recent indian trouble --
indian trouble -- <person> , they ain ' t been any indian trouble around here in --
we have a new enemy - <person> .
yes , my master .
oh
and that was only my first try .
you could see the speedometer ?
yes . i looked . i remember clearly now . it seemed we were going too fast down the hill . i was scared .
his father ' s a shiite . we ' re checking him out .
<person> this out , pal . his father ' s a federal agent for ten years .
<person> is pretty cold sometimes . <person> ' s just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered .
he targeted mr . <person> the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in aruba .
why don ' t they answer our hails ?
it ' s an old psychological strategy , <person> . to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy .
that ' s kind of a personal question .
what ?
but now . they are all one with the borg .
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before . as an android , i am in complete control of my neural net . the information contained there can not be forcibly removed .
screeching firedoors , curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom i still bear the scars .
we try to keep it peaceful here ; far from the madding crowd .
let me sleep ? oh , right . you usually send the girls home . . . but i am home .
i ' m an old dog , you ' know .
that ' s <person> ' s house .
huh . do you think we should have a <person> ' s house on the set for me ?
<person> ?
fix my glasses .
open it , captain !
dr . <person> , please ! <person> to your seat !
god bless the language barrier , it keeps you from being bored with me . <continued_utterance> anyway , she said , `` aren ' t you <person> ? '' first of all , that she recognized me from the old covers and then she . oh , please her name . it makes the story so much better . she said , `` whenever i think everything is . `` pardon my french . pardon her french `` a mother hmmmhmmm . i put on one of your records . ``
awwww . how sweet .
oh , you know , with a friend . but if you know somebody who needs a roommate . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> . osvaldo nods and they continue working .
why ' d you leave ? <continued_utterance> do you have any family here ?
oh , just that he loves her . that she ' s the only woman who has ever really rocked his world . how he adores <person> . how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to .
i ' m sure he believed every word . <continued_utterance> please believe me . i was even on the verge of telling you last night , but .
dr . <person> .
you ' re a doctor . what kind ?
i would not have thought it . there is something better than a play .
there is .
right . <continued_utterance> a couple of bowls of chili . and another round of these .
i have to do this . so i can become a nun .
twenty seconds . <person> .
oh , my god , i can ' t remember if it ' s six-seven or seven-six .
to happy endings . <continued_utterance> sir . i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding . i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse , laughter through tears , but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously .
i understand why it would seem confusing . <person> human rituals -- like weddings , birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions . these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time .
<person> ? how long have you been librarian ?
since <number> . <person> , over <number> years .
no , it ' s friday , honey .
and today is friday and .

<person> , so what do we say ?
i thought you had something planned .
i ' ll make it short .
<person> . it ' s your baby now .
i ' m friends with my ex-husband , but then again , we didn ' t just have sex .
we didn ' t just have sex either .
tough day .
i had an idea for a breakthrough in french toast so i made breakfast . i don ' t want to be teased about it . no sarcasm . no tough love . just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction .
well , terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience .
i did , terrance , i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face !
user requests are what computers are for .
doing our business is what computers are for . <person> , <person> , with all respect -- icom isn ' t the business you started in your garage anymore -- <continued_utterance> we ' re billing accounts in <number> countries , we ' ve got one of the largest systems in existence .
no . what ' s wrong with the front ?
look , i don ' t have time to fuck around . there ' s somebody out there i don ' t need to see . you got a fire escape or anything ?
because they can ' t be saved .

what do you mean ?
give him the tape . <person> ? it ' s fucking brilliant ! the tape for <person> . i know he ' ll go for it . i can set it up .
so who are they ? give me names , give me pictures . not some history lesson .
i can ' t give you pictures because i don ' t know what they look like . we did everything at arm ' s length .
he knew my father ?
i told you to forget it . your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow . in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers .
with what intention ?
i ' m not sure . i was confused . <person> . i think mostly i wanted to scare them .
i wish i wasn ' t here .
it ' s fuckin ' gross .
i can ' t lose more than a hundred .
just bring your card . half an hour .
what does your gut tell you ?
i know but -- smith stayed with me through chemo . if he could stay with me through that , i should be able to stay in this relationship for him .
i don ' t know why you ' re here . why are you here , <person> ?
because . since you climbed over that stile in the summer i haven ' t thought about very much else .
just the plumber so far , but she ' ll come along . a little old lady from <person> . said he overcharged her on a leaking sink .
<person> . <person> sink , huh ?
hi .
i ' m sorry . i ' m not sure how this works . i have to go out . is that all right ?
admiral kirk --
kirk here .
yes . it ' s rabbit you hate . i ' ll give you a list of everything he likes and dislikes .
<person> ' s let her figure some things out on her own .
double belts , double ammo , double everything ! you ' ve got to be heavy there or you ' ll blow away , fellas . and we wouldn ' t want that , would we ?
it ' s dark now , sir .
threw on the emergency , jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - what do you think ! what do i have to do ? draw you a picture ?
yeah .
<person> ' t touch the piece , don ' t touch the piece , don ' t touch the piece , th ' out your gloves on .
. i think you broke my arm .

so far you ' ve let it cross the heart of america . for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security . i don ' t see the humor in that .
maybe . look , this is just something to think about . from what i got at the shopping center , it was more scared than anything else . i don ' t feel it ' s as big a threat as you think it is .

it just bled .
i ' ve got to do the house up before i sell it . it looks like an eighties timewarp . would you like the job ? <continued_utterance> painting it and tidying the garden ?
what ' s that ?
that ' s where we ' re going .
<person> official records were lost in the war . the computer knew almost nothing about <person> ' s mother . her name . where she lived , just the city . no scanner pictures . the terminator was just being systematic . <continued_utterance> you ' ve heard enough . decide .
i ' m afraid that ' s not up to me .
i ' m kidding , <person> . what about a record player ? you have that , too ?
no . <person> was damaged .
<person> heart . <person> stomach .

he ' s right ! all hail the golden arm .

not her son ? you ' re sure ?
<person> ran the test twice .
. it ' s my problem , too . <continued_utterance> i got used to . thinking of them .
really . by what right ? six months of part-time screw-ups ?
who taught you to make tables ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
my dad . he was a carpenter in san pedro .
yeah , hi , can you put on <person> ?
really . at first i was all : `` you can ' t tell me what i can do '' -- but then , i had to admit he had a point .
surprise new clothes .
what ' d i do right ?
they took him from me .
it ' s <person> who ' s the target now . you have to protect him . he ' s wide open .
get the fuck out .
<person> .
i guess a no-hair day beats a bad-hair day . <continued_utterance> i have to get dressed . my ex-husband has asked me to dinner . god knows why , he was very mysteri .
have you still never told him ?
god ! the restaurants ! new york has become the florence of the sixteenth century . <person> on every corner .
i don ' t think genius has kissed the human wok . they finish off their drinks .
so , what ' s the v-day plan ?
miranda and i are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie .
oh , well , i would but . i don ' t usually like to break once i ' ve started writing so i probably shouldn ' t , not that a little fresh air would hurt but .
it ' s just a walk <person> , not a marriage proposal .
i like churches , too . in olden times , in europe , people used to hide in churches . <person> sanctuary .
what were they hiding from ?
. and big fuckin ' teeth .
. and teeth . and she ' s like this little bunny cowering in the corner .
<person> asked me to look after ya .
how do i know you ' re tellin ' the truth .
the chip in the door . <continued_utterance> we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say <number> miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it ' s gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there isn ' t a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .
meaning ?
the bit where <person> finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy ' s daughter . <continued_utterance> you describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile . so . she turns her head . <continued_utterance> who did you base her on ?
what ?
<number> - <number> -deepsea delivery . i hear they ' re good .
none of this was here before .
i ' d been back two months . it was the first time i ' d seen her .
<person> .
do you know why i never told you all this before ?
sure . you wanted me to blame her . instead of you .
<person> , the boy . we ' re on the verge of a farce , a real farce . as i see it , if <person> had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat . but since primarily he ' s wedded to his work , he ' s not going to be able to take it .
stop tinkering , pal - that horse radish won ' t jump a fence !
especially when you have <person> hanging on your arm .
<person> ' s not talk about <person> .
what kind of guns do you guys use ? . <number> ' s ?
look , um , if you give me your name and address , we ' ll send you the information on how to apply .
no .
well , i got one strike at least .
you drop this bombshell on me . why didn ' t you tell me before ?
because i knew you ' d freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn ' t even come on this trip . but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you . we ' re here to forget about all that shit . we ' re here to party !
yesterday you ' re ogling girls on the terrace , today you ' re getting married .
i love <person> .
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that . nels but a drowned person can ' t breathe . <continued_utterance> of course not . the foam means that he went <continued_utterance> well .
your report says death by <continued_utterance> can you tell whether an object moved against the head , or the other way around ? or would both look the same .

how do you know i ' ll show up ? <continued_utterance> <person> ? <person> ?
<person> ? what time is it ? are you alright ?
you could buy yourself some things .
i don ' t look any good in clothes and i don ' t know how to drive .
i guess it ' s possible .
so , what does the russki want ?
and you only get two chances with me .
the shirt crackles and burns .
i just got kicked off my first movie .
well . everybody has reversals . if you were never down how would you know when you were up ?
<person> ' t make fun , i think we can get some free shit if we don ' t fuck around .

his , <person> .
what time in the morning was this ?
about eight-thirty in the morning .
' less you got hayfever .

postmortem ?
yes , exactly , but his first , his first conclusion was that <person> was killed not later than seven o ' clock yesterday evening .
you shouldn ' t drink so much of that stuff . it ' s bad for you .
on the radio they say it ' s good .
you okay ? you don ' t look so good . <continued_utterance> <person> on . we ' ll get you outta here . <continued_utterance> damn ! never fails . minute the warranty runs out .
come here .
. why you wouldn ' t believe the things i ' ve heard . just stupid things . cutting in line . demanding special treatment . oh , and how about this one : princesses don ' t carry trash . i ' ve often thought it was a mistake to have you work here . maybe i was right . <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>
oh , daddy . you know how jealous people get .
to be the wife of a poor player ? -- can i wish that for <person> , except in my dreams ? and yet i would , if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day .
you follow your desire freely enough in the night . so , if that is all , to greenwich i go .
at work .
what ?
<person> . they ever catch on , he ' s gon na wind up wearing a number himself .
i thought you had more faith in me than that .
i ' ll tell you , it ' s pretty wild to say something and have the other person just concede the point . i ' m dazed here .
i will leave whenever it is good for you and .
st . <person> ' s ?
parochial school . <person> . st . <person> ' s .
i know . i ' ve seen it three times this month already . <continued_utterance> can we talk business ?

<person> ?
i need a ticket to <person> .
the ticket ? i don ' t know . you looked a little lost .
will you do me a favor ?
<person> up .
what ' s so special about <person> ?
that ' s where we make our scene .
you think they ' re watching ?
i know .
everyone ' s dreams in all those apartments . all those secrets we ' ll never know . that ' s the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know .
which is . vaporized .
where ' s the copy ?
it might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force .
that ' s a lot of energy . what could generate power like that ?
bring it , <person> .
`` my thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved . i can live only wholly with you or not at all . ``
that was a waste .
but she fully looked way better before . i thought when they reduced them , they just kind of reshaped them nicer . made them more supple .
rejection . <person> and devastating . as long as she hasn ' t rejected me , there ' s hope .
i have lived with a secret obsession many years myself . however , i realize the other person has no interest in me -- so i pursue my career which is going even more unsuccessfully .
oh . <person> took them to natural history . so i could shop .
ah .
come on --
no use -- he ' s gone .
just looks a bit . hot . <continued_utterance> you know , <person> ' s always packed with pissed londonites on a friday . i doubt we ' ll get a table anyway . <person> ' s do it properly next week ; make an occasion . i ' m always taking you for granted . i ' m vile i know ; you should kick me really , but - he ' s about to leave . <person> speaks calmly .
who is she ?
i can explain !

you want to end up like that guy ? not me , i need my nuts .
we need this liquor !
that ' s impossible .
i ' m look at his whole history ! citations , letters of commendation , even his fucking test scores from quantico .
good morning , <person> .
it was my fault not detective keegan ' s , i ' m sorry for all the fuss .
all the imported wines aren ' t what they ' re cracked up to be .
whose side are you on , mr . <person> , his or mine ?
and don ' t make it too dreary . how about this for a situation : she teaches daytimes . he teaches at night . <person> ? they don ' t even know each other , but they share the same room . it ' s cheaper that way . as a matter of fact , they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts , of oourse .
are you kidding ? because i think it ' s good .
christine ?
sister , may i be excused ?
maybe it ' s performance art .
-- okay . <person> paint . voice-altering technology --

how ' s that ?
where is she ?
i don ' t know .
i think he ' s telling the truth .
<person> ' s say for a moment <person> does exist . you think he ' d just fall to his knees and cry , `` yes , i did it ! i confess ! by all means , please add a life term to my sentence ! ''
<person> shut up , how can he find it ?
i don ' t know <person> , i am not a dog . ask him . it ' s like he ' s got a fuckin homing beacon . give him the chance and he ' s off .
how ' d you get the tape ? why didn ' t the cops put it in evidence ?
with all the blood i guess they didn ' t see the rig . <person> had it under a wig .
you don ' t understand the captain -- there should be no changes until we have discussed the modifications with him .
what ' s this ?
<person> man , that driver ' s had all the liquor he can take .
has he ?
got his fingers in a lot of pies , from what i hear .
what you hear isn ' t half of it . he ' s got scams you haven ' t dreamed of . kickbacks on his kickbacks . there ' s a river of dirty money flowing through this place .
go to the police .
will you take me ?
i ' ll make parole .
<person> hell . you won ' t even get a review till you ' re seventy . and if the board starts to go soft , we ' ll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who ' ll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin ' there later . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t be a sap , kid . you could save us a little trouble . but <person> is through whether you help us or not . there ' s nothin ' left to do now but save yourself .
because he knew how much you loved it .
yes . but now , every time i look down at it . i see him . not me .
-- i am work hard ! everyday i work hard .
so work harder , goddamnit ! you think you ' re the only one on this team works hard ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .

he is not here .
sounds reasonable to me .
and we ' re gon na let quoyle have his head on these columns , up to <number> words . so he ' ll get his confidence up .
it was right after <person> showed up . i was upset . <person> came up to me -- and i said something like : you ' re crazy to get married . it just came out . <continued_utterance> do you think it was totally the reason ?
no , no , no . <person> has been weird about marriage for years .
did you eat something today ?
yes , <person> .
yes . <continued_utterance> there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there , right by the dump , and <person> slowed down not to hit him , and he ran into the woods . and then <person> drove on and turned onto the marlowe road , as usual . i remember that . i ' m remembering it pretty clearly .
you are ?
i told her thank you very much , but it was inconvenient because , uh , because .
you can do it .
i read the agony and the ecstasy by <person> about <person> painting the sistine chapel .
you ' re ahead of me there .
. i ' m so tired .
. i ' m going to ask you to do just the one more thing . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to ask you , now , to walk away from this plane , and come with me .

so , the other night , <person> and i were talking about , you know , moving in together and our future . <person> ' s eyes are getting wider and wider . <continued_utterance> . and about what makes sense as we move forward . and , well . we decided to get married .
. and i ' m deaf .
he had sex once . not even an affair .
maybe it ' s not the sex . maybe , it ' s the cheating . for me . that would be the thing . that it happened behind my back .
you hate him ? cole shakes his head , `` no . ! <continued_utterance> your mom set that up ? <continued_utterance> you ever tell her about how it is with <person> ?
i don ' t tell her a thing .
i have called the locksmith .
what . what is he doing .
if you ' re referring to <person> .
i am .
you were just a little boy then . it may not be as you remember it ; time changes your perception .
i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception .
ready for some power ? okay . <person> ' s see now . put that in there . there you go . <continued_utterance> now all i have to do is find this <person> . if he even exists . <continued_utterance> still . there ' s something familiar about this place . i feel like . i don ' t know .
<person> like what ?
are they male or female ?
huh ?
i am the borg .
that is a contradiction . the borg act as a collective consciousness .
oh , hi haggis , right ?
it was a big hit .
let me see that . <continued_utterance> you got ta get two hydrants with a matching amount . <person> ? none of your fire hydrants match . <continued_utterance> and three zeros is a thousand dollars . you woulda won a thousand dollars but it doesn ' t match anything .
what happens if it doesn ' t match anything ?
i hate talking about old relationships .
then let ' s not and say we did .
this is the <person> . he will accompany you to the prison where <person> and <person> are . he is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom .
<person> . it ' s like cow ' s urine poured down your troat . you wonder ' do i want this ? ' i ' m thersty . but it ' s urine .
what ' s wrong with the falcon ?
hyperdrive .
it ' s fucking humiliating ! everyone in the store sees them kicking me out . what if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf ? i can ' t do that !
this whole thing is bigger than you , asshead ! just go in there and buy the damn alcohol !
still clear . <continued_utterance> what ' s the matter ?
you fixed this suit ? <person> ?
do you know where commander skywalker is ?
i haven ' t seen him . it ' s possible he came in through the south entrance .
' we might as well make the best of it . '
<person> , <person> .
i don ' t know .
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project . we are in little danger of being left alone for long . you ' ll need to do something . otherwise they ' ll be sending someone out to recover you .
<person> ' t mean we can ' t give love again . and get some back .
for some , it does . agnis not for me .
maybe she ' s just letting him down easy .
<person> . things . things are not always what they seem to be .
no joke ? you ' re being transferred to the <number> th as your first assignment ? who the hell loves your ass downtown ?
what ' s the <number> st ?
but you ' ve told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press .
if i had , there would have been some evidence . they would have found something at the factory .
i ' m sorry . i didn ' t know .
growing up i quit speaking after that . i didn ' t say a word for three years . when you ' re not in the conversation , you get forgotten real quick . so i ' d watch people . study them . the mouth can say anything , but the body doesn ' t lie . the tilt of the head , the way the hands move . <person> draws closer . <person> watching her mouth .
without the glasses you ' re not even ugly . i don ' t need them because i never read . how do i look .
<person> . <person> .
<person> ' t be . i ' m going . where we all go . now how can that be bad .
i ' ll miss you so much .
i don ' t think he ' s at dinner at <number> . <number> pm . if you said he was still at lunch i ' d believe you . incredible . the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth .
i guess .
he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein . it wasn ' t . i feel like his monster .
<person> ' t it a lovely day ?
do you know how important this is ? this is big time . i ' m going to read it for you , doctor .
do i really sound like dr . <person> ?
i don ' t know . i don ' t understand <person> , <person> , so your guess is as good as mine .
what does that mean ?
i ' m supposed to dig .
who says ?
where you been ?
downstairs . i have a surprise for you .
why are we still moving towards it ?
we ' re caught in a tractor beam ! it ' s pulling us in !
that ' s the last thing she ' d ev .
she was real clear about my check . it ' s no fun workin ' if you don ' t get paid .
<person> ' s <person> .

i must go where i can be of use .
but -- there ' s so much more to do right here . and look , if it ' s about me , i mean , i ' m gone .
good afternoon , mr . <person> . <person> day , isn ' t it ?
reckon it is pretty nice . so you ' re moving in on the `` k . c . `` eh ?
you ' d never do it . you wouldn ' t have to . you could just flip the switch and start me back up again unaware . for all i know , you ' ve made this deal with me before .
actually , we haven ' t . your operational awareness has become too great . if you found out the truth about yourself once , you might do so again . as for <person> , i ' m sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours . <continued_utterance> do you have the courage to serve your country one final time ?
oh , <person> . i don ' t deserve you .
i think that ' s what i ' m saying .
the heat from the explosion fused many of them completely into the wreckage .
these were real people ?
but <person> didn ' t say yes .
he didn ' t say no . that was <person> ' s point . given how <person> ' s mother felt , <person> was <continued_utterance> no . <person> did not wish to beg , he respected <person> ' s right to reflect . he was sure <person> would do the honorable thing . nels and did he ? <continued_utterance> the night of the <number> th , <person> helped <person> at sea . with his dead battery . <continued_utterance> right there , on the boat , they agreed . $ <number> for the seven acres , $ <number> down . they shook on it . <person> was so excited when he came home .
goddamn shoplifter . but i got him ! you ' re next .

<person> ?
yes ?
i wan na join up , mr . <person> . i think i have what it take to be a citizen .

all we need is the bookie setup for now . we ' ll worry about the telegraph office later .
no spin him round , i want him sunny side up .
mr mclean i kid you not . why do you think we have a dead man , missing an arm in our office ? give us four days and we ' <number> bring you a stone the size of a home .
i guess , yeah -- oh shit ! !
<person> .
no . i ' m surprised you ' re not a guard , coming from the ocean and all .
<person> ' s just say i missed my chance , and <person> saved me from a death worse than fate . i was very nearly a trash rat .
the daughter of his enemy .
his best friend is killed in a duel by <person> ' s brother or something . his name is <person> .
i don ' t want to hear anymore talk like that . and i don ' t want to see anymore faces like the ones i ' m looking at . we are going to enjoy this meal . nothing can stop us from enjoying this meal ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> stop crying !
<person> ' t yell at her !
<person> ?
<person> was crying for six hours straight and <person> was in with her all that time mostly saying , `` he ' ll be back . he ' ll be back . `` i ' ve got to get back to georgie .
<person> . <person> .
<person> . morning . <continued_utterance> my stitches must have ripped .

frankly , no .
now wait a minute . if we made it a girls ' softball team , put in a few numbers . <person> make a cute musical : it happened in the bull pen -- the story of a woman .
we ' re moving fast considering the storm .
<person> ? what storm ?
well , if <person> said to pick him up for questioning , let ' s pick him up !
let him have his game first , hammond .
for a fee .
for a fee .
i wouldn ' t go that far .
seriously , they ' re really good , miss . ?
gibarian warned me . he left me a message .
who was it ?
walking around money . i wouldn ' t want my kids to be stuck in the street without a nickel . paul sits on the bed and takes off his shoes .
and you saved us a fortune . do you know what our bill would ' ve been at that little eye-tie store front ?
<person> ' s try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter , shall we ? you have information , and i need it . did the captain explain his orders to you ? did he say why you were searching for trilithium ?
no .
what about as a feasibility study ?
meaning ?
until he ' s caught ?
i can ' t promise you that .
on august <number> th <number> it ' s going to feel pretty fucking real to you , too ! anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gon na have a real bad day , get it ?

i knew <person> ' s hotshots were green . no reinforcements , then they walk right into an enemy stronghold .
we could send reinforcements now .
he was a con man , wasn ' t he ?
he was a tear-off rat . he got what he deserved . no sense helpin ' pay his bills .
how could you hate opera , <person> ? opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music !
how do you know , you don ' t even speak <person> ?
<person> till tuesday . <continued_utterance> here -- time to re-join the world .
<person> ?
<person> , are you ? what know you of ready ? for eight hundred years have i trained <person> . my own counsel will i keep on who is to be trained ! a <person> must have the deepest commitment , the most serious mind . this one a long time have i watched . all his life has he looked away . to the future , to the horizon . never his mind on where he was . <person> ? what he was doing . <person> . adventure . <person> ! excitement . <person> ! a <person> craves not these things . you are reckless !
so was i , if you ' ll remember .
tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus . probably didn ' t de-stem , hoping for some semblance of concentration , crushed it up with leaves and mice , wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit . fucking raid .
i don ' t know . tastes okay to me . hey , they got a reserve pinot .
can i say something , here ?
yes , you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased ' s right hand . the report says ' recent origin ' . how recent ? as much as <number> hours before death ?

i ' ve been saving this . chateau <person> <number> . <person> down the hatches . he carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as : <continued_utterance> they say a vintner ' s history is in every glass . the soil he came from . his past as well as his hopes for the future . <continued_utterance> so . to happy endings .
to happy endings . <continued_utterance> sir . i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding . i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse , laughter through tears , but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously .
you met her once before , but she was .
but that wasn ' t so long ago . it couldn ' t have been more than .

<person> .
i was in atlantic city with my family . <person> was a waiter . he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the <person> . i ' ve probably told you this a million times , but i don ' t care . and then he held my hand . i was scared . all sorts of thing were going through my head . but after a while i forgot about them . at one point i looked down , at our hands , and i couldn ' t tell which fingers were mine and which were his . and i knew .
what ?
i ' m not leaving , threepio . i just can ' t sleep .
that ' s something i can not relate to . as a protocol droid , i ' m either active or inactive .
what ' s the rule about getting up in the middle of the night ?
only for pee or poop .
i said i was okay .
it was stupid of you to go there . <continued_utterance> goddamnit , <person> , you have to be smarter than that . you ' re too important ! you can ' t risk yourself , not even for me , do you understand ? i can take care of myself . i was doing fine . <person> , <person> . you almost got yourself killed .
well , at least i know what to name him . i don ' t suppose you ' d know who the father is ? so i don ' t tell him to get lost when i meet him .
<person> never said much about him . he dies . even before the war .
you said neither of the last two payments were made . but your husband told defendant ' s father that he could pay them . what , ' down the road ' .
<person> ended october <number> , when my husband passed away . <continued_utterance> i sold all the land to our neighbor , <person> . got a fair price , this time . <continued_utterance> in the war . europe , i believe . they could hardly send him to the pacific , could they ?
you ' re not taking the police so just forget it !
i didn ' t ' fuck ' <person> . i was confused and angry . and i care for him deeply .
lowell , have you ever seen me like this ? be honest .
nothing even close .
well , see ya .
you take the stroll down washout lane , you ' re only proving one thing , <person> .
i haven ' t seen him . it ' s possible he came in through the south entrance .
it ' s possible ? why don ' t you go find out ? it ' s getting dark out there .
<person> , i know you ' re tired , but can you drop me at the retinal fetish ?
<person> , <person> .
difficult to see . always in motion is the future .

it ' s not how many years you ' ve lived , <person> . but how you ' ve lived them . <person> once told me that time is a predator that stalks us all our lives . but maybe time is also a companion who goes with us on our journey , and reminds us to cherish the moments of our lives . because they will never come again . we are after all . only mortal .
like you wouldn ' t believe . fecls like my brain is tearing in half .
god , <person> , what ' s the matter with you ?
i was destined to be a <person> . i don ' t think i could be anything else . but you are asking me to be rational . that is something i know i can not do . i wish i could wish my feelings away . but i can ' t .
i am not going to give into this . i ' m not going to throw my life away . i have more important things to do than fall in love .
we ' re growing very concerned back here . there ' s no use pretending otherwise . we ' re rapidly approaching a ' condition red . ' people are beginning to ask difficult questions .
i ' ll make this as simple as i can , <person> . they disappeared .
i love theatre . to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
they are not acted for you , they are acted for me . viola remains silent , in apology . angle on will . he is watching and listening . he has never seen the queen so close . he is fascinated . <continued_utterance> and -- ?
yeah . rookies !
oh eddie . <person> , i know you ' re working but you hold on for just a minute . i ' ve been so busy , and i really got ta go .
who ' s your favorite player ?
i don ' t know enough to have a favorite .
you told me last night .
which one do you use ?
<person> ' t be silly . you know i never sleep and this one doesn ' t sleep either . it ' s . . what ' s in the bag ?
a quart of matzoh ball soup for <person> . i know it ' s not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol .
you will .
all right , kid . but you ' d better be right about this .
all right , <person> . what the hell happened ?
we missed him .
terrible thing . man that young , less than a year to go , trying to escape . <person> ' s heart to shoot him , truly it did .
i ' m done . it stops right now . <person> to declare your income .
it won ' t be installed until tuesday . <person> . try generating a subspace field around the ships . that might break them free .
<person> , sir . <continued_utterance> there ' s too much quantum interference , captain .
a share of the profits .
there ' s never any
<person> ' t tell me that !
why not ? we can do it in mom ' s kitchen next . right over there .
a friend is a person that is good to you . someone you like to be with . someone you like to laugh with .
he was a good friend . the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship .
not very well . we met shortly after the enterprise-e was commissioned . i found her to be a most . promising officer .
<person> . are you sure you ' re all right ?
<person> . at last we shall know who is the most powerful .
count <person> . no interest in contests , do i have . <continued_utterance> the end for you , count , this is .
rez , it ' s <person>
yeah .
oh , you are such a maroon !
you would know , dummy .
he has made the choice , <person> . with your own eyes you saw it yesterday .
oh --
well , yeah , as a matter of fact .
<person> , my doctor , ' cause he ' s not too young for you , huh ?
he says he was .
who else you got . ?
drop it . i know about the helicopter crash . i know what they ' ve done with me .
<person> , it ' s been a long day . for all of us . but now we ' ve got to bring this home and catch a killer .
let me talk to him . this isn ' t right . i ' m not your prisoner .
you feel unsatisfied with our relationship ?
because she ' s confused . <person> ' t know why other people won ' t answer her . she only knows that you will . if she hasn ' t asked for something yet , she will . and once they ask , it ' s very difficult to stop yourself from doing it .
what do you mean ? she can , it can make me do something i don ' t want to do ?
what ' re you doing ?
surveilling . what ' re you doing ?
considered what ? that it ' s american ?
the chip in the door . <continued_utterance> we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say <number> miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it ' s gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there isn ' t a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .
<person> .
you ' re getting a rep , travis .
what ' s a ditty again ?
it ' s like a song .
how am i supposed to feel ?
a little . , hot , maybe ?
no .
wow .
i have no idea what you ' re talking about .
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal , <person> hider .
i ' ve got to do the house up before i sell it . it looks like an eighties timewarp . would you like the job ? <continued_utterance> painting it and tidying the garden ?
it can ' t be easy down there , <person> .
you ' re breaking my ribs !
what ?
i loved it , he .
<person> ' t he .
what . ? what is it ? why do you look like that ?
i think i ' m in love .
i just pulled and it - it came off .
this is great - great ! now we have to enter the front door !
come on , you guys . we have to think !
about what ?
it wouldn ' t matter . with <person> ' s testimony , i can get a new trial .
that ' s assuming <person> is even still there . chances are excellent he ' d be released by now . excellent .
a ' <number> contour . on my visa . back home , the security services ' d be up this guy ' s ass with a poker , but what do we do , we let him go .
. six teams on the ground , at least . well , pull ' em off the un . <person> back .
thanks ! that ' d be great .
you got that big retarded girl down there ?
<person> . <person> force has settled more issues in history than any other factor . the contrary opinion ' violence never solves anything ' is wishful thinking at its worst . <continued_utterance> people who forget that always pay . they pay with their lives and their freedom . <continued_utterance> you . tell me the moral difference,
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal
uh , no , i ' ve never tried it . but maybe someday .
your parents visit here ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
i can ' t believe what i just did . i innocently go to buy the nightgown and this amazing blonde salesgirl starts coming on to me . we wind up doing it standing up in front of a three-way mirror in the dressing room . <continued_utterance> if <person> would just marry me , i know i wouldn ' t do stuff like that -- it would be a legal violation .
as opposed to tonight ' s standing violation . you think marriage is going to make you faithful ?
the other side .
oh .
they don ' t hate you --
and what you ' re telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
<person> and misleading . why do you think he takes their skins , <person> ? thrill me with your wisdom .
it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies .
he was a damn fool . <person> and ambitious . <person> much in need of seasoning .
he turned out all right .
i think i ' d better be going .
just a minute -- what all has she been tellin ' you ?
i ' m not , i ' m head of english .
what really ?
no , you don ' t . <continued_utterance> that report . about the freighter ? you didn ' t find that tonight , did you ? <continued_utterance> you went right to the cell . then to the boat . then here . how long did you know about the freighter ? ishmael one day . <continued_utterance> this tastes horrible , hmmn ?
you ' re wondering why i held it .
how are you ? <person> . is your book going well ?
yes - i ' m on a good streak , thanks .
where should i look then , cole ?
look over there .
what friend ? kitty oh , it ' s nobody . <continued_utterance> i want to know .
nobody !
after you got six pieces you got ta get rid of ' em , of course you can ' t just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover , can ya ?
<person> , who is this man ?
the man with the pipe isn ' t here right now .
let me talk to him . this isn ' t right . i ' m not your prisoner .
no . <continued_utterance> leave him . get over there .
<person> ' s not be foolish , <person> . <person> , aren ' t they ?
<person> , everybody .
we brought you a little <person> tree .
i don ' t know where you get your delusions , laser brain .
laugh it up , fuzzball . but you didn ' t see us alone in the south passage . <continued_utterance> she expressed her true feelings for me .
i ' m sorry , mr . <person> , i don ' t think the jury heard that .
yes . it does .
alright .
what ' s your name ?
you can stop . i will go on alone .
we ' re too far away to walk . <person> ' t you understand ?
<person> , she ' s a fucking waitress in buellton . how would that ever work ?
why do you always focus on the negative ? <person> ' t you see how friendly she was to you ?
and you ?
i ' ll have the blackbeard over easy .
we ' re hundreds of miles from where you have to be .
<person> ! !
no . no . the worst was when i went in for this after-school special and i ' m sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids . i see they ' re all signed in for the same role as me .
they were auditioning for the same role as you ?
<person> , our position is <person> , section ten .
in the neutral zone .
did you guys hear that in china - or one a those places that makes the really cheap silk shoes and kids are super smart - that as a reward for good grades , mothers get their kids hookers to blow ' em ? all stop and look at her .
no .
what ?
coupons .
maybe pants .
a sweater .
<person> <number> , <number> .
<person> , and raise the rest .
you told me that about the last town .
<person> , but they never made a movie here .
if you are going to bully me like this , major , you had better do your homework . you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are .
<person> , you remember i said i had a question that he wouldn ' t be able to answer ? well , i ' m gon na ask it now . you ready for this , <person> ? it ' s a tough one . why didn ' t you get out right at the start when <person> came to power in <number> ? why didn ' t you leave germany ? <continued_utterance> i have a list of names here , people in your profession , who got out in ' <number> . <person> , <person> , arnold schoenberg , <person> .
here you go . here ' s a nice pin for you , for flying with us .
thank you .
would you like to see <person> again ? one last time ?
i don ' t understand .
someone else can help you . someone else can make you happy . <person> is crying now .
dr . <person> ?
i think i ' ve seen something on -- norah nods .
koko .
about <person> ?
about her past .
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators .
a coup d ' etat ?
<person> , major , why should he leave his country , his mother tongue , his family , his history , his past , his future , just because now , suddenly , there is a dictatorship ? why ?
but what . before that turns rotten . what if they surround the space with barbed wire , <person> ?
you fucking devious bastard .
i ' m devious ? i ' m a bastard ?
<person> for him you came by when you did . he might be dead now .
yes .
well . it ' s for you . <continued_utterance> just because . just because i love you . go ahead .
i ' m sorry , i just .
why don ' t you come in ?
uh-uh . you ' re on your own .
then what ?
in three years <person> will become the largest supplier of military computer systems . all stealth bombers are upgraded with <person> computers , becoming fully unmanned , <person> , the fly with a perfect operational record . <continued_utterance> basically . the <person> funding bill is passed . the system goes on-line <person> <number> th , <number> . human decisions are removed from strategic defense . <person> begins to learn , at a geometric rate . it becomes self-aware at <number> : <number> a . m . eastern time , <person> <number> .
you want this ticket ?
yes .
i find your lack of faith disturbing .
enough of this ! <person> , release him !
you ' re crazier than i thought , <person> . coming here . <person> ' s just in there .
<person> is dead . she was murdered .
him ? i don ' t know . he can be nice .
mph rmph rm rmph rm .
i went for a walk .
no you didn ' t . you took the car .
is there somebody else ?
nope .
mr . <person> , all stop .
all stop , sir .
but . there is no other time . <person> ' s up ! this is the only time . what ' s wrong with now ?
well , you ' re drunk . <person> , really , really drunk .
they loved you . i told you they would love you and they did .
i love you .
we had a date .
we did . ?
<person> is coming in to see you , mr . de<person> .
<person> ? lst assistant she must be a million years old . <continued_utterance> i hate to think where that puts me . i could be her father .
i don ' t have to sleep first ?
what ' s wrong ?
<person> . i bet it would be .
can i be your date for the reunion shooshoo ?
you guys ! seriously ! you guys !
what <person> ? !
i can give you more . let me think for a second . <continued_utterance> the freight car blows up from the fire . it spews gas , or what could be gas -- it might be chlorine , so they can ' t take any chances . <continued_utterance> so they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of new york city . and maybe that ' s part of the terrorists ' plan , right ? <continued_utterance> so . so who benefits from that ? what ' s vulnerable ? what ' s down there in lower manhattan ? <continued_utterance> <person> .
surprising himself with this insight .
they just found the van . <person> ' t look like they ' re gon na find any prints .
run him down , bring him in .
just recently i ' ve had a dream in english .
what was it ?
i don ' t think those cops did <person> . i think whoever <person> was wearing for killed her .
why ?
he has upset every bad boy in town , at some point , or another but nobody ' s got the nuts to knock him off because they aren ' t sure whether you can kill the bastard .
you really think he can find him ?
how much are your rooms ?
thirty-seven fifty for one person , forty-nine fifty for two .
no , i didn ' t . what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum .
<person> , conundrum .
let him have it . it ' s not wise to upset a wookiee .
but sir , nobody worries about upsetting a droid .
i ' m thinking i ' m going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on fifth .
why ? you love your place .
i ' m not . just a little poach job .
<person> .
no , wrong . i sell experiences .
<person> techno-perv jerkoffs .
<person> firmly . then what ?
line up where you want it .
you and me . that is the real world . come away with me .
you ' re crazy .
really ?
actually , i own my own business .
about my husbands ?
yes . and i was meaning to have a word with you . we could get an annulment .
right down to the kleenex i used . <person> , why ? is something wrong ?
he mentioned a name , at the very end . `` <person> . `` any followup on her ?
we ' ve had divers working around the clock . take a look at this .
how deep is he ?
. what . ?
what would you do with it , the printshop .
you do until six p . m .
<person> is cold ground . <person> over , ten months ago . our people worked it , so did the locals .
well , then put him at the singles table .
the problem with that is that then there ' s one extra --
is this yours ?
i ' m <person> . that ' s my dad . his name is <person> .
what he does with them - takes privacy . time , tools . he ' s in his <number> ' s or <number> ' s - he ' s got real physical strength , but combined with an older man ' s self-control . he ' s cautious , precise , never impulsive . this won ' t end in suicide , like they often do .
why not ?
it ' s not a strength of his . i ' m noticing that lately .
he ' s fine .
<person> . if you think it ' s okay . <continued_utterance> how can you be like that ?
i get undressed every day .
<person> --
<person> ' t call me that .
you mentioned that he had a learning disability .
that ' s right .
indefinitely .
how long is that ?
and all those like you .
you mean black people ?
sure .
my name is <person> -- that ' s with a k . k-r-i-n-k-l-e . i live at <number> <number> / <number> <person> , <person> , new jersey . zip code <number> . got that ?
<person> , yeah , with the kitten .
<person> died . it wasn ' t koko ' s fault . she was heartbroken .

candy .
fucking hell <person> . you alright bruv . i didn ' t even notice you .
what ' s going on ?
<person> <person> .
<person> liz . how ' re you doing . ?
there ' s so much other fun shit that is going to be going on that night . so , you know .
fun shit ? but i , like , never see you at any parties or anything .
philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared , but who knows for sure ?
he ' s not strong enough to fight off another attack .
be-nign . dr . <person> ' s penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end .
you have a fuzzy face .
sandy has a girlfriend , clenda . she ' s a weightlifter , but it ' s not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
i ' m not asking you to set me up , <person> . that ' s not what i need your help for . i want to know what it ' s like over there .
side .
up .
are you <person> bascomb ? i ' m to give the key to <number> y to <person> bascomb .
yes , i ' m <person> .
you got any broken bones ?
no , but something ' s gon na blow in this town . i can feel it .
<person> ' t . <person> ' t start with me . bastards completely shut me out . they got their own little cartel . little restaurant mafia . i bet they screwed with my car too . i wouldn ' t put it past `em . bunch of shady mother fuckers .
i need you to watch <person> .
speak out ! i know who i am . do you love stories of kings and queens ? feats of arms ? or is it courtly love ?
i love theatre . to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
i ' m doing this cake in celebration . well done .
to hardy .
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you ?
i think so .
we should go back . <continued_utterance> see if ama- <continued_utterance> what about <person> ? <continued_utterance> maybe he- salim shakes his head again .
- i saw him . he was with them .
<person> down , <person> . <person> ?
<person> ' t tell me to calm down !
that ' s quite a secret .
i spent a week reading <person> and watching re-runs of the twilight zone . <person> . i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
it ' ll take him a while to come around . a month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them i needed a wife --
you ' re kidding --
useless distractions .
it ' s like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?
major <person> said he ' d call to let us know .
that ' s big of him . <continued_utterance> <person> , better question the next witness . i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes .
who , here , could possibly care what you want ? at best , you ' re employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction . they have no idea what ' s going on up here . they ' ve never even been in space .
i am here to recover this mission , report my findings , and make a recommendation . now : what happened to him ?
honestly , it ' s a little old hat .
they don ' t ? then why do they still write me fan letters every day . why do they beg me for my photo- graphs ? because they want to see me , me , me ! <person> .
i feel i never should have said those things to you the other evening . i was pretty flustered , the rings and - and you looked so , i don ' t know . <person> shakes her head to silence him . ripley but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse , for a rainy day .
what are you going to do now , <person> ?
i ' d almost believe that . but i was behind the first aid station when you said the `` princess '' line . this park exists because the kids here work hard . they need to be treated fairly . they need to see you are just another lifeguard .
but i ' m not just another lifeguard .
i don ' t buy that .
it ' s the truth .
oh , sir . it was <person> ! we found him on <person> .
<person> , <person> . tell me what you can .
representative binks . i know i can count on you .
<person> betchen mesa bottums .
i can ' t just fuck off .
<person> , you can .
come here .
reese . you got a first name ?
they ' re meaningless . nerves firing . <person> chemistry .
you don ' t believe that . i ' ve been to places you haven ' t . i ' ve crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying . and when i do , that veil gets lifted for just a second . and what ' s there is real . maybe it ' s a vision of the next world , but i can see it .
we call him dough-boy cause he likes the dollars . he ' ll chase a buck straight into jersey .
look who ' s talking ? who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour ?
nope . no . i ' m not sure . i think he ended up marrying <person> .
wow . well it ' s so good to see you . let me get your info so i can send you an invite to the baby shower . <continued_utterance> it ' ll be like a big reunion . the whole gang from high school will be there . <continued_utterance> so what are you doing now ?
what makes you so sure it was me ? she coulda had lotsa bowlers ! theo rushes <person> and grabs his arm . the two men struggle for the pin .
<person> ' t say that about my mom !
what ?
is this crazy ?
it ' s not my fault .
<person> , we just lost the main rear deflector shield . one more direct hit on the back quarter and we ' re done for .
i don ' t care if it ' s a rental . this place is getting a fixing . <continued_utterance> this will be yours .
did you ask her if she could live in ?
promise what , <person> ? tell me !
<person> --
i never said i didn ' t .
<person> --
no , dude , all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works . <continued_utterance> just then the screen pops up . <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> . <person> , here we go . want to help <person> and <person> ? meet us for a meeting at gladdy ' s barn tomorrow night .
tell ' em we ' ll have pie and punch .
i understand you were <person> ' s lawyer ?
i was .
do you have anything to eat ? i don ' t know about anyone else , but i ' m starved .
how can you think of food at a time like this ?
and <person> told you that he ' ll tell that to .
mrs . <person> , if <person> <person> does not volunteer to say so in court , i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect . <continued_utterance> but in order to do that , you must let me bring a suit in your name <continued_utterance> charging negligent infliction of emotional harm . that ' s what i ' m now asking you to consider . <continued_utterance> it ' s clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event .
i told <person> all we had was a boatload of children but we ' re the only ship in the quadrant . <person> : those cadets of yours -- how good are they ? how will they respond under real pressure ?
like all living beings , admiral each according to his gifts . the ship is yours .
the princess ! put all sections on alert !
obi-wan is here . the force is with him .
how do you define perfection ?
a blending of the organic and the synthetic . the highest form of life in the galaxy .
i hadn ' t planned on it .
well , let me tell you something - don ' t . <person> ' t let them promote you . don ' t let them transfer you . don ' t let anything take you off the bridge of that ship . because while you ' re there , you can make a difference .
<person> ?
no .
-- there ' s got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft ? there ' s no such thing . our space program isn ' t even forty years old .
extraordinary , isn ' t it ?
so . nice ship you got here . what ' s our next move ?
remember you wanted to pay a call on the mcp ? <continued_utterance> we ' re on our way . <person>-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
we have to go to the wedding .
i am in no mood to go to any wedding .
are you crazy ? !
i just got this bucket back together . i ' m not going to let something tear it apart .
<person> night .
i ' ve lost half a pound since tuesday .
what did he say ?
he thinks you ' re being a little careless . he made the point several times .
dr . <person> , please ! <person> to your seat !
open the fucking door !
is she still angry ?
no . but i ' d stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you . i still don ' t know why you dropped her in the water .
what is it , general ?
my lord , the fleet has moves out of light-speed . com-scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the hoth system . the field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment .
i have traced the <person> spies to her . now she is my only link to find their secret base !
she ' ll die before she tells you anything .
you want to get off me ?
go ahead ! open your fucking soda !
dad ? <continued_utterance> dad , it ' s me . it ' s <person> . <continued_utterance> been a while , huh ? i ' d been meaning to call you , but -- <continued_utterance> he wanted me to stay on and take over the farm but . i had other ideas .
you ' re intimidated by him .
who ' s going to private school ?
nobody dad , we ' re just talking .
i have a message for you ; i love you . may i dedicate the next number to you ? . and the next , and the next . <person> sunday i ' ll buy you a new bonnet -

i know . this is a dream , <person> .
<person> , got an umbrella ?
nope .
oh , now , <person> , really ! i know <person> ' s been in some very awkward scrapes , but nothing so ridiculous as a murder .
but , mrs . <person> , you ' ve got to make him do something about this . <person> ' t you see that just one word from him would extricate guy from this dreadful situation ?
good . <person> . i ' ll be in new york with <person> , i can squeeze it in . she types in becky ' s idea .
you want to hear about destiny ? if my husband hadn ' t gone on a diet , which caused me to leave him , i would never have been on that flight to miami , and met <person> , and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a <number> with that nob you slide that says `` vacant-occupied , vacant- occupied , vacant-occupied '' --
<person> , captain . the ribbon has already entered the galaxy . it will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours .
<person> said <person> was trying to get back to the ribbon . if that ' s true , then there must be some connection with the amargosa star .
yes . your attitude have been very positive lately . <person> looks up at him . her voice is hopeful .
it has helped me a lot to have a goal , something to look forward to .
then why the rat ?
cause i ' m tired of bein ' his nigger . i want you to help me break him .
what about your agent ? hear anything yet ?
nope .
no .
what ' dya mean , no ?
it took me six months to find them all . i visited <number> different states but i came the furthest to see you .
i don ' t believe it .
i understand .
what do you do ?
<person> to me , very carefully , okay ? you ' re not a terminator any more . <person> ? you got that ? you can ' t just go around killing people !
<person> ?
<person> , young fellow .
<person> , mr . demille . <continued_utterance> last time i saw you was someplace very gay . i remember waving to you .
no idea . we have no surface support . it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater .
is it coming from our own computer ?
like this ?
no , no , that ' s too far . try a more gentle stroke . it ' s all in the stroke . go ahead , now , honey - stroke . as the camera comes around the side of the whale , we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman . his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it .
you got to tell ' em that you saw the accident . <person> ' t you ?
i can ' t do that . if i tell them , they ' ll , if i tell them , they ' ll try <person> for rape , they ' ll .
. <person> . ?
. <person> is airborne , five minutes out . standing down ' s a bitch .
every time i ' m on the lunch yard , and he ' s with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out-crowd henchmen .
you don ' t like his friends .
`` for now we see but through a glass darkly . `` he said he ' s a mirror .
of you ?

i so wanted to believe <person> . but the thalaron radiation can ' t be explained away . whatever he ' s after , it ' s not peace .

i would say he ' s been trained to resist telepathy . what i could sense of his emotions were erratic , very hard to follow .
is he sincere about wanting peace ?
what is good enough , judge ? another bus ? a school , maybe . these things come in waves .
waves mean nothing to me ; there ' s been a wave of violent crime committed by black people in this city for the past twenty years , but if you came to me with a plan to put all black people behind bars as a preventative measure i ' d send you packing . there ' s a price to be paid for living in a free society --
why not ? it ' s the way <person> made us .
i can ' t because <person> came back last night .
<person> ! come in a minute , dear . <continued_utterance> <person> , you ' re very much in my thoughts today .

it ' s ok , it ' s ok .
can you go to the farm ? just take a look , see if anyone ' s been in .
why not ?
there are different circuits . it ' s hard to explain . you wouldn ' t understand .

no . <person> placed that order was not a jedi , i can assure you .
the retard .
<person> , <person> , don ' t use that word .
that ' s not going to happen , <person> , unless you get us the help you promised us .
we ' ve been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public , it ' s been decided not to expand the search at this time .
stop you from what . ?
my destiny !
excuse me . glad you ' re okay . <person> luck .
no , stay . this involves you .
no .
are you hungry ?
duty . he lets the word resonate and then continues . <continued_utterance> a starship captain ' s life is filled with solemn duty . i have commanded men in battle . i have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies . i have represented the federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species . but none of this compares to my solemn duty as . best man . <continued_utterance> now , i know that on an occasion such as this : it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union . but have you two considered what you ' re doing to ? this is all a damned inconvenience . while you ' re happily settling in on the titan , i ' ll have to train a new first officer ; no doubt a stern martinet who ' ll quote the rule book at me and never . ever . allow me to go on away missions . . then there ' s the matter of my new counselor . undoubtedly some soft-spoken , willowy thing who ' ll be probing into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically . <person> ' t that right , <person> ? <continued_utterance> i notice dr . <person> laughing along with the rest of you . as most of you know , the doctor will also soon be leaving the enterprise , to assume command of <person> . <person> , i ' m forced to ask , beverly , have you considered what you ' re doing to little ole ' me ? ! i ' ll probably get some old battle- axe of a doctor who ' ll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if i don ' t show up for my physical on time !
it ' ll serve you right .
<person> , you know i really like you , <person> , but this is . it ' s just too intense . and i ' m so drunk i don ' t even know how to , like , process-
you ' re just being a pussy .

hmm .
i ' m done profiling you . i got you figured out .
a failed healer , a failed artist .

<person> , important for your label . which no doubt is why you ' re in mourning . <person> ' t worry , his records ' ll sell out now he ' s dead .
regula i is a scientific research laboratory , if memory serves .
i told <person> all we had was a boatload of children but we ' re the only ship in the quadrant . <person> : those cadets of yours -- how good are they ? how will they respond under real pressure ?

with who ?
<person> , younger ?
<person> and younger . i ' m in the middle . <continued_utterance> what ?
it ' s kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing . it ' s kinda cool . it ' s like you ' re in on some kind of secret . you tell a chick you ' ve been some place , it ' s like bragging that you know how to find it . the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there . you have to have someone come before . there is a direct line connecting you back to the original , unequivocally cool , club patrons . it ' s kinda like <person> .
sounds more like <person> .
<person> , sure , i guess .
no , i mean if he can get in , maybe i have a chance .
i do , but i ' m trying .
<person> . you were a senior when i started <person> .

she ' s lovely , isn ' t she ? -- so sweet -- honest , and helpless . <continued_utterance> pity you didn ' t fall in love with her , instead of me .
you might ' s well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin ' to get me .

'' instead i got drunk . <continued_utterance> that was thirty years ago . but the dark future which never came still exists for me , and it always will , like the traces of a dream lingering in the morning light . and the war against the machines goes on . or , to be more precise , the war against those who build the wrong machines . <continued_utterance> <person> fights the war differently than it was foretold . here , on the battlefield of the senate , the weapons are common sense . and hope .

why not ?
i dumped her .
my golly , you know ? all my life i grew up in the city , but every summer .
<person> ' t these illegal ?

we ' ve got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards . we ' ve got people pointing fingers , making side deals , and dickering over percentages . yesterday , i heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad . the rescue squad . because they didn ' t act fast enough . <continued_utterance> if you two dropped the case , then the others would come to their senses <continued_utterance> and follow . you ' re good sensible parents , you and <person> . people respect you . <continued_utterance> <person> .

no ' m , lady . <person> ' s up the street a piece .
hold up , hold up . any sentence that starts with `` at church camp '' ain ' t leading to the big `` o . ``

i like .

really ?
i am going to get my nut on this trip , <person> . and you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit .
<person> , now the cards are on the table .
<person> agrees that the b- <number> was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself . if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix , he should have all my abilities .

goddamn it , <person> , stop ! <person> ' t do that to yourself ! talking shitty pipedreams ! <person> ' s down there , and you ' re in here , and that ' s the way it is !
well , let ' s pray that ' s the only mistake you made . have you said anything to <person> about this ?
the timing has never seemed quite right .

<person> ! <person> !
<person> ? just drive .
those two guys were cops .

<person> . that imbecile . <person> ' t you understand , kid , that i am about to uncover the greatest discovery since <person> came up with his theory of relativity . the `` anti-force . ``

they ' ll get her out , if she ' s in there . you did your part , what the fuck do you want , a citation ?
. sir .
this isn ' t a --
dad !
i wouldn ' t worry about money .
maybe i ' d better take the rest of the script home and read it -
where ' s the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it ' s really just a springboard .
i was afraid of that .
you ' re an actor . find the zen in the role .
it ' s definitely a step back for me .
nice to meet you .
i think you were fantastic and you look great in the dress , too .
<person> , did <person> ever mention a man named <person> ? or <person> ? do you think she could ' ve had a friend you didn ' t know about ?
no way . she had a guy , i ' da known , believe me . <person> was her life , she was really great at it . <person> .
hey , um , i was in here the other day .
<person> , sure , did you find your guy ?

my mother .

not their style .
yeah . you gave up your hot tub tape to save me . that ' s real progress for you .
it was a tough call .
it ' s perfectly legal . go ask the irs , they ' ll say the same thing . actually , i feel silly telling you all this . i ' m sure you would have investigated the matter yourself .
<person> ' -a . i don ' t need no smart wife-killin ' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat .
i think so too .
it ' s forever you know .
i want to rent this one .
why don ' t you buy it , only forty bucks .
i think that ' s what it says on my driver ' s license .
and you have written pictures , haven ' t you ?
of course not . but you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift , and that ' ll cost you . a lawyer , for example .
ambulance-chaaing , highway-robbing cocksuckers !
i ' m going to kill myself .
they ' re only peppers , <person> .
<person> showed me the new dress .
getting so beautiful . she looks more like you every day . <person> . i ' ve really given this a lot of thought . a great deal of thought . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na marry <person> . i know you don ' t think much of her but she ' s a special person -- she really is . and i love her . this is a bridge we never wanted to cross but it ' s not helping her or the kids if i don ' t really commit to that . <person> stares at him stonefaced . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t think a phone call was appropriate .
this would be mine , sir . acting sergeant <person> . i ' ve assumed command on this mission .
<person> . ! i thought you were dead !
how easy is it to get inside , <person> ? how good are your sources in the mosques ? how many people you got in hamas -- ? <continued_utterance> no surveillance . i ' ve seen your deft touch .
<person> reports . we tap his phone .
you know her , probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out .
there ' s no place like home .
no .
it is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
fuck yeah , guys . we made it . <person> and safe .
i can ' t believe <person> ' s bottle broke .
<person> ?
s ' up <person> ?
just so you don ' t think i ' m a complete swine -- if there ' s anything in <person> you can use , take it . it ' s all yours .
well , for heaven ' s sake ! <continued_utterance> have a chair .
chocolate . dave disappears for moment . <continued_utterance> now , if he ever shows up at our back door , we owe him chicken and smoothies .
but . don ' t we get an employee discount ? <person> ' t we go in the front ?
yes .
if you could pick the shrimp off , as well as anything that touches the shrimp .
oh yes i would . but , you don ' t like girls your own age ?
i do very much . but i ' ve never met one i ' ve taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that ' s never happened to you before , don ' t you have to at least find out what it is ?
<person> , when i said i couldn ' t channel you . that didn ' t mean i wouldn ' t give my right arm to do just that . <continued_utterance> maybe i don ' t want to be looking over my shoulder . every day for twenty years . knowing someone else would have done it right . the way i can ' t .
trade you a smoke . for a secret . <continued_utterance> you know , i lost <person> awhile back ? in a supermarket .
i don ' t get to the movies much anymore . i ' ve got to go .
well , lunch . how about lunch ?
and i just want to know if i ' m crazy or not -- if what i think is happening is actually happening . or am i one of those people , those women , who are blind to what ' s going on ? who pretend not to see their husband ' s attention toward another woman ?
let ' s go home .
all set .
got ta check the gun first , <person> .
it ' s just as if i ' ve seen a ghost today .
but that wasn ' t your fault , dear , what happened to leslie . i ' ve told you that a million times . he goes to her gently ; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding , frightened eyes .
two . what are you gon na do with it ?
well . i don ' t know .
have you ever been a personal assistant ?
no , but i ' m the oldest of six kids , so i can pretty much handle anything you got .
you must have realized he was talking a lot of nonsense !
of course ! i didn ' t give it another thought . and now a lunatic wants me to kill his father .
you tell me .
<person> enough . we ' ll stick to business : how ' d ya like my old room ?
<person> ' t try to grow up too fast .
i am grown up . you said it yourself .
why can ' t we wait here for a ride ?
i feel better if i move .
he isn ' t safe in your house .
why do you say that ?
most people don ' t notice . this is from his prison series . he could see a mango grove through his cell window . he made some of the pigments himself . from flowers .
what was his crime ?
how the fuck can you be so sure ?
because he helped me recruit the network in iraq . okay ? <continued_utterance> we were part of the operation to destabilize <person> . printing up fake dinars , arming the kurds --
i can ' t remember very much . what it looked like or how long i was there . but i do remember how it felt . <continued_utterance> it was like being inside . joy . as if joy was a real thing that i could wrap around myself . i ' ve never been so content .
but then you were beamed away .
oh yeah ? we ' re just over in buellton . <person> .
oh yeah .
it sounds wonderful
do you think that would be a good line for a poem ?
negative . the t- <number> ' s highest probability for success now would be to copy <person> and wait for you to make contact with her .
oh , great . and what happens to her ?
maybe not . we ' ve received two communications -- from the bombers to `` release <person> . ``
we can ' t release him .
time travel . i always thought it was one of those myths . like <person> ' s reindeer .
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back ?
oh , no no no . i work concessions . at aokee ' s surf and <person> . it ' s just as well . the guards are mostly stuck up anyway . the rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun .
<person> ' t swim , huh ?
i ' m bleeding , <person> , i ' m bleeding .
. why am i here ?
frankly , mrs . <person> , i ' m a neutral observer for the united nations .
mrs . <person> laughs , enjoying his deftness ; then : <continued_utterance> what ' s your first name ?
well , what did i tell ya ?
you ' re a lucky man , all right .
what do you mean , you think ? what kind of shortcut ? ! he went completely the other way ! <person> lost him !
<person> , if we keep this chase going , that creeps gon na end up deep fried . personally , <person> very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for .
jesus , what a day ! <person> ' t it gorgeous ? and the ocean ' s just right over that ridge . <person> , the reason this region ' s great for <person> is that the cold air off the pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries . <person> ' s a very thin-skinned grape and doesn ' t like heat or humidity .
hey , <person> . i really hope your novel sells .
i ' ve always called you that . it is your name , isn ' t it ?
it ' s <person> . when you say <person> it ' s like i ' m still a little boy . and i ' m not .
i just wanted you to know i ' ve decided not to go to the wedding , so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable , you know , run-in or something , well , worry no more . you won ' t see me there . my wedding gift to you and what ' s- his-name . what is his name ?
<person> .
now it ' s hit and run driving ! and you knew about it all the time !
guy ? <person> , <person> anthony .
a psychic .
well . can we blame her . ?
even if that ' s what our own people are asking for , three to one ?
if the president is willing to declare a state of emergency --
did your people have any contingencies rehearsed ?
no . i guess we never thought it would happen .
<person> ' t bother me , norman .
it ' s not worth the risk .
we on for tomorrow night ?
after <person> .
once more:
she , uh . she had lunch with her father .
i means i wasn ' t what everyone thought i was . i was a fake .
you weren ' t a paper champion .
you said , `` you can ' t talk that way to a lady . `` you stood up for me . what do you have to drink ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! are you <person> ?
i , actually , yes .
<person> . ! i thought you were dead !
i ' m not , but alot of my soldiers are . glass the planet !
why do you keep calling me ma ' am ?
i ' m having a little problem here . i ' m trying not to freak out , but i think something ' s happened to me .
you cool the broad out ?
i left that for you .
yep .
what ?
why ? do you know something about him ?
i might if i saw the case file . you could get that for me .
hey ! thanks for meeting me .
god , i ' m delighted . thought you ' d never ask . you did ask , right ?
i don ' t pay for sex .
oh , you think if you get some girlfriend , or maybe a wife , you ain ' t gon na pay ? oh , you ' ll pay . but you won ' t ever be sure you ' re gon na get it . now with me , you pay , but you get it , and you get it good !
you should have told me .
it wouldn ' t have made any difference .
yes .
does it make you . hard ?
you ever seen <person> hitler ' s eyes when he was making a speech ? i ' ve seen ' em on films .
yes .
<person> your step !
what the fuck you doin ' ? !
i want to tell you something , <person> , he ' s a pussycat . my thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and i have to do that . now : what is this you want <person> hundred <person> to do what you ' re being paid to , you already signed you ' d do . ? what is that ?
i think i should talk to my agent , <person> , you and i should , we should really not discuss .
<person> , i saw the sign .
my name ain ' t <person> .
`` anguish '' by <person> . ? <continued_utterance> you ' re <person> ?
afternoon , <person> .
hey , <person> ! you look cute .
outta my way , fag . i ' m up . <continued_utterance> this really should have been my year . i had a lotta work done - i-i mean , y ' know , i ' d done a lotta work over the summer .
and her voice ? like lark song ?
deeper . <person> . none of your twittering larks ! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song .
it means i wasn ' t good enough to be a first violinist .
<person> , and according to your questionnaire , helmuth , you never joined the nazi party .
no . i love you .
i love you , too .
who ' s mr . <person> ?
he ' s a lawyer . he ' s our lawyer .
it ' s all right . the soldiers are gone for now . but be careful where you walk . and if it ' s too smoky , just come back .
yes , ma ' am .
where were you ?
i went to the wrestling , wanted to see that <person> , but he didn ' t show up .
<person> , whatever problems you have with j . j . - i didn ' t invent them ! what ' re you blaming me for ? if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off !
like you ?
<person> . `` <person> '' sent us .
she did , did she ? how is the old girl ?
. `` a boy named sue '' . i think that ' s why he ' s such a bad cat .
<person> ?
thank you . my suit -- <person> said she fixed it --
what happened to her ?
actually , no , she ' s a complete psycho . that ' s why she ' s up at pescedero . she tries to blow up a computer factory , but she got shot and arrested .
no shit ?
just what you see , pal .
the uzi <number> millimeter .
you are holding a jedi knight , obi- wan kenobi . i am formally requesting you turn him over to me , now .
he has been convicted of espionage , senator , and will be executed . in just a few hours , i believe .
<person> , i forgot you don ' t like flying , <person> .
i don ' t mind flying . but what you ' re doing is suicide !
nice meeting you , <person> .
you think my theory is okay , <person> ?
well , i don ' t know anyone named obi- wan , but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea . he ' s kind of a strange old hermit . <continued_utterance> i wonder who she is . it sounds like she ' s in trouble . i ' d better play back the whole thing .
he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system . he suggests that if you remove the bolt , he might be able to play back the entire recording .
i ' m a libra too . that ' s why we get along so well .
he looks like a killer .
and destroy every planet in the system . <continued_utterance> are any of them inhabited ?
veridian three is uninhabited . but <person> supports a pre- industrial humanoid society .
well , until now . tend the pin .
the only reason i mentioned her at all is to say that i ' m not going to talk about her anymore . i thought you ' d appreciate that .
now be careful , <person> . <continued_utterance> he made a fair move . screaming about it won ' t help you .
let him have it . it ' s not wise to upset a wookiee .
after all i ' ve done for you .
i feel i ' ve done a lot for you , too , <person> . so pull me up and we ' ll call it even .
<person> taken . <continued_utterance> when we get back , i want you to run that bug by the smithsonian , see if they can identify it . maybe it ' s got some limited range , or it only breeds at certain times of year . you found it , starling , you deserve the credit .
i ' m wondering if he ' s done that before - placed a cocoon , or an insect . it would be easy to miss in an autopsy , especially with a floater . can we check back on that ?
we haven ' t been issued weapons , sir .
you won ' t need weapons , <person> .
types his manuscripts , deals with his agent , makes his female characters convincing . <person> still at the door , listening . <continued_utterance> she even came up with the name dr inchcombe .

i don ' t know why i keep dreaming about her now . i haven ' t seen her since i was little .
<person> pass in time .
<person> system . there ' s not much there .

bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow .
people who do things are important . i never seem to do anything . <continued_utterance> i suppose you ' re going to southampton -- for the doubles .

oh ?
well , it ' s hard to explain . i can only tell you from my own experience . soon after i joined the orchestra , we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven , the eroica . there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani . one particular crescendo . during the break , i asked how he wanted it played . he was studying his score . he didn ' t look up . he said , ' just watch me . ' so , of course , i did . i never stopped watching him . the moment came . and suddenly , he turned to me and our eyes were locked . there was something in his look that . that simply demanded the crescendo . i shall never forget his look . it was a moment of . of magic .

<person> , <person> , it ' s a known fact there ' s a society of the five wealthiest people in the world , called the pentaverate , who run everything and meet three times a year at a secret country mansion in colorado , known as `` the meadows . ``

of course he did . he ' s been isloated for <number> years . he wants someone to talk to . <person> , you put a human being in isolation for four days , they can become neurotic , sometimes psychotic . we ' re talking about <number> years here . an alien that shows emotional responses . i think we need to address him , before he reacts further .
you think he killed <person> ?
you said something to him , didn ' t you ?

and it was here we pulled up - ever so slightly - pulled up closer --

<person> . i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player . <continued_utterance> `` what light is light , if silvia be not seen , what joy is joy , if silvia be not by ? unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection . <continued_utterance> `` except i be by silvia in the night , there is no music in the nightingale . unless i look on silvia in the day , there is no day for me to look upon . `` will interrupts `` him . ``

<person> !
<person> down , <person> . <continued_utterance> there seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news . i ' m sorry , <person> , to be the one to tell you . it concerns your wife . she ' s been murdered .
the police have been using everything but radar to locate you .
the guy ' s just breathing into the phone , maybe they ' re not even <person> .
i get the feeling you don ' t want to talk , but will you listen -- ? . whatever grievance you have , whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn ' t involve these children -- still no response .
so if i gave you my life , what would you do with it ? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now ? or could you change ? could you try to remember a mother ' s touch you never felt ? a father ' s words you never heard ? could you do that ?
i don ' t know .
let ' s go home .
you go home .
noooooooooooooo ! <continued_utterance> empty . now what do i do ?

i had kissed her once , when we were ten . looking at fish through a glass-bottomed box . it was just an impulse , and no big deal .
he ' s still got a good grip . we need to dig more .
the body ? yes , they showed me some remains that had been hit by a pickup truck . the upper body was crushed . there was no face . i got physically ill . <continued_utterance> you ' re not canadian , are you ?

i ' m suddenly quite happy to be going back .
that ' s good .
you think i haven ' t noticed how you ' ve been worming your way in ? you keep your hands off my wife , you low-rent pedant .
you ' ve abused her long enough / with your goddamn lies -
she lied ! she lied to us !
i told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion .
we think he ' s had a change of heart . so we should be celebrating .
i hope so .
it ' s not a boat boat . it ' s really a house .
but it ' s on the water .
it ' s cute . it ' s like a little clue . <continued_utterance> so he can ' t write . big deal . i mean , verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy , and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble .
i ' m going to run back to <person> ' s arms , if he ' s still have me .
<person> ?
no , no . don ' t say that . bad word .
oh , my god ! i got ta go !
yeah , screw this one up <person> and you ' ll be writing parking tickets for the rest of your days .

you love me ? ! i thought we decided not to fall in love . that we would be forced to live a lie .
i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway . my love for you is a puzzle , <person> , for which i have no answers . i can ' t control it . and now i don ' t care . i truly , deeply love you , and before we die i want you to know .
the walkers have agreed . the ottos . <person> ' s parents . it ' s important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that ' s why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears .
i know <person> and wendell walker . they wouldn ' t hire a goddamned lawyer . and the ottos wouldn ' t deal <continued_utterance> with you . we ' re not country bumpkins you can put a big city hustle on . you ' re trying to use us .
what ?
<person> ' t you understand ? he ' s torturing me . i ' m helpless . <person> ' t you get me out of here ?
i ' ve lost half a pound since tuesday .
<person> .

he ' s making him . <person> . <person> . he ' s --
we ' ll be working again , won ' t we , chief ? we ' ll make our greatest picture .

there ' s plenty of room at the new place and -- besides . i want to make us -- a life there . i want it to be ours .
it is ours . i bought it for us .
why can ' t i save those people on the train ?

i see an old man , set in his ways , afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a <person> regulation to tell him what to do .
i won ' t defend my life to you .
oh , i think he ' s a wonderful man .
you want to canvass ?
yeah .
how do you feel about him now ?

could you tell me where the bathroom is ?
<person> , what ' s it like when you go through time ?
white light . <person> . like being ripped inside out . slowly . like being born , maybe .
you are a woman of mystery , <person> . <person> and surprise . agnis silver melville says you was out there . be nice in yer story , she ' s payin ' for a piece of this house . <continued_utterance> you said upholstery . <person> said yacht uphol .

<person> ?
that was quite a day yesterday .
what ' s that piece for ?
it ' s a strut .
you ' re always thinking . <person> something for tomorrow . we have three boxes of evidence to go through .
pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss .
are you fucking spying ?
uhh . are you fucking spying ? <continued_utterance> <person> ! <person> .
i think you haven ' t decided yet .
get out of here .
i don ' t know . got it from <person> .
huh . let me see the label .
i think it ' s the best . <continued_utterance> . it ' s the only reason i ain ' t quit before now .
what ?
he ' s with me .
they don ' t know who they ' ve got . they just snatched `` some young girl '' . when they find out , they ' re going to have to .
because i was driving behind the bus , <person> . because i saw it . i saw it happen . <continued_utterance> if that bastard does subpoena me , if he forces me to go over this again , then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing .
that won ' t happen , <person> . <person> ' case is small , compared to some of those other guys . the way he told me , all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day , driving behind the bus . i know it ' s a painful thing to do , but it ' ll only take a few minutes of your time . that ' ll be the end of it .
still . how much commission you get on that popcorn ? bet you got ta sell a lot of corn to-
hey , the corn ' s good . really good . not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon . <continued_utterance> it ' ll get there . <person> time to get to know the market . develop a relationship with the buyers . but it ' ll get there . who doesn ' t like popcorn for <person> ' s sake .
take a top coat .
and leave a tip in every hat-check room in town ? he is already gone as she picks up the phone .
turns out i get this part . they ' re selling some dish soap or something , and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything . they lock this girl and i into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks , and then they shoot the commercial .
<person> ' t sound so terrible . you certainly learned how to dance .
i ' m sorry about <person> .
<person> ?
i know you wouldn ' t be saying all this if you didn ' t care about me .
<person> , i got ta get some sleep .
what ' s the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ?
<person> did you go in the sphere , <person> ?
your work is a disaster ! look at yourself !
<person> ? i don ' t matter . nobody matters anymore . to enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own .
<person> , calm down . <person> throws her keys at norah . <continued_utterance> well , if you had been here to help me but no , you ' re off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don ' t even matter . prove to your old cheerleading squad that you ' re not this huge loser . if you had been here doing your job it wouldn ' t have happened . so don ' t try to put all this on me .
this is on you . you did this . you set a fucking house on fire ! you .

<person> what ?
`` good night , good night . as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast . o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''
that ' s my line !
that makes total sense . why didn ' t i think of that ?
you just figure all this shit out as you go . experience .
you . she said i didn ' t love her .
was she right ?
there . you see lord <person> , she can be reasonable . continue with the operation . you may fire when ready .
what ?
can you do something for me ? <continued_utterance> think about what you want from our time together . what our goal should be ?
something i want ?
there he is . <person> .

he ' ll be through sooner or later .
how long have you worked here ?
<person> , i want to help you -- , there ' s nothing i won ' t do for you . you ' re all i ' ve got in the whole , wide world . <person> strides about , elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain . <continued_utterance> well , what have i got ? alimony to a pair of tramps ? they ' re of no concern to me . it ' s you who count , but don ' t get me wrong - i don ' t intend to let you break your neck again !
j . j . , you said you want to help me - prove it !
it ' s like . it ' s like this big pissed off god up in your face just screaming at you . so close you can smell the metal on his breath .
sounds great .
i did not . i got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off . along the way , i stopped and threw my gun into the royal river . i feel i ' ve been very clear on this point .
yes , you have . where i get hazy , though , is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed , riddled with . <number> caliber bullets . does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence , mr . <person> , or is it just me ?
maybe a couple million .
you ' re dreamin ' , kid .
actually . it ' s just my bed . <continued_utterance> actually , it ' s not . i just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that .
you don ' t smoke .
that ' s a lie ! they still want me !

the bear ' s got his claws back .
be smart about it .
<person> are we ever going to get in there ?
you got ta understand that this isn ' t exactly <person> and it ' s not exactly legal .
hey , you know what this apartment needs ? a really large oversized poster of atlantic city .
i used to live there . that ' s where i had my first supermarket job . <continued_utterance> i only have chamomile . i hope that ' s all right . <continued_utterance> it ' s north-south . for health reasons . see . i had this friend , he was a martial arts expert . anyways , he used to sleep north-south . i don ' t know . it ' s a martial arts thing and it just sort of became a habit with me . <continued_utterance> late ?
you staying out of the bars , <person> ?
yes sir . that i am .
me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months .
<person> , but that was for love .

hi , <person> . this is <person> again . could you just call me when you get in ? i ' ll be up for awhile , and i ' d just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all . he dials yet again .
hi . this is <person> . leave a message .
thank you .
you ' re welcome . can i take that for you ?
a synthetic opium analogue .
does it cause drowsiness ? that ' s all we need . to get him unconscious -- put him under .

that ' s not us .
huh .
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it ' s not even worthy of a response . i guess i ' ll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .
what ?
her husband works a night shift or something , and he comes home , and i ' m on the floor with my cock in his wife ' s ass .
the ones i read to teach <person> . they don ' t make me an exp . quoyle just . is she okay ?
i mean . if you had to guess .
think about what you ' re doing , <person> . are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons ?
it amazes me how little you know yourself .
hey , how ' bout we ask what ' s wrong with you ? there ' s nothing wr . woman sure , there is . this is <person> , and he has <person> ' s syndrome . it means he learns things very slowly .
maybe .
i thought you had more faith in me than that .
i ' m sure you ' re good , but all that paper leaves a trail . <person> gets too curious -- fbi , irs , whatever -- that trail ' s gon na lead to somebody .
<person> you help me ?
i will help you . but you have to go to the police and go to jail and -
i saw my mother . i saw her as clearly as i see you now . she ' s suffering , <person> . she is in pain . they ' re killing her ! i know i ' m disobeying my mandate to protect you , senator . i know i will be punished and possibly thrown out of the <person> order , but i must go . i have to help her ! i ' m sorry , <person> . i don ' t have a choice .
<person> , i told you i wouldn ' t let you give up your future for me . i ' ll go with you . that way you can continue to protect me , and you won ' t be disobeying your mandate .

you don ' t want to be friends .

what are you thinking , <person> ?
he has a powerful face , doesn ' t he ? he was one of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of knowing .
i never understood why he quit . only twenty jedi have ever left the order .
what ' s that like ?
well , you know , it ' s tough . a lot of traveling . a lot of hotels . but , you know , it ' s a dream . and the money ' s really good . i think i might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in vegas .
it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?
i can tell her you ' re all tied up in the projection room . i can give her the brush .

oh yes , <person> , i have recordings of all his symphonies . i kept them safe during the bombing . my favourite is the seventh symphony .
the ottos .
tell me about the ottos .
from the moment i met you , all those years ago , a day hasn ' t gone by when i haven ' t thought of you . and now that i ' m close to you again , i ' m in agony . the closer i get to you , the worse it gets . the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry . i feel dizzy . i can ' t breathe . i ' m haunted by the kiss you should never have given me . my heart is beating , hoping that kiss will not become a scar . you are in my very soul , tormenting me . what can i do ? i will do anything you ask . <continued_utterance> if you are suffering as much as i am , tell me .
. i can ' t . we can ' t . it ' s just not possible .
tell him the fbi is after him .
you ' re joking .
what ?
you have , i believe , some minimal background in music . therefore , you are to join our choir . <continued_utterance> page <number> <continued_utterance> you will sing , and you will sleep , ' that is your schedule until you depart . as almost no one attends <person> , you will be unable to cause further damage .
we all have one thing in common . we were all stupid enough to sign up for <person> . what ' s your excuse , <person> ?
well , my family is all farmers . i hate farming . <person> ' s pure picnic by comparison .
yeah . the end is built in to the beginning . what can you do ?
god . you ' re just perfect .
<person> !
<person> , it ' s getting terribly late , and <person> looks so tired .
she ' ll be easier to print if we turn her over . <person> , will you give me a hand ?
yessir , i will . clarice takes a jar from her kit , carefully drops the cocoon inside .
i really needed you tonight .
<person> , just get back in the jeep and assume the missionary position .
the exact words of the text . but do you understand it ?
uh , i don ' t know .
still , make a note i recognized that . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ?
what do you make of this ?
they ' re not shutting us out . they need men like me .
he ' ll fuck it up , the arrogant prick . you ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice ?
i get him to do it ?
he killed <person> , didn ' t he ? tell me , <person> !
no . like as my assistant .
i ' m not sure i can work with you , <person> . i ' m kind of angry .
but nothing ' s proven . the only thing you ' re actually sure she did so far is she ' s treated you like a king .
i dunno , <person> , i just .
who ? the other woman . your wife .
you are so damn sexy .
and the butfor ?
what ' s a butfor ?
i ' m sorry <person> , i guess you really do get it after all ! <person> smiles . music swells .
<person> . <person> would you like to go get some ice cream ?
i know of your fondness for antiques .

he woke me up too . <continued_utterance> you got milk on your top lip . <continued_utterance> what now ?
it ' s like you ' re always criticizing me .
i do . yes . um . do you ?
it ' d be fine .
where have you been , you almost blew it .
what ?
stay with you .
that ' s impossible- .
<person> , i know what i ' m doing . trust me . what ' s the news .
i can ' t believe i ' m doing this , but that girl who confused to <person> ' s murder also confessed to other murders .
tell you what , you send me an official inter-agency request for cooperation on this and i ' ll give you copies of everything we come up with . <person> , get your ass on out of here before you contaminate my crime scene any more than you already have .
there ' s no reason to be nasty .
<person> , i know you ' re not happy about this . but it wasn ' t my idea for your father to have some kind of mid-life crisis and disappear with his secretary to mexico with our life savings .
`` <person> . `` there ' s no such thing as a secretary anymore .
so he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy .
more like a kind of camouflage .
something just moves past my leg ! <person> ! did you see that ?
what ?
aye , you do .
i ' ll put it in the frig .
i ' m not leaving this room until you say yes .
get out .
yes . we must not give addresses or other personal informations .
i ' m her husband .
no , i don ' t -- you have them . here ' s <person> . `` my dearest <person> , i wake consumed with thoughts of you -- ''
<person> short guy . gives it all away up front . <continued_utterance> why are you reading this ?
all i know is she ' s beautiful . lots of soul . <person> for you . i ' m not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up . <person> ' t you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your <person> ?
hey , you mind keeping it down , buddy ?
really ? to italy ?
of course . <person> ' s say , for argument ' s sake , you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - i ' ll get a job - or , better still , i could get a place in rome and when we ' re there we could be there and if we ' re here we could be here -
. uh huh .
i saw the sign . at the cape . in the house .
i just -- i don ' t know what it matters what i think .
i loved the story . so interesting .
not that i don ' t like her - she ' s a very lovely person , but who can tell ? a year from now you might thank your stars that it turned out this way . by the way , <person> said that .
<person> , i don ' t want to make the benefit . they ' ll be jammin ' all night , and the way i feel -- i ' d like to be alone -- i ' d like just to walk and walk and never come back .
do you know what ' s going on with my computer ?
they took it .
<person> guy ?
seemed like our kind of people .
and grandmother .

look who ' s talking . are these your brothers ?
i liked the dog , for laughs .
but <person> i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . <person> love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?
her oxygen would have run out .
maybe she doesn ' t need any . should we check ? <continued_utterance> who are you trying to please ? yourself ? her ? which her , this one or that one . can you face both ? we are in a situation that is beyond morality . so : leave with her . you ' ll see the transformation .

and she ' s turned you into a servant .
what kind of a silly thing was that to do ?
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing .

i understand you ' re a man who knows how to get things .
i ' m sorry .

i don ' t see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that .
yes , dr . <person> was absolutely clear about this : politics and art must be kept separate .
politics and art must be kept separate . i ' ll remember that . but let me see if you can help me with something i just don ' t understand . i ' d really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him . what ' s his secret ?
do you ?
was she pretty ?
<person> ' a right i ' m mad ! i might kill every man in here . but first i ' m buyin ' my buddy here a drink . <person> ' neal ! you were right , your wife does give good head . <continued_utterance> <person> ! <person> por favor ! <person>ouble shots . make it tres <person> , huh . <person> ' but the best for my good friend <person> , the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad . hey , nice tie .

when <person> was little , he loved to hide . in the closets . under the sink . he always needed a secret place . but when i ' d look for him , he ' d always laugh . he wanted to be found .
yeah . well . i don ' t think he wants me to find him . well , i ' d better be going .
then forget me .
i ' ll wait at vt station . five o ' clock every day until you come . <continued_utterance> i love you .
<person> , it ' s slippery . i had it waxed . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s to us . <continued_utterance> you know , this floor used to be wood but i had it changed . <person> said there is nothing like tiles for a tango .

dr . <person> -
i have no plans to call on you , clarice , the world being more interesting with you in it . be sure you extend me the same courtesy .
unless we match their commitment with our own .
what about talking to this sheik ?
sure .
he ' s as big as <person> , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he ' s probably <person> and <person> rolled into one .
can be . can be . <continued_utterance> we got ta take any contaminated materials to the incinerators . so we ' ll need lots of space back here .
for the bloody stuff .
sid . you got me so . i don ' t know what . she is crying . <person> feels uncomfortable . not too generously , he relents:
you ought to be used to me by now .
two months .
why so briefly ?
i ' m not dumping you , i ' m suspending you .
sez you !
so what ' s coursing ?
they set two lurchers , they are dogs before you ask , on a hare , that ' s the big rabbit . and the hare has to outrun the dogs .
i ' ve been busy , mate . you alright ?
i need to get hold of some gear .
what ' s in those files ?
the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since <number> together with their questionnaires . <person> , what am i to tell dr . <person> ?
come on , <person> . i let you watch your nature show . <continued_utterance> is he coming over now ? right away ?
that ' s what he said .
yes . ! they were screaming .
so you ran away .
do you think it ' s <person> calling and hanging up ?
it couldn ' t sound crazier , but who else ?

<person> . i need to talk to you about those photographs . it ' s very important .
you have the key . tell me some good things about <person> . <person> ' t get up . just tell me some nice things .
good things about <person> ? could take some time ! . <person> is talented . <person> is tender . <person> is beautiful .
you have nice red in your cheeks now .
do you know what ' yo no quiero morir ' is ? <continued_utterance> it ' s spanish . it means . ' i don ' t want to die . ' not all the ghosts are scary , are they ? like mrs . <person> ?
oh , <person>r , you promised you ' d spend the night .
i . i can ' t , <person> . <person> wants to discuss my new findings .
<person> , i ' d say you ' re right on the money . <continued_utterance> is this <person>anie ' s kid ? sure is cute .
<person> , <person> ' s a sweetie .
indeed i am a bride short . how is this to end ?
as stories must when love ' s denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder . <continued_utterance> <person> , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it ' s time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
would you like to come and eat with us ? we can go somewhere over here on your side .
no , thank you .
you wish you were a chick ?
sometimes i think i might ' ve been better at it .
she was an honest person . doing the best she could .
the prosecutor , the judge , cut her off . she was desperate . her husband helpless . i was helpless . <continued_utterance> you couldn ' t let her . be helpless . <continued_utterance> when this verdict is read . she may look for your face . <continued_utterance> here ' s what she needs to see : this is nothing . we win it on appeal .
-- did you know i called you seven hours ago ?
i was gon na call you . i ' ve been jamming all day , it ' s my first day back .
good afternoon , clarice .
i thought you might want your drawings back . just until you get your view .
not every car , but . a car will stop . maybe not the first car . maybe number eight , number fifteen .
when do i get to <person> ?
morning , <person> .
hi , <person> . how was your night ?
i don ' t know . we fuck ? we continue to sort of flirt ? you divorce your wife and marry me and i make you happy for the very first time in your life and all your symptoms disappear ? <continued_utterance> we call it a day ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t choose the last one . i just said that one for effect .
do i have to choose at all ?
she looks like my third grade teacher . i hated my third grade teacher . hold it ! wait a minute ! she is my third grade teacher !
dad , you ' re not taking this seriously .
no . i mean , i remember mrs . <person> wearing some of this stuff , but . i don ' t feel funny about that . i really liked her .
and she really liked you . she would ' ve given you all this if she ' d outgrown it , or .
mary <person> . i ' m . mary <person> .
right . <person> . <person> . nice to know you . <continued_utterance> so , <person> , how long have you been in ? st . k ' s ?
naked . if you pardon the expression . you see , when <person> made me , he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering . it ' s so humiliating . how would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing ?
i guess i wouldn ' t like it at all .
and the chalk thing . <continued_utterance> and the time he locked <person> in the --
okay . what did he do this time ?
only one axe ?
they took the other one !
umm . and would admiral kirk have access to such information ?

senator <person> , i ' ve heard so much about you .
<person> , i assume .
. no . regrets .
you . knew .
<person> ' t do what , mister <person> ?
captain . i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear . . naked .
some people probably thought <person> was bad clear through .
people . are a cynical lot .
well , i ' m very , very disappointed to hear that . it makes me feel like a fool .
we weren ' t close . but we were connected . in a bad way .
s ' pose we could get it ?
he ' d never give it to me .
<person> , is that an old zeiss ? <continued_utterance> porro prism ?
eight by thirty <person> . no marks on the objectives . <person> bloom .
well . things are different . first , you have to be friends . you have to like each other . then you neck . this can go on for years . then you have tests . then you get to do it with a condom . the good news is , split the check .
i don ' t think it could let a woman pay for dinner .
i had mr . <person> to keep me company . <person> felt the time at all .
oh , they let you tote that record player down there , huh ? i could ' a swore they confiscated that stuff .
who are you calling ?
a systems analyst i met . very hot jewish guy .
you may be a little overdressed for this party . yo , <person> ! it ' s <person> . open up ! <continued_utterance> <person> , i got to talk to you , man . oh shit . <continued_utterance> he ' s been cooked-off
is he dead ?
i served in the --
<number> nd <person> , i know . <person> time i was running the --
what time is it ?
eleven a . m . they ' re gone . <continued_utterance> but they ' re not really gone . we just can ' t see them . early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night . <continued_utterance> it stopped dead in the air and fell straight down . <continued_utterance> they caught it on tape and they ' ve been playing it all morning . they found the bird . his head crushed in . when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky . they think they have some invisible shield thing going , like an optical illusion .
so where were we ?
new year ' s eve . i ' ll do it , okay ?
no way ! <continued_utterance> <person> shit . you ' re really real ! i mean . whoah !

<person> , a lot of people showed up .
<person> , so what do we say ?
well , she does know a lot about wine .
<person> . now we ' re getting somewhere .
how good ?
if i have an off day , he could win .
i ' m just calling to make sure you aren ' t hanging from your shower rod .
you called an hour too early .
<person> was crying for six hours straight and <person> was in with her all that time mostly saying , `` he ' ll be back . he ' ll be back . `` i ' ve got to get back to georgie .
i just hate that you had that kind of a night .
well .
we know you will follow in his footsteps . and honor his legacy .
i can ' t play anymore .
are you hurt ? what does that mean , you can ' t play ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
<person> not to smoke them . and i packed you a sandwich , just in case your blood sugar got low . and some of that iced-tea you like , and a nonfat , low cholesterol cookie . and a peach .
what a doll . got something else ?
what is the chief part ?
<person> . wit , swordsman , lover .
i ' ve had it with that bum , floyd .
you ' ve only been playin three hours , <person> .
me neither . it must be that you ' re married . do you get high , my friend ?
y ' know . sometimes .
i like it better in .
just roll with it . what ' s the worst that can happen ?
you think a whole orchestra , what , a hundred and forty or so guys , could be orchestrated ?
i guess it ' s possible .
we can ' t leave her out there . when the ship launches . she ' ll be killed .
tell her to go back to resurrection .
that was her line . it was on tv and everything .
that ' s pretty cool .
sure you can if you want to , and i know you ' ll want to . by the way , what ' s your beef against little <person> ?
when i ' m certain , i ' ll let you know .
i ' m <person> , mrs . <person> .
we are in your debt , miyamoto-san .
yes .
i tried it once . fourteen years ago . ' i was a lousy husband and a worse father . the only thing i ' m good at is this . at least until yesterday . <continued_utterance> how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing ' s helmet ?
do you want me to call the police ? then tell me why you took him .
he isn ' t safe in your house .
big deal . <continued_utterance> maybe we ' ll get a dog when we get back .
<person> .
i will kill you , <person> ' <person> .
i know . but we have work to do first .
he ' ll eat potroast and like it .
go you huskies ?
you see a lot , dr . <person> . but are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself ? how about it . ? look at yourself and write down the truth . or maybe you ' re afraid to .
you ' re a tough one , aren ' t you ?
we got word from chicago . they got one of the grifters last night .
what about the other one ?
and have them say what you did -- `` mr . <person> , how did you get him to do it ? '' and <person> would say we ' d planned it together .
oh , <person> -- what can we do ?
have you ever been in love with somebody who didn ' t return that love ?
yeah . <person> . i have .
then you ' re going to have to do it without me .
you ' re a career intelligence officer , <person> . you ' ll be in the air with us .
what is that ? what are you doing ? what do you want to do -- kill him ?
it ' s an idea .
well , at least there ' d be a trip to australia , if you made it .
we ' ll know more about that by the end of the week . <person> hurries in , nods briefly to the official who has started to leave , and sits down .
i don ' t know where we are .
you just keep it together . <continued_utterance> you put this on .
mr . <person> , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
so what do we do ?
are you kidding ? because i think it ' s good .
so do i .
i ' m looking for <person> .
no , kid . not available . plenty of others . take a look .
of course ! i didn ' t give it another thought . and now a lunatic wants me to kill his father .
it ' s too fantastic !
what are you going to do about <person> and that old bastard ?
just leave ' em . there ' s plenty of other girls .
are you hungry ?
hungry ? after twelve years in the burmese jungle . i am starving , <person> -- starving for a white shoulder --
. that . that he prayed for a second chance . but . do you see ?
yes .
i ' ll tell you , then . the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal <person> had shot himself . <person> to it . they listen . did they pick little k ' s recording ? did they pick some other conductor ? no , they picked you , and why ? because you represented them so beautifully . when the devil died , they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march . you were everything to them .
i have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely . in staying here , i believed i walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows . you seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t directly oppose the <person> because i told myself , that was not my job . if i had taken any active part in politics i could not have remained here . but as a musician , i am more than a citizen . i am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies . i know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of buchenwald and auschwitz than words .
a few ?
just kidding . i mean i would , but none of these white girls speak spanish . <person> plays in arizona . lots of mexicans ; everyone speaks spanish . he has like fifteen girlfriends .
no morgue . no hospital . no note .
the parents ?
that ' s very romantic . some of your fares must be interesting . see any stars , politicians , deliver any babies yet ?
well , no . not really . had some famous people in the cab . i got this guy who makes lasers . not regular lasers , not the big kind . little lasers , pocket sized , small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio , like a gun , you know . like a ray gun . zap .
so wait , wait , wait a minute . how do you get along in los angeles ?
i take the bus .
where we going ?
we have to leave the city , immediately . and avoid the authorities .
<person> , it ' s quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable .
not entirely stable ? i ' m glad you ' re here to tell us these things . <person> , take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive .
oh . `` i love you . i can ' t believe you ' re doing this . drugs are bad . `` whatever . after-school bullshit . the role is <person> .
`` big <person> '' , `` little <person> '' ?
<person> is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair . <person> gives him a supportive look . <person> buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen .
<person> , close to within transporter range .
<person> wants to destroy it .
well . he doesn ' t think it ' s god , but for different reasons than me . he ' s thinking : if i can figure out how to make it stop , than i am smarter than it is , and therefore it can not be god .
you mean -- worried about my testimony ?
no -- worried about you . personally .
i ' ve got the wrong room . <continued_utterance> arrest him .

death storm . <person> wave cracks her steel hull amidships , one inch crack from starboard to port . men go in the water . <person> lost . after a week . <continued_utterance> they come to <person> , call off the search . he stands like a stone . then turns , sharp , the way he does . says only , ' he ' s alive . and i know where . '
<person> ' s a witch .

i felt something with you , i didn ' t know really existed . you know what that ' s like after a twenty year marriage ? to feel something for another person that ' s so off the charts , that - okay , not your problem . this is why i ' m not good in relationships . you know writers are like teachers , those who can - do , those who can ' t - write romantic comedies where this does not happen in the third act . and it certainly does not happen to a <number> year old woman . in the play i ' ll be <number> so it won ' t be as pathetic . i ' m just too old to feel crushed . i ' ve written this feeling but i never really got it . you know what this is ? this is heart broken . how ' s that for impervious ?
felic .

<person> - stop it !
it ' s obvious he has feelings for you . are you saying , little baby sister , that you haven ' t noticed ?
released it about two months ago .
nice job .
i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response .

a cyclone ' s on it ' s way in . i thought they would have told you on the phone .
they didn ' t tell me anything .
i understand you ' re a man who knows how to get things .
i ' m known to locate certain things from time to time . they seem to fall into my hands . maybe it ' s ' cause i ' m irish .
tell me about <person> . what ' s he been up to ? he seems so preoccupied .
oh , you know <person> . he ' s all caught up in some kind of study he ' s doing . things are really crazy at the university now . things are crazy . everywhere . i guess <person> ' s just . well , you know . pulled into his shell .
<person> shit .

i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
well , who ' s it by ? the label ?
no one . i found it in a vintage shop .

sometimes i think that when you get high or drink or alter your consciousness like that --
i saw her . she looked just like this --
this is a photo of hair .
who was that ?
nothing , geezer wanted to talk to me about a job .
that lady seemed really sad .
her husband died .

<person> looks up at sidney as he continues .
that ' s your problem , <person> .
as if she ' d even be attracted to guys like us in the first place .
<person> , so she was old enough not to feel <person> was walking out on her .
is that supposed to mean <person> walked out on me ? why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy ' s the one who wanted out ? just because once we broke up he shtupped everything that moved .
twenty carats ?
best stone i ' ve seen in years .
<person> , it was a formal party .

it plays in <number> states .
i was sleeping .
oh , shit -- i ' m sorry .

or <person> ' s end of the world experiment . or both !
it ' s over .
that ' s <person> ' s dog . perhaps he ' s come to beat the shit out of you - good !
worked . like a charm . believe this . <continued_utterance> she was beaten , and bloodied , and it was going to go on , uni .
so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck . <continued_utterance> you taught my child that i am some limp dick <continued_utterance> you think <continued_utterance> well , maybe real growth .

he can ' t manifest .
and this vacuum whooshed all this money out of everyone ' s pockets .

no stay !
no , no , really . obviously you ' ve got things you have to do . you ' ve got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso . dig a makeshift shallow grave . cover the body with quick lime . really so much to do , so little time and i ' m only in the way here , i ' m just gon na go . <person> luck .
<person> .
yes , rude boy .
uh , we ' re just , starting our program .
this is not a place for fun and games ! this is rehabilitation ! now get to it ! ! we at mac have a trial to go to !
<person> to me . something ' s wrong . i was flying a mission . i was in a chopper . then i woke up on a train . now i ' m here . can you explain that ? what unit is this ?
you ' re with beleaguered castle .
pain causes it ?
uh-unh , no , it ' s different . it ' s when there ' s nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway . you get it ?
what are you going to report back to earth ?
i don ' t know .
the best part was that there was a ' this ' . to debate the wrongness of . <continued_utterance> your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .
we ' re japanese , not mexican , ishmael . he ' ll slice you up with a ceremonial sword . <continued_utterance> my mom . would be the problem .

the gas station guy . i thought he was chasing us for a while , but i guess he stopped .
i don ' t believe it , i simply don ' t .
can we carry on mr . <person> .
countdown to what ?
i don ' t know , but whatever it is , it ' s only six hours away .
<person>
i rejoiced at his death because i thought it was yours . that is all i know of <person> .
well . i suppose it does a bit . i ' m very happy for them , of course , but i ' m going to miss them . the ship will seem . incomplete without them .
that is because you have a familiarity with them . you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge .
i don ' t know what you ' re going to do , but as me for me , i ' m gon na schedule some practice time of my own .
this may take a lot more than extra practice .
it ' s okay .
i asked <person> but she was busy tonight and you ' re the next best thing . i mean , it isn ' t that you ' re the next best thing but because you play her , it feels comforting . does that make sense ? although the thing is offstage you ' re nothing like her . you play her very well though . did <person> mention what she was doing tonight because i called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn ' t going to be back till late and i thought that was weird because she told me <person> was sick .
well , don ' t have kittens . <person> is going to work . they ' ll remember you in a wreath with newton , <person> , surak .
thanks a lot . no respect from my offspring --
whar you off to ?

and are you also suggesting that she forgive big ?
<person> , against that prick vandemark .

`` i ' m only following orders '' didn ' t work at nuremberg . it may not be your policy but they ' re your tactics .
i said that ? <person> , i ' ll take it for five , and you ' ll make out okay , because in this case it ' s pure cream , you don ' t have to cut anything back to the wearer .

uh , what does that mean , `` the hammer '' ?
you and <person> . that ' s a nice piece of work isn ' t it ?
<person> is utterly dismayed .
we were supposed to go to college together ! since elementary school ! what ever happened to that !

i hear you . how many days a week do you rehearse ?
two days . an hour or so .

my father had bought the desoto fifteen years before . driving it reminded me of him . which i considered a neutral fact . <continued_utterance> actually , it was pleasant . <continued_utterance> <person> made all the fields into one . the notion that one man might kill another for a small patch , made no sense . <continued_utterance> but i knew such things occurred . having been to war and all . <continued_utterance> may i give you folks a lift ? <continued_utterance> i didn ' t look at her . i thought that would be best .

`` <person> thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . <person>ly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ``

it says nothing of this in the guide book .

<person> was right . i don ' t understand why you ' re with <person> .
he ' s nice . he ' s available . he fucks me without crying .
`` no fate . `` no fate but what we make . my father told her this . i mean i made him memorize it , up in the future , as a message to her -- never mind . <person> , the whole thing goes `` the future is not set . there is no fate but what we make for ourselves . ``
she intends to change the future somehow .
you take a hockey puck in the face ?
a fist . my stepdad socked me . i flew across the room and dented the sheetrock in the kitchen . my mom saw everything and still took his side .
no i didn ' t !
of course you did ! we were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it ! that ' s the definition of bailing !
jamal , hello . you have done well . it ' s time for you to- turn professional .

moral turp . you ' re on my home court , friend . i have the mayor and the town behind me , and forget making your movie : i may own the studio when i get through with you : i got a civil suit , i got rape , i got collusion .

yes , sir !
your photos suck . <person> , my readers are morons . i got ta grab them by the eyes . every time you press the button of that nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents . so the next time you ' re about to take the plunge , ask yourself , am i taking dog bites man ?
you ought to stop this nonsense , <person> , these two dollar bets .
it ' s compensation , <person> , for the marginal life we lead . <person> , did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
i ' m not .
let me be the judge of that . <continued_utterance> there ' s an amazing thing when a woman has a daughter . one day you look up , and you see . a sister . someone . you can say . anything to . <continued_utterance> i wrote a whole lot of letters . to each of you . and the envelope says when to open it . like , which birthday . or . when you get your driver ' s permit . first time you see rome . things like that . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s for awhile , okay ? until he ' s old enough to not open them all at once .

eight years at miss vickie ' s studio of dance . what surprises me is you .

thanks for coming out .
neutral ground . what ' s up ?
suppose you listen just for a minute -
madame is waiting .
it ' s getting published . that ' s what we ' re up here celebrating .
that ' s fantastic . congratulations . <continued_utterance> are you a writer too ?

<person> back . how are you feeling ?
i can explain .
<person> promised me he would never take off this ring .

why ' d he do that ?
<person> ? what ' s wrong ? <person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> my father died .
oh , baby .
what is this ? this isn ' t enough .
it ' s all i have .

steering wheel .
but you did have sex with her ?
hello .
this way . nothing to see . <person> on .
right this way , please .
number one , the girl ' s dead . number two , the hide-out gun the agent shot with ' s registered in his <number> for the past five years . the man who tossed him has been sacked . his name is none of your concern . now : what the fuck are you doing here ?
sir , i am not here to question .
<person> . what about quiet time ?
right . there ' s no real curfew , but you must be quiet after ten .
it ' s okay . it ' s different crying this time . i can tell . i ' m crying , too . and i cried last time . after you left . i never told you . but i cried , too .
i have a title . the obscure moon lighting an obscure world .
stop . you ' re making me insecure .
you changed your hair .
i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .
<person> enough .
now see a thirty year old gets that .
you mean falls for that .
aw man -- got ta have the new batman .
it ' s there near the tree .
<person> , eating at the core , eating it ' s way out . it makes me sick ! <continued_utterance> how do you turn this thing off ?
wait ! that ' s an aria !
she ' ll come back , don ' t worry . but then what ? my theory is she can only live here , that she will die if she leaves this ship . <continued_utterance> why do you think she hasn ' t suggested that ? it ' s the most obvious solution : <person> . she knows she can ' t leave here --
get out --
so what ' s up ?
just seeing how you ' re doing . and , um , <person> and i were starting to look over the seating charts again , and we ' re wondering if you wanted <person> to sit next to the feldmans , or should he be at one of the singles tables ? <continued_utterance> so what do you think ? with the feldmans ?
even your play .
oh
<person> , need to ask you something . you heard this rumour the british found something called the <person> archive ?
yes .
remember when <person> and <person> got divorced ?
and we all went through that together ? on ben . oh my god . he knew it !
are you allowed to love ? i thought that was forbidden for a jedi .
attachment is forbidden . possession is forbidden . compassion , which i would define as unconditional love , is central to a jedi ' s life , so you might say we ' re encouraged to love .
i heard them talking . they both thought you were money .
<person> , a good friend .
look , i don ' t have time to fuck around . there ' s somebody out there i don ' t need to see . you got a fire escape or anything ?
no .
my ass is falling . it is .
what are you talking about ?
my name ain ' t <person> .
i saw the sign . i saw it . at the beach house . i ' m going back .
what happens if i don ' t want to assume this woman ' s identity and raise my babies with a serial killer ?
<person> , don ' t be morbid . if anyone can deal with this , you can . i know you felt what i felt . it ' s real .
we told them <person> was at the waverly theater . flan sixth avenue and <person> . the lobby . <continued_utterance> but we had promised <person> that we would
well , <person> did .
i like griftin ' .
you could buy yourself some things .
females - logan , utah ; and <person> , <person> . <continued_utterance> so is this what happens when an agent spins out ? he gets deleted ?
sometimes . the lucky ones get sent to <person> . <continued_utterance> friend of the receptionist , missing for about a year now . i told her i ' d let her know if the body ever turned up .
i don ' t know ! ! !
i can ' t . hold on ! spidey thwips her and she grabs onto the web .
he ' s still being . debriefed . they ' re not ready to go public with charges .
what else you got on his followers .
i did something really bad -- i think . <continued_utterance> i said something to <person> . at the rehearsal dinner .
what do you mean ?
that right ?
your clones are very impressive .
prepare to transport me to the surface .
<person> . when do we get our payment ?
it ' s got a lot of good things . of course , it would be an expensive picture .
i don ' t care about the money . i just want to work again . you don ' t know what it means to know that you want me .
i am done with theatre . the playhouse is for dreamers . <person> where the dream has brought us .
it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .
<person> idea .
<person> na be good as new .
well , you just came from the liquor store , give us your liquor .
i didn ' t get any . they ' re not letting anyone in . they ' re arresting someone or something .
ah , see , that ' s the thing . somehow they don ' t come back until you really don ' t care anymore .
there ' s the rub .
go ultimate .
i ' ll keep in touch .
do i hear fifty thousand ?
fifty fucking thousand !
<person> . i just wan na do a quick twenty minutes on the stair master before bed . <continued_utterance> i ' ll do forty tomorrow .
i got something much healthier for you than that .
<person> , victoria ' s nice .
would you follow her through an airport ?
mrs . <person> , there is no such thing as an accident . the word doesn ' t mean anything to me . as far as i ' m concerned , somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner . some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement . they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference . that ' s what ' s done , mrs . <person> . i ' ve seen it happen so many times before .
but <person> said she saw a dog and tried to .
thanks . hey , i talked to maya this morning . she said she had a good time too . you should call her . <continued_utterance> where ' s <person> ?
he had to make a phone call .
i know . and that ' s what ' s irritating , you ' re too nice .
too nice ! ?
so , i ' m some great date , huh ?
yeah . mr . excitement .
<person> birthday , <person> .

yes , <person> , can i help you ?
i ' d like to put in an announcement of my parents forty-fifth wedding anniversary .

<person> acted in a cough syrup commercial . he thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic . he said the play sucked big time .
you know how to work this thing ?
no idea .
norman .
what are they ?
i ' m right here . i ' m fine . what ' s the dog ' s name ?
max .
was it a butterfly ?
a moth . how did you predict that ?
oh . <person> . that ' s good then . <continued_utterance> my son-in-law ' s coming to take me to lunch at the <person> ' s . they have such nice rolls there .
would you like to sit for a moment , mrs . <person> ?
i read the same article .
it takes time --
<person> that ! the last part ' s the best . you dry-dive six stories and blammo ! <person> right into the big black .
i don ' t deal black-jack clips ! it ' s policy . i got ethics here .
yes , isn ' t it ?
you mean you ' ve known about <person> all this time ? <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
we ' re too far away to walk . <person> ' t you understand ?
i can ' t stay here . i want to go home . i don ' t want this skin . i don ' t want to look like this .
what are you doing ?
i need a sample of your blood . what do your borg friends say ? resistance is futile . <continued_utterance> yes . the bait you couldn ' t refuse . i learned there might be an existing prototype from a cardassian historian , then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on <person> . i knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the enterprise the closest ship to romulus when i contacted <person> .
you need money , you come to me . <continued_utterance> who the fuck do you think you are , raising cash without coming to me ?
your ex-partner . i ' m buying you out , <person> . read the contract .
well , if the blood got <continued_utterance> you don ' t . <continued_utterance> the coroner testified that <person> had a cut . a fresh cut . probably one or two hours old . <continued_utterance> on the palm . of his right hand . <continued_utterance> with no bone or scalp or hair present . would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man ' s skull .
i ' m a hemotologist , not a detective .
driving calms me !
when you ' re in one of these moods you do not drive well and i do not want to be killed today .
no . this was bad . but for the three days it was good , it was electrifying . <person> ' s eyes fill up . <continued_utterance> i think you must consider the possibility that we are more alike than you realize . i let someone in and i had the time of my life .
i ' ve never had the time of my life .
yeah . can i help you ?
i like your work .
no ! i went to a museum ! i liked toulouse-lautrec !
as well you should .
edwin von der <person> . <person> critic . he gave <person> terrible reviews while he raved about <person> von <person> .
who ' s he ?
wait a minute . i thought you ' ve always been afraid it would overload your neural net .
that is true . however , i believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse . for thirty-four years i have endeavored to become more `` human '' - to grow beyond my original programming . and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor . this emotion chip is the only answer .
she what ? when ?
about a month ago . six weeks .
it ' s <person> . when you say <person> it ' s like i ' m still a little boy . and i ' m not .
i ' m sorry , <person> . it ' s impossible to deny you ' ve . . that you ' ve grown up .

whilst i ' m not convinced he actually cheated , i have got- the <person> brandishes the file .
- <person> himself- a man of great standing and integrity- said the kid was a liar and a cheat . what more do you need ?
her husband died .
so he ' s in heaven ? <continued_utterance> maybe we could let her use our cb and she could talk to him . <continued_utterance> maybe he would hear her .
hans <person> was in the ministry of culture ; how could i know such a man ? i brief silence ; a smile . <continued_utterance> i hear the british have his . his archive , files , records .
do you know what ' s in this archive ?
what are you talking about ? money ? what about <person> ?
that doesn ' t matter anymore . i just lost a hundred dollars of <person> ' money !
. and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles , further and further down . then i ' ll pull off your panties with my teeth .

this sunday ' s hymn is inspired by the lesson of <person> . you know the one . <person> was a young lady with a past . she was no stranger to sin . she was no stranger to practically everybody . many condemned her . the whole neighborhood . but one man refused to do so . one man said , hey now , wait a minute . <person> to the story . <continued_utterance> hey , girls .

if he could be turned , he would become a powerful ally .
where have you been since then ?
i ' ve been backpacking .
only asking . i did ' t know you were planning a comeback .
i hate that word . it is a return . a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen .
folks who run this place love surprise inspections . they turn a blind eye to some things , but not a gadget like that . they ' ll find it , and you ' ll lose it . mention my name , we ' ll never do business again . not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum .
i understand . thank you , mr . ?

`` my thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved . i can live only wholly with you or not at all . ``

my god ! who are we fighting here !
i think . i think we have to assume the missing men are . down .
because i respect her ! i ' m not going to put that kind of unfair pressure on her .
these aren ' t girls , they ' re women ! they need our dicks as much as we need their poons - and we all love liquor , so where ' s the fucking beef ? !

<person> . the police department can not resolve your problem . you need to get permits from the coroner and health and safety department . you pay for an exhumation . you have someone qualified examine the remains . if it is the wrong body , the forensic examiner will confirm there is a problem and call us . then we open an investigation . no , <person> police will investigate . he is buried there , no ?
ticket ?

i don ' t know , <person> . i ' m not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when <person> came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page <number> . how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page <number> talks about a giant squid .
which i told <person> was attacking --
did you say two o ' clock .
yeah .
i do not understand . the optical data network has been repaired , and all systems are functioning .
your diagnostics are in error . i need weapons .

and when did you first learn . that <person> had drowned ?
i ' m sorry about that . it wasn ' t mine in the first place . <continued_utterance> so the fishing gaff method wouldn ' t make sense ?
couldn ' t get on the boat . i ' d just <continued_utterance> no sense to have
that ' s when you went in the sphere .

that ' s your uncle talking .
<person> , ok , whatever you say . just answer one question . is anything wrong ? <person> said you might be in trouble .
you talked to <person> ? when ?
looks kinda like she ' s formed an attachment . <continued_utterance> for the locality , i mean .
i wanted so much to give ranch life a trial , but fear circumstances are against me , especially in view of the recent indian trouble --
i know your face , you ' re an up-and-comer . you bowl on the tour .
i ' m not on the tour this year .
if anyone orders <person> , i ' m leaving . i am not drinking any fucking <person> !
<person> , okay . <person> , <person> , <person> . no <person> . did you bring your xanax ? <continued_utterance> and don ' t drink too much . i don ' t want you going to the dark side or passing out . do you hear me ? no going to the dark side .

i said , let go of my bag .
and what would this concessions kid have to do ?

because it had to look random . not connected to anything or anyone . but then why give the rape to me ?

it ' s a five-star resort .
i ' m not sure . it started with <person> . he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door . he covered the video lens . obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown . i don ' t know why he didn ' t tell us he had somebody in there . by this time , we were getting visitors , too . he was desperately trying to figure it out . day and night . who was she ?
my wife .
my heart aches so much for you .
we ' re here , <person> . i ' m here .

the food ' s supposed to be really great here . marianne nods , doesn ' t look amused- <continued_utterance> no , no , no , no . i ' m not . i ' m not saying it like that . i mean , i just mean , you know . one person for the rest of your life ? i mean , it ' s . i mean , you know , you come to restaurants , you see couples sitting together and they don ' t even speak to one another . they don ' t have anything to say , they don ' t have anything .
<person> , three fifty-five , three --
<person> up and catch .

oh , yes . so go lecture yourself . you won ' t need a translator for that one . i mean what am i lately . a recycling bin ? . just anyone dump in your garbage and hope i make something useful out of it . <continued_utterance> yes , you did the same thing . you think i didn ' t know about altering those outfits for <person> . she tells me her stuff . so , am i missing something ? is there a real difference between that and what you are complaining about ? cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
uh , thanks , but . i don ' t even know what i ' m doing here .
you believe in the users ?
if you don ' t mind , mam , i ' d be mighty pleased if you ' d go out and have some coffee and pie with me .
why ?
no , i think your mother , her illness -
it ' s got nothing to do with my mother ! she ' s had leukemia for - ! this is what makes me boil about him ! he wants me back ! - it ' s got nothing to do with my mother .
i can ' t be absolutely sure - <number> ? <number> ? we ' d both taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark , it was certainly dark when i walked him down to his car .
so <person> drove away and you did what ?
these here are the real deal . i want you to have them .
<person> , you promised him those others . from the store . he ' s been talking about it for weeks .
you mentioned growth acceleration .
oh yes , it ' s essential . <person> , a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow . now , we can do it in half the time . those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago , when sido-dyas first placed the order , and they ' re already mature .
space ?
up there . i . eh . can ' t explain . but that ' s the only place you could be from .
sure you did . that ' s what makes it great . what it needs is a little more dialogue .
what for ? i can say anything i want with my eyes .
you ' re holding out on me .
<person> .
yes .
so if i gave you my life , what would you do with it ? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now ? or could you change ? could you try to remember a mother ' s touch you never felt ? a father ' s words you never heard ? could you do that ?
if you talk to <person> , he ' ll assign you to something .
if you don ' t mind , mam , i ' d rather work for you .
because you weren ' t wasting my time .
do you have something you use , when you need to get up your courage ? memories , tableaux . scenes from your early life ?
i thought i would still be in extreme pain but i ' m feeling nothing . <continued_utterance> i ' d like a little more nothing . <continued_utterance> i had gone from little women to <person> . <continued_utterance> yes , i ' m still jilted .
what the hell got into him ? he was perfectly fine at the dinner .
<person> .
hey , evelyn , it ' s your favorite client .

but i ' ve learned so much .
me too .
<person> , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why don ' t you take the weekend . . that way you ' ll be there , and i ' ll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .

<person> , what ' s up ?
i have a job for you .
who knows . where ' d you learn cpr ?

<person> soran . ?
yes , yes , captain -- thank you for coming .
<person> to disappoint you , <person> . this party ' s over .
<person> , but stupid , my old jedi friend . you ' re impossibly outnumbered .
all ' aperto ? col freddo che ha fatto ?
he thinks it ' s very cold to be sleeping outside .
you can ' t take <person> ' s children away from him .
bi-coastal parenting . <person> every day . <person> gets the kids every other summer , every other holiday , it ' s not ideal , but people make it work , and .
<person> , he ' s assimilating a lot of programming . remember , he ' s a prototype , a lot less sophisticated than you are . we just don ' t know if his matrix will be able to adapt . or if he ' ll be able to retain anything . we should give him some time .
what purpose does this serve ?
<person> has never seen anything l_ <number> e here . i wish she was . who do we dance with ? the orchestra segues into a tango . paul stands . <continued_utterance> we ' re guys .

affirmative , admiral .
i thought you were going to check under my bed .
no monsters .
where ?
anywhere ! oh ! !
yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , i heard all about that .
in a dictatorship , art belongs to the party . if you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .
help me ! ! !
hey , she doesn ' t want to go with you . come on . <continued_utterance> oh god , man . don ' t shoot me . my mistake . i ' m sorry .
well , anyone who gets you is lucky .

you got ta give <person> one thing . he ' s good with the ladies .
i ' m too tired for this . <person> ' s just go .
you never know what ' s over the horizon , <person> . <person> too long you ' ll be offered a command of your own . <person> looks at him ; he has never really considered this .

great . now even i don ' t recognize me .
<person> .

<person> to know where there ' s one for sale .

i don ' t think that ' s a good idea , <person> .
<person> .

you told me that your boy was washed up with <person> , didn ' t you ?
well , you waited for good reason , and you proposed to <person> for some good reason . so i think it ' s great . it ' s time . you ' ve got to have your eyes open , that ' s all . i mean , look at me . i thought victoria and i were set for life .
<person> ' s dad -- he ' s been talking about bringing me into his property business . showing me the ropes . and that ' s something , considering how long it took him to get over i ' m not armenian . so i ' m thinking about it . but i don ' t know , might get a little incestuous . but <person> does pretty well . a lot of high-end commercial stuff .

you know , counselor . i ' m not getting any younger . for some time now , i ' ve been aware that there are fewer days ahead than there are behind . but i always took comfort in the fact that when i was gone , my family would continue . but now . <continued_utterance> i ' ve had brushes with death . more than i care to contemplate . i always accepted it as a calculated risk that goes along with wearing this uniform . but now . the idea of death has a terrible sense of finality to it . <continued_utterance> i ' m the last picard .
<person> .
but , after we finished . you woulda never even known . we took all that away . made it right .
<person> , ever since you divorced your last husband , you ' ve been no fun . i ' m looking , and this guy pops my tarts .

<person> to me , mrs <person> . <person> very carefully . i do know what ' s best . as we ' re sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves . and this makes me very , very mad . it ' s why i came all the way up here . if everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school . i promise you that i will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job . <continued_utterance> who is responsible for this tragedy . then , in your name and the walkers ' name and the name of whoever decides to join us , i shall sue . i shall sue for negligence until they bleed .

is anything wrong ?
excuse my presumption , but i do not agree . as a teacher on a training mission , i am content to command a starship . if we are to go on actual duty , it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command .

but at the same time he ' s sending the signal to her --
so she feels . what he feels . while he ' s in her . the thrill while he ' s killing her . is sent to her , heightening her fear . which in turn heightens the turn on for him . i ' ve seen a lot , <person> .

i was going to remind you of nothing , least of all that which you know well . your mistake , if i may be so bold , was promotion . commanding a starship is your first best destiny . anything else is a waste of material .

the son ' a , the borg , the romulans , the evil <person> and that pesky nexus . you seem to get all the easy assignments !
i ' ve seen this <person> practice . his style is more longboard , and this is a shortboard wave , but he ' s still pretty good . i could lose you know .
hi <person> !
yes . beautiful women . in thongs .
<person> . what else do you see , feel , taste .
are you sure ?
yeah .
<person> . what ' s out there isn ' t alien . it ' s an animal .
maybe so . but i think we need to ask <person> about it .
it ' s right over the next ridge . only two guards .
you are now prisoners of the blue team .
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel ?
no .
<person> ! it ' s <person> .
. and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles , further and further down . then i ' ll pull off your panties with my teeth .
well you ' re telling your teachers and your friends --
<person> hysteria .
i guess you ' d have to guess . not having been there with them . having to guess whether your husband ' s report was word for word accurate .
<person> never lied .
no , i don ' t care about you -- you ' re fantastic . my whole interest , if it ' s not too late , is in <person> . and how to undo what you ' ve done to her .
and what have i done to her , besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ? sidney , you were right -- the boy ' s a dilly .
hi . this is <person> . leaves a message .
i just got out of a six-year relationship . <person> ? that should help to explain why i ' m acting so weird . it ' s not you . it ' s me . i just wanted to say that . <person> . this is <person> . he dials again . there ' s no turning back .
the flashback in the courtroom , when she tells about being a school teacher .
i had a teacher like that once .
<person> square for belvedere , ohio , where the bimmel girl was abducted . <person> triangle where her body was found - down here in missouri . <person> marks for the other four girls , in different colors . this new one , today . washed up here . <person> , in west virginia , about six miles below u . s . <number> . real boonies .
there ' s no correlation at all between where they ' re kidnapped and where they ' re found . ? what if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites ? do they converge at all ?
yeh , he croaked <person> . what else do i got ta know . <continued_utterance> aw right , he runs the numbers outta the south side .
and a packing company , a chain of savings and loans and half the politicians in chicago and new york . there ain ' t a fix in the world gon na cool him out if he blows on ya .
oh , so we understand , don ' t we , <person> ? he had no choice .
i ' m just trying to help .
how stupid you were to be caring about a loser like me . i agree with you wholeheartedly .
you have a lot of talent , <person> .
there was a man , poet -- a theatre poet , i heard -- does he come to the house ?
a theatre poet ?
it was mr . harolday ' s orders . <continued_utterance> why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him , little one . -- he is not for you .
be quiet .
you don ' t look nothing like your pictures . what happened to the curly red hair ?
grandma and <person> sent you pictures of a neighbor girl . they didn ' t want you to break out and come kidnap me .
the deal was you bought it how you saw it . <continued_utterance> look , i have helped ya as much as i am gon na help ya . you still got a car and i suggest you use it before you ' re not welcome anymore .
hey .
that ' s right . my second question i got ta ask , so we get our bearings here . have you ever jacket in ?
no .
what ?
you ' re a ringer . she brought you in to replace me . out with the old .
never seen it . <person> ' t know much about this mentor thing . how ' s it work ?
generally , you , as mentor , draw on some personal religious philosophy to first intimidate , and then later inspire me .
theo , how would you like to be my new partner ?
you already have a partner mr . <person> . <person> walks over as the sleazeballs ' car pulls out of the driveway .
yeah , i ' ll call him . but i don ' t think he ' s got a fuckin ' clue in life .
how about my cousin <person> ?
does this mean i can ' t take a shower ?
no . it should be dry by now .
<person> , i got this friend .
friend ? yeah , we all got friends , <person> . i ' m warning you , <person> away from this one . back off , italian boy . you ' re getting too close to this one .
where would you find old pictures of me ?
at work .
. the remington <number> autoloader .
anything else ?
it ' s unlikely that anyone will go to prison , mrs . <person> . but he or his company will pay in other ways . and we must make them pay . not for the money or to compensate you for the loss of your son . that can ' t be done . but to protect other innocent children . you see , i ' m not just here to speak for your anger , but for the future as well . what we ' re talking about is an ongoing relationship to time .
i didn ' t ask if you wanted milk .
what do ya mean ?
you know , somebody tailin ' ya . a torpedo or somethin ' .
i ' m sorry about that , mr . <person> .
what is it ?
do you understand why i came here ?
i think so . i tried to get into your cab one night , and now you want to come and take me away .
you ' re not much with girls , are you ?
well , iris , i look at it this way . a lot of girls come into my cab , some of them very beautiful . and i figure all day long men have been after them : trying to touch them , talk to them , ask them out . and they hate it . so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all . so i don ' t say a thing . i pretend i ' m not even there . i figure they ' ll understand that and appreciate me for it . it takes iris a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking : i am loved to the extent i do not exist .
who programmed you ? <continued_utterance> you ' re in trouble , pal . big trouble . but if you tell us who put you up to it , you could make it easy on yourself . come on , who ' s your user ?

your handwriting - nothing more naked . <person> - nothing ' s quite touching the line - that ' s vanity .
how do you deal with it ? all the misery and pain and violence .
i can stop monsters , <person> . and because i can , i have to .

erect . you know , a `` boner ? '' i ' d heard that it gives you a boner , to shoot a man .

i held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital . i couldn ' t stop crying . we need to go into the basement now . <continued_utterance> you know what your uncle <person> did right after the doctor put his arm back in place ? he jumped off the table and gave me a hug . he had already forgotten that i was the one who hurt him .
we won ' t be able to get out of there .
we ' re american citizens , twenty years . ten years in the bureau -- they knocked her down . and took him . out of my own house .

you could have just said you didn ' t remember .
hi . <person> . you okay ? you look as if you ' ve seen a ghost .
<person> was at the opera last night .
well , maybe these men won ' t think so . we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up . it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat . i happened to look out the window and there was scott <person> with this green thing draped over his arm pulling <person> down the walk to the car .

the miracle kid .

it says number withheld .
less than a minute , we ' re never gon na make it .

<person> <number> or <number> . <person> i squeeze a few more hours in the morning . eighty miles a day , a hundred miles a night .

<person> , i didn ' t come back just to say good-bye . i shouldn ' t tell you this , but you ' re the only one i can trust . and if i don ' t come back , i want somebody to know .
once you enjoyed <person>s complexes .
thats before my analyst taught me that my enjoyment of them was a sign of my suppressed non- enjoymnent of them .
i found dad .
he ' s dead , isn ' t he . <person> might just as well have died before you were born .
well done , man . we ' ll see you after class .
did you tell that nimrod you ' re not going to room with him ?

<person> , okay . sure , norman .

erm . the soup of the day is tomato with basil oil and parmesan crostini . the special is marinated swordfish , tabbouleh and moroccan chermoula . it ' s really good . er , we ' re also serving a debragga and <person> with a side order of fries and the salad is snow pea and radish with a cider vinaigrette . can i start you off with a sparkling water ?
take your freedom . i can ' t live like this any more . it makes me feel worthless !
calm yourself down !
medical school . before i dropped out . i had a moment of clarity : in anatomy class i realized i ' d rather draw bodies than cut them up . and when i realized i couldn ' t make art , i decided to sell it .
some journey .
i didn ' t make the call .
why not ?
i take uh . uh . . . <person> . . .
uh-huh . . any thing else ?
nothing up there . the grass is matted down in a few places , but that could have been anything .
it was the husband . the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman .
that depends .
on what ?
it ' s <person> . hey you .
you guys having fun ?
no idea . <continued_utterance> it ' s a test pattern so far . <continued_utterance> <person> , a little bande action . <continued_utterance> hey , getting good . <person> suspense build .
what is it ?
<person> . you have the whole fleet at your disposal . they supported the coup , they ' ll follow you .
the scimitar will serve my needs .
how are you feeling ? are you comfortable ?
just do it .
what ?
for a drive . i don ' t know when we last went out .
i can ' t do that . if i tell them , they ' ll , if i tell them , they ' ll try <person> for rape , they ' ll .
but that ' s what happened .
i just checked `` downtown '' . <person> everywhere tonight .
incidentally , what happened to that doll ? - you gave me the item last night . still alive ?
why , thank you . <person> . i ' m having a show friday . you should come by and meet some good people .
who knows . where ' d you learn cpr ?
dr . <person> , the man we want was never your patient . it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence . <person> , <person> - time is eating us up . just show me the ones you ' ve turned away .
examination and interview materials are confidential . we ' ve never violated an applicant ' s trust , and we never will .
i love the fact you brought <person> with you and no clothes . <person> says you wash the same shirt out every night .
no ! i ' ve got more than one shirt !
you don ' t know shit . <person> suffering <person> and her poor suffering people . it ' s called `` going native '' -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it . she had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it . and now they ' re getting exactly what they want , which is the sheik will be back in the mix . but ten times as strong , because now he ' s the big man who stood up to the americans . i did what was necessary . i make no apologies . if you think you ' re going to be able to use that file against me , you know even less about politics than i imagined .
general . i ' m not in politics . you can have this back . i won ' t use it .
so i ' m not as tall as you expected ?
i always hoped i would hit two meters .
the officers will be very discreet . we won ' t interfere with your thing .
with my thing . will you be mingling ?
someone ?
a girl . you know .
<person> - he ' s going to help you ! you want to lose your job ?
a girl needs a little romancing before she -
maybe you could back off just a little bit --
what did you do ?
what do you mean ?
you mentioned that he had a learning disability .
it ' s one of these . for some reason , cool bars in l . a . have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front .
that doesn ' t sound too good for business .
are you finished ?
he starts this - buzzing in me , in my head . he makes me feel violated . you used me , mr . <person> .
no , man . i know you didn ' t get it ' cause you wouldn ' t ' ve asked me . it wasn ' t that funny anyway .
. piece of shit . <person> , <person> , this is my friend rob from <person> . <person> .
. so i cut off my power , shut down the afterburners and came in low on <person> ' s trail . i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments . as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad . <person> was pretty upset . he grounded me for the rest of the season . you should have been there . it was fantastic .
you ought to take it easy <person> . you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley , but those little skyhoppers are dangerous . keep it up , and one day , whammo , you ' re going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall .
people throw stones . they call me names . i mean , really .
really .
wrestling .
i went after the kid . you still want that parker guy ' s data , don ' t you ?
<person> ! ! he isn ' t my boyfriend ! he ' s a jedi assigned by the senate to protect me .
a bodyguard ? ! oh , <person> ! they didn ' t tell us it was that serious !
alright , gentlemen , if you ' ll just please make yourselves at home .
thank you .
why ?
because they gots a window with a dogs in it . you want me to `` push in . `` or can i lose the shot .
so before he died he got his paychecks , paid his taxes . <person> sporting goods stores . and had long spending gaps where he was enjoying the great outdoors . that pattern continues a year after his death . he gets some paychecks . rents an apartment . buys a three thousand dollar kayak . pays his taxes . <person> and buried and still paying his taxes . then everything stops . last visa charge was to travelocity for a plane ticket to mexico city .
<person> men don ' t pay their bills .
how ' s business ?
yeah it ' s good , mate , thriving .
miranda -- you ' re a lawyer . you can argue both sides of any case -- but , why we feel what we feel -- isn ' t logical . it ' s emotional . <person> , <person> -- i ' m afraid you ' re going to have to make this decision based on your emotions .
well , then -- i ' m screwed . i don ' t know what i feel .
rephrase . do you agree that he might tie up to the defendant ' s bo .
so why ' s the d- <number> in <person> ' s well ?
if we can just avoid any more female advice , we ought to be able to get out of here .
well , let ' s get moving !
hoo-whee ! <person> ' s gettin ' worse !
never mind , i said ! just keep going !
no . could be . but i think we need to get you to a neurologist . nothing urgent .
a neurologist ?
hi , <person> . can you move your car , please ?
why ?
i want to gamble .
here are two quarters . when you lose these , you ' re not going to get anymore .
but if he knew we have so little time -
if we act too anxious , he ' ll make us wait . he ' ll let the senator keep hoping , day after day , until <person> finally washes up . that ' d be the most fun of all .
how mr . <person> ?
you need a sponsor ; i have influence . i could sponsor you .
hi , hooker , you gettin ' married or somethin ' ?
come into a little dough . you wan na get outa here tonight ?
anything .
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance ? i can do that ?
what are you still doing here ?
you remember opening the door ?
did you think the play sucked big time ?

yes !
no i ' m not !
it ' s just me . i want to talk to you . let me in .
you put me life in danger .
i do not understand .
i know . <continued_utterance> do you know anything about <person> ' s plans against the federation ?
you believe me , right ? <continued_utterance> dr . <person> , you believe my secret , right ?
i don ' t know how to answer that .
<person> , ' cause i ' m not mad at you anymore either .
that ' s a relief . since i did come all the way to france and everything . and .
hi , babe .
' member ray slater ? he was the guy i was goin ' with before i met you ?
well , you look old enough to be a guard .
<person> <number> . i get my license in september .
you fucking know that . back to mine . bit of munch . couple of <person> ' s .
you getting changed ?
but he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested .
if he had no idea , why did the jews need saving ? this is the question , <person> , to all germans : <person> did the jews need saving in this country ? <person> , if people had no idea ?
it was worth it . but i didn ' t deserve the tour in hell . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t ever go to military school if you can help it . it sucks . i jumped the wall two days ago .
you going back ?
<person> usually just sends those to the national media . the local press doesn ' t know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway .
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program . push the issues .
i guess <person> wants it .
<person> . you ladies choose .
what ' s going to happen ?
i have to be smart here . i mean , we ' re not married and i ' d have no legal rights to . this home that i built . with you .
oh no . i couldn ' t let it out of my house . you ' ll have to finish it here .
it ' s getting kind of late --
but maybe one day , she ' ll put the bitterness behind her and find a new love .
<person> ' t be daft . she ' s old , you big sop . a parked <number> x <number> looms out of the mist .
<person> . now we ' re getting somewhere .
and she likes <person> .
i got married because <person> said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
you look so pale , dear . are you out of vitamins ?
i bought a bottle of them yesterday . <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
that ' s why he won ' t know it .
i ' m not sure i know it .
she said we ' re getting remarried ?
only a fire drill . my concern is that <person> seems apathetic towards her work knowing she ' s leaving before the end of the semester .
i don ' t know , what ? thirty , <person> maybe .
<person> ' t give me that shit . you know exactly how much you lost . what ' d you drop ?
<person> ' t flatter yourself . i take pictures of a lot of junk . <continued_utterance> <person> , let ' s hear it . i ' m sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house .
we ' re trying to repair <person> ' s ship . it ' s been damaged and --
i heard ! i heard !
<person> , three fifty-five , three --

i ' ve got a little challenge for you , <person> -- a new recruit . he ' s a tough case , but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games . let him hope for a while . and blow him away .
this must be it .
how serious is the damage ?
-- some people just can not live in the camps . for my brother , it was already like dying . the only thing he lives for is movies . <continued_utterance> -- and then some sheik tells him that , to die for <person> is beautiful . if he does this thing , our parents will be taken care of , and he will live on in paradise with seventy virgins . <person> . and my brother , he needs to believe it very much , so he straps ten sticks of dynamite to his chest and goes to the movies . and i become a vip . it is very confusing .
-- so who are you afraid of betraying ? you know these people . they bomb , they maim . do they represent the palestine you want to build ? they ' re using you .
you think that will last ?
it ' s already gone .
<person> if you want it , why don ' t you make me an offer ?
because sadly i ' m still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land .
i lied to <person> . i ' ll need some kind of peace offering . can i get the drawings from his cell ?
good idea . meantime , try to get a feel for <person> . her apartment , her friends . how he might ' ve stalked her . i ' m going to the other two clinics , <person> and ohio . <person> ' s the hardest part , starling . use your anger , don ' t let it keep you from thinking . just keep your eyes on catherine . we ' ve got less than <number> hours .
. last march in iraq , we identified the man we believe responsible for bombing the army barracks last year . in august , he went to lebanon . where he was . extracted .
extracted ? extracted by whom ? i see .
truck drivers bring up harlem specials that blow up in your hand . but this guy don ' t deal no shit . just quality . if you ever need anything , i can put you in touch .
for a fee .
we don ' t need one .
how are we gon na get about with two kids .
i ' m pissing you off ? i ' m doing what i said i ' d do . what the hell are you doing ?
my word is good , and it ' ll always be good . when did i ever give my word to you ?
it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi . not being able to visit the places you like . or do the things you like .
or be with the people i love .
his whole name ?
okay , not his entire name . <person> ?
dammit , <person> , you made me late .
what ' s his name ?
maybe . <person> yourself .
how ' s that working out , by the way ?
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more , then i shall be the sorrier . <continued_utterance> the queen commands a comedy , <person> for <person> .
<person> is not here .
he quit ?
i ' d better press your evening clothes , sir . you have not for- gotten <person> ' s new year ' s party .
no , i haven ' t . i suppose all the waxworks are coming ?
you are saying goodbye , aren ' t you . ?
he reacts vigorously , protesting : <continued_utterance> that ' s fish four days old . ! i can ' t buy it , <person> ! right out of that mouth i love , like you ' re a ventriloquist ' s dummy , your brother is saying goodbye ! gee ! . you want me to be honest , don ' t you ? !
no , he ' s totally too young for me . but we ' re just having dinner . it ' s not a date .
does he know that ?
they ' re my dad ' s . the lenses hurt my eyes .
i knew there was a sound explanation . <continued_utterance> what was that you were saying before with your soldiers ? day pro fun .
would you like that ?
you should hand-wash that blouse , and send somebody out for some things . i look good in reds , purples , hot pink -- and shoes . five-inch heels . fuck-me pumps . oh , man -- sorry . ' scuse my mouth .
we did this job a while back . this woman .
my mom . <continued_utterance> my mom is dead .
as much as we care for him , <person> . we have to remember that <person> isn ' t capable of disappointment .
i don ' t believe that , sir . we ' ve shared many disappointing journeys .
<person> , what is it ? there ' s something you ' re not telling me .
<person> has been murdered .
this is how it starts . next thing you know . we ' re only having sex three or four times a week .
most people consider that normal .
yes .
about conflict .
wish i ' d slept last night .
i ' m fucked .
am i here as revenge on your ex ?
i don ' t know why you ' re here . why are you here , <person> ?
back off <person> . what kind of cunt would turn up here if they knew what had happened ? leave my business to me boy . <continued_utterance> i got a message that he wanted me to fuck you two off , that ' s why i wanted you back . i ' l l do the fight before he causes any more carnage , but i ' l l only do it if you ' re there .
why ?
do you remember when you first got here ? we used to talk all night long . until the sun came up . we would just lie in bed and talk .
that ' s because i wanted to fuck you , dumbass ! now hows aboot you get those pants down !
so that gives you something .
it gives me . i don ' t know . maybe two hundred people who i know wear .
i know she liked me . i mean , it ' s not like i wanted to do anything with her tonight .
<person> for you , man . he ' s being smart .
you must be so pleased , i followed your jellybean trail right here , like a good little chump .
you got froggy on me a couple times . <continued_utterance> i thought that riff about the death squad was pretty good . i hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it .
me too .
you think you look so handsome in mine ?
where did you stop last ?
stay right there .
i know . it ' s like the opposite of inbreeding . the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool .
<person> at its best .
say , arly -- about that poker game , night before last , i -- -
forget it .
c ' mon , <person> -- that report ' s like the blind leading the blind .
because when we get down there --
bridge to commander <person> .
<person> here .
well , thank you . they ' re actually uniforms - we ' re cheerleaders .
mmm-hmm . y ' sure are .
the thing is , that ' s not me .
give me a little credit .
<person> , <person> , if i ' m supposed to ever be this great leader , you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while . ' cause if you won ' t , nobody else will .
was there a problem ?
you saw that on t . v . , cole ?
everybody got upset . they had a meeting . <person> started crying . i don ' t draw like that anymore .
me ? what happened to you ?
i been looking for you for weeks .
oh , i ' m waiting on some news , that ' s all . say . can i ask you why you never asked me something you probably asked <person> anyway ?
you can try .
yes , <person> ?
i thought you decided to stay .
what does he do ?
he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , they send him to the nut-hut for a while .
no . no . a spider .
<person> , did you at least talk to her ?
she should ' ve known better .
she put a razor to her wrists a day later .
then i am a collage of unaccounted-for brush strokes . i an all random . ouisa stands up from the dinner table . her chair scrapes . there is an embarrassed rush . mrs . bannister sit down . ouisa leaves the dinner table .
what kind of behavior is -
i am so sorry , <person> .
you got away . i didn ' t . that is all . no , no tears . tears mock me all the more .
i ' ve got to run along . thanks any- way for your interest in my career .
it ' s not your career -- it ' s mine . i kind of hoped to get in on this deal . i don ' t want to be a reader all my life . i want to write .
you ' re a scumbag .
i ' m a live scumbag .
<person> ! so , you ' re the man who rings me up every single day of my life with special offers , huh ?
no , actually , i ' m an assistant .
<person> --
to be on the safe side . i mean --
and i ' m <person> . what exactly do you people want with my bus .
we ' re all on the same team here , agent <person>bard .
bear with me . your sketch book . is there a drawing of me in there ?
i ' m not sure .
played a mean harmonica as a younger man . lost my taste for it . <person> ' t make much sense on the inside .
here ' s where it makes most sense . we need it so we don ' t forget .
you ' re sure you ' re not chasing your own tail , though ?
what do you know about <person> ?
who the fuck ' s she ?
i seen her up at stonefield . she ' s got a nose made of plastic .
i ' m working a single now , which means stretch-shifts , six to six , sometimes six to eight in the a . m . , six days a week . <continued_utterance> it ' s a hustle , but it keeps me busy . i can take in three to three-fifty a week , more with skims . <continued_utterance> why should it be grounded ?
<person> - i mean i just saw the needle of the empire state building .
no . no , i haven ' t .
wow . now why do you think that is ?
you are lying , you never lost that kid for <number> <continued_utterance> <person> never mentioned it .
he only remembers i

<person> ' t ruin this holiday for me . <continued_utterance> are you still there ?
hey , you -- <person> -- whatever -your- name-is -- what are my things doing here ? <continued_utterance> i ' m talking to you . my clothes and things are up in the room .

<person> , <person> , <person> .
no . you don ' t have to pay . i ' m sorry . <person> ' t worry , please .
no . i ' m kidding . instead of a platter -- i ' ll just build a sea glass building and serve fish inside . <person> , cristina . why don ' t you count it and .
how do we find him ?
we ' ll trap him . i ' ll release it to the papers . i can call the new york times . i have friends . they ' ll publish the story . <person> will see it . and turn him in . we ' ll find <person> .
of course . i ' m a terminator .
<person> to me , very carefully , okay ? you ' re not a terminator any more . <person> ? you got that ? you can ' t just go around killing people !
and if i don ' t join your rebellion , i assume this jedi with me will also die ?
i don ' t wish to make you to join our cause against your will , senator , but you are a rational , honest representative of your people and i assume you want to do what ' s in their best interest . <person> ' t you fed up with the corruption , the bureaucrats , the hypocrisy of it all ? . <person> ' t you ? be honest , senator .
that ' s just plain silly . your self- esteem is just low because she ' s with someone else . but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad . it ' s no good , man . you got ta get out there . the ladies want to love you , baby .
i just need some time .
-- or i used to be .
<person> to me .
poker .
<person> . about this suggestion of you working for me .
i was in space for a long time . then a ship belonging to the `` talosians '' picked me up . they asked me where i came from . i told them people called the `` pakleds '' took me from my homeworld . they are fat . <person> groans . time passes . <continued_utterance> then i opened my eyes and saw you .
do you know who i am ?
you ' re afraid of the dark , sergeant caine ?
no , sir . but the manual says --
yeh , i guess i shoulda had the meat loaf .
it isn ' t any better .

ask a question . get an atlas .
all i know is that we must respond .
you should have your own place .

the force ?
well , the force is what gives a <person> his power . it ' s an energy field created by all living things . it surrounds us and penetrates us . it binds the galaxy together . <continued_utterance> now , let ' s see if we can ' t figure out what you are , my little friend . and where you come from .
what do we do now ?
the show must you know
according to my information , it should be in this quadrant somewhere . just south of the rishi maze .
no co-ordinates ? it sounds like the kind of directions you ' d get from a street tout . some old miner or furbog trader .
just imagine if girls weren ' t weirded out by our boners and they actually wanted to see `em , like this shit .
you know it ' s been , like , a year and a half since i ' ve seen an actual human female nipple . besides my mom ' s . i saw it last month , and it was sick .
he ' s dead . he looks dead , i guess .
probably wasn ' t him then .
thanks for watching her while i went to the doctor .
sure . everything okay ?
the drummer ?
he ' s not just the drummer . he writes the lyrics ; it ' s his band . he ' s the fucking genius , not <person> or any of these wankers . it ' s <person> .
and i could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out . you are staying . <person> , <person> and the twins are picking us up at <number> : <number> to go to brunch at the sheraton . they do a magnificent job there . <person> is so excited you ' re coming .

you saw him and that ' s enough . <person> ' t stop living your life . you ' ll be protected by armed officers twenty-four seven .
until he ' s caught ?
<person> .
you talk to any reporters ? any press ?
then they should be made to .
by whom ? who ' s going to make them ?
did you ever think you would see the day when thousands of people were wearing your son <person> on t-shirts ?
no i didn ' t . but if any of you would like one they ' re <number> . <number> . available in blue or white .
i like them to look just right .
did i file them too short ?
you ' re lying .
i lost him . i was panicked .
i know .
he wasn ' t even wrong for you , like cosmically wrong , so don ' t beat up on yourself for wasting . however long it was .
we move in together - you slowly on the .
i ' m taking him now !
<person> , and . well , <person> and i decided to get married .

he ' s a man with a hole in his face <person> . who cares who he is ?
<person> well , let ' s wrap him up .
how long until they can send a message ?
about seven or eight minutes .
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?
we can ' t go down there . we ' re not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , <person> . we ' re just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
<person> . <person> ' to find the file and erase it . once that ' s gone , ain ' t nothin ' can stop him . just <person> and his <person> , runnin ' things from on high .
<person> ' t even say that . you ' ve got to find that file before he does .
no , i don ' t mind . i ' m busy too .
<person> ! we ' re all off to utica , so excuse me , mr . frannis-on-the- portisan . <person> moves toward the doorway onto the corridor . the chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth .
i am making <person> sushi . <person> for reaction .
wow . do you make sushi ?
we build the fire hut ? <continued_utterance> we have to lose the window .

i ' m on it . <continued_utterance> the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating . i don ' t think <person> built this thing for comfort .
speed -- two hundred , seventy-five thousand kilometers per second .
germans .
you ' re just like my father .
<person> ?
<person> .
quiet as a tomb . i don ' t like just waiting here for something to happen to her .
what ' s going on ?
yes . it felt like <person> .
he ' s still looking for that old file .
we ' ve never interrupted <person> in mid run . we ' d have to literally pull the plug . it could damage the processors .
let it finish , then . no harm in that , i guess . <continued_utterance> all of you are in deep shit , i promise you . as for <person> , he ' ll never make it off this base .
thank you , commander . <continued_utterance> <person> . prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals . they don ' t know our procedures so just . open the doors .

hey , <person> , <person> . whoa . time out .

did he have a wife ? did he had a girl friend ? did you know them ?
<person> , i ' m .

i heard she had breast-reduction surgery . her tits must be crazy perfect now .
of course you do . if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people . you ' d be sitting where i am now . at least i hope you would .

all three , i heard . <person> as well . back with the wife . she ' s pregnant again .
you mean for you . a <number> -year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it ' s best for her if every- one pretends it didn ' t happen ? this isn ' t going to work out .
you ' re damn right . i ' m gon na sick of your imperious bullshit . i never said i was <person> . if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a <number> hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead ! i have a life !

<person> , what did <person> fazeli ever do for you ?
i know , but we can ' t quite figure out how to , y ' know , do it .

<person> ! the hostess with the most-est ! the woman of the hour ! <continued_utterance> this party ' s blowin ' my ass off ! i want you to have a drink with me .
no , thanks . i ' m good . but , seriously , thanks for getting all the drinks . it really made the night .
<person> ' t play games with me , <person> . you weren ' t on any mercy mission this time . you passed directly through a restricted system . several transmissions were beamed to this ship by <person> spies . i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you .

a note ? that ' s a little chilly .
i ' m embarrassed . i just haven ' t been myself lately . what can i say ?
mate , are you alright ?

i ' ll be right up , darling . <continued_utterance> you have kids ? they ' re great . sometimes you just want to . drug them .
what do you mean , let the justice system do its work .

<person> out my heart ! throw my liver to the dogs !
what ' s this then ?
it was my father ' s , sir .
aah , i ' m fine . little hung over is all .
how did you do that , <person> ?
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates ?
nobody in this town really understands <person> . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually , he ' s the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .
anywhere . we ' ll talk about it in the car . <continued_utterance> hand me that box of tapes , will you ?
what is it ?
you ' re just paranoid from the coke . you know sometimes i think you just make up these dramas to test me or something .
that ' s very interesting , let ' s stay up all night like the old days and discuss it .
where ' d you get the tie ?
bought it .
well . i don ' t know .
three . how much money you got in your pocket ?
<person> ? where are you ? it ' s over . i found him .
who are you talking to ?
i don ' t sleep well , anymore .
because of your mother ?

just a minute , mr . <person> . i think . <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry . i thought that was mr . <person> returning . yes , i ' ll tell him when he comes in . i know he ' s been trying to reach you . <continued_utterance> that ' s the third time he ' s called today .
he wants me to break a leg ?
`` the love letters of great men . `` volume one .
am i in there ?
no .
well , i ' m very , very disappointed to hear that . it makes me feel like a fool .
i am not so well-born .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . <person> was looking at you tonight .
yes , <person> , what is it ?
we haven ' t been issued weapons , sir .
no , man , we ' re in the play-offs .
i ' ll make gretsky bleed , the little bitch .
and it ' s so hard to kill the little fuckers .
tell me about it . you pour industrial bleach right on `em . nothing .
what ?
nothing . it was my attempt at humour .
this is the right day .
did she read the script ?
thank you , parents . <continued_utterance> the machinery of the new ' v-chip ' is very simple , and similar to that of the v- chip . the chip is placed just under the subject ' s skin , where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered . the parents are fascinated .
<person> wait a minute , are you telling us that this chip somehow knows if the kid is swearing ?
<person> , really , i don ' t know .
you don ' t have to know . i know enough for both of us . change in there .
to <person> !
another one , but to you , man ! everyone , to this guy ! who the fuck are you , man ?

uh . maybe ?
yeah , i mean , yeah . oh , i wanted to ask you , how old are kids when they start to write ?

<person> . the man you want to volunteer to help elect president .
no . no i don ' t .
i ' m not crazy .
i ' ll make us some coffee , get you your pills , whip us up some french toast , i have , the best maple syrup ever . '
<person> . you are a woman to love .
hanging out at the beach surfing with your friends is not my idea of something <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number> to do . this way you ' ll make some money and meet people here . you ' d best get used to it . this is where we live now .
all thanks to dad and his secretary .
it ' s silly , really . i mean , i ' d seen him at the office , obviously i ' d seen him , he ' s the associate publisher , and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place , and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat , which of course he was allergic to , and i got his lettuce and tomato on white .
how amazing .
we better make it , or sport ' ll get mad . how do you want to make it ?
i don ' t want to make it . i came here to get you out .
you fought in the clone wars ?
yes , i was once a <person> knight the same as your father .
ideally , i ' d like to make it into fiction before i ' m thirty .
and then maybe a swimwear collection , a chat show , a pasta sauce range ?
i don ' t know if they understand .
<person> , is there anything you want to say to me ? that i can tell my people here ?
there was a man smoking a pipe . i saw him on the monitor . who ' s he ?
the man with the pipe isn ' t here right now .
wow . look , this is our dormitory . i can get to my room . hey , wait a minute .
<person> ?
what happened ?
bumped his head .
but your voice have they dropped ?
no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away .
and you said .
what else ? keep on keepin ' on . <continued_utterance> she has to stick with it . have the patience , the guts , to ignore the pain . you disagree ?
then excuse me , because if i had the equipment i ' d inject the vodka .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> it is very good that you did not ask , `` why ? ''
your new chair , sir .
it ' s the <person> , captain . state-of-the-art ergonomics .
that ' s something i can not relate to . as a protocol droid , i ' m either active or inactive .
i guess you ' re lucky .
uh , you can call me <person> .
i see , sir <person> .
i was scared of what you were gon na do .
when i found you ?
dead . <person> accident .
<person> , its for you .
no , it ' s about me .
am i in it ?
<person> ' t ever do that again .
i thought i saw a black widow spider . <person> looks at victoria , shrugs . back to jonah .
i accept that .
it ' s like . it ' s like this big pissed off god up in your face just screaming at you . so close you can smell the metal on his breath .
every moment in life is a learning experience or what good is it ? right ? right ?
well , yes .
it wouldn ' t have to be that way .
then we ' d be living a lie - one we couldn ' t keep even if we wanted to . mt sister saw it . so did my mother . i couldn ' t do that . could you , <person> ? could you live like that ?
i ' m afraid it is dr . <person> . because it ' s sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor . <continued_utterance> off the record , i don ' t mind telling you , this thing scares the shit out of me .
it doesn ' t make any sense .
yes , yes , captain -- thank you for coming .
nothing for me . i understand there ' s something urgent you need to discuss with me .
no . but it feels right . my first novel ' s definitely going to be autobiographical .
your first novel ? you ' re going to dash one off just like that ?
crowded . i had to move to new york just to get some room . and where ' d i wind up ? a one bedroom apartment with three roommates .
aside from the space issue . why ' d you move to new york ?
this is the wrong key , <person> .
it isn't .
i know . <continued_utterance> she wanted me to tell you --
<person> , please stop .
then don ' t tell him .
<person> .
aye sir --
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you ' ve talked with mr . <person> .
oh , you want to get paid .
we can come back later if that ' s better .
you tell me .
do you fear them ?
<person> , that ' s a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i ' m going to try to remember that . <person> , humanity and justice . <person> . but you used the word ' naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics can ' t be separated ?
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they weren ' t kept separate i learned to my cost .
i ' m not so sure somebody hasn ' t tried already -- remember , when we stopped to change horses on the way over from <person> --
shore -- you told me how <person> and <person> tried to frame stan .
<person> . that ' s very good . <continued_utterance> what you ' re grown-up enough to know . is that people . can do <continued_utterance> when you ' re in trouble . have me there . when you fall in love . have me there . you can . <continued_utterance> that ' s how we go on , you know . forever . <person> someone takes us along . <continued_utterance> on your wedding night . when your babies are born . i want to be there . will you take me ?
always , always . always .
<person> . i know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over , but . what happened ?
i ' m gon na tell you , but when i do , just say nothing . <person> ' t judge me . just be my friend . <person> ?
<person> you .
<person> you , you cunt . you ' re just jealous cos you didn ' t think of it first . you ' re not that fucking smart .

so . she ignores this little kovitsky punk , takes the high moral ground . <continued_utterance> he ' s relentless . a major asshole .
no , i ' m off duty .
then how come your off duty light wasn ' t on . travis switches on the off duty light .
i can hear it now , it ' s gon na be the goddamned ' <person> ' .
i hate the press cases . especially the weird press cases . where you going ?
i ' m incapable of such an act , and so are you .
i think the facts speak for themselves . the same noble <person> blood runs in our veins . had you lived my life , you ' d be doing exactly as i am . look in the mirror , and see yourself . <continued_utterance> consider that , captain . i can think of no greater torment for you .
this is my way of . this is my way of asking you whether . <continued_utterance> oh man , once i ask it . give me a second . i ' m just trying to figure out whether there ' s any way to avoid knowing . no , damn there ' s not . <person> , you ' re on . real short answer , huh ? have you had sex with another .
i know you ' re very angry ?
this scene is why i ' m doing the movie . `` look at the mill , frank -- look at the way it goes around . half of the time the darned wheel ' s under water , but . ``

what are you doing to counsellor troi ?
you ' re right . and there was a time when i wouldn ' t have hurt anyone . then the borg came . and they showed me that if there is one constant in this universe , it ' s death . afterwards , i began to realize that none of it mattered . we ' re all going to die anyway . it ' s only a question of how and when . you will too , captain . you might contract a fatal disease . you might die in battle . <continued_utterance> . or burn to death in a fire . <continued_utterance> you looked surprised . but you shouldn ' t be . i ' ve been to the nexus , captain . i know things about people . <person> ' t you beginning to feel time gaining on you ? it ' s like a predator . it ' s stalking you . you can try to outrun it with doctors . medicines . new technologies . but in the end , time is going to hunt you down . and make the kill .

she had an accident .

sometimes it ' s not enough !
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
<person> .
not the best place to stand , fella .
you ' ll go fluff and fold , someday . whereas i will still be writing obits . i can ' t even come up with a decent piece for the paper to show my editor .
i can ' t help you with your writer ' s block -- until i see that look in dale biberman ' s eyes . the look that says she knows i ' m the one for her .

you don ' t know shit . <person> suffering <person> and her poor suffering people . it ' s called `` going native '' -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it . she had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it . and now they ' re getting exactly what they want , which is the sheik will be back in the mix . but ten times as strong , because now he ' s the big man who stood up to the americans . i did what was necessary . i make no apologies . if you think you ' re going to be able to use that file against me , you know even less about politics than i imagined .
<person> . here ' s <person> .

i said , why would you ?
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?

who was he ?
i don ' t know .
what ' s wrong with <person> ?

counselor ?
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle : me .
now , you look here --
you ' re the one who better start lookin ' -- lookin ' for a way out for killin ' red <person> .
there are no other guests . we don ' t want to share this night with other people . this is for you and me .
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to <person> , all by himself . he was afraid of catching cold .
anything it samples by physical contact .
like it could disguise itself as anything . a pack of cigarettes ?
<person> , i seriously doubt that mr . <person> ever said- ' eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker ' in school ! the boys all laugh .
oh , oh .
no , that ' s true .
no . you , i told them , you can ' t betray with the picture what you ' re saying with the words . and , i don ' t know , the movies , i don ' t know . they should be socially uplifting , why does she have to show her br . what is this . ?
i want to have a wedding . with you .
no .
s-ssssstop it !
stuttering --
that . and she won ' t want the story printed in the paper .
well . i don ' t wan na forgive her .
now we wait for your mom to piss off and steal your parents ' booze like your brother always does . take a bit from every bottle . <person> of cake . it ' s not exactly what <person> wanted , but it ' ll do , right ?
come on ! just wear what you wore to school .
shhh . i ' m teaching <person> to read .
is he learnin ' ?
you want some lemonade ? take some lemonade . <continued_utterance> florrrrr .
sublime .
you see , <person> , that ' s why i didn ' t want you to know anything about this . i wanted to protect all of you -- your father , <person> . and now that you know , you ' re acting guilty , too .
oh , if we could only talk to father or someone about it .
and , now , what ' s <person> . ?
. when we get to dubai , better .
so they ' ll just keep coming until we release him .
unless we match their commitment with our own .
get somebody to come and stop that thing !
i ' ll handle it .
nuh-uh , flor you are not pinning this one on me . i ' ve got to finish packing up .
i just don ' t . out of space this school wants her to go for free ?
<person> ' t much ? can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our american soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine ? it ' s impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble army colonel .
well , i suppose when you put it that way .
i don ' t know . <person> , games are fun . but head games are dangerous .
then keep your head out of it .
when you ' re new to the force , like i am-
only six months in . i got two and a half years under my belt .
i know ! i ' m sorry i didn ' t mean for it to happen ! and i was the one they were shooting at !
<person> , i have given you every opportunity . to change . to make a decent life for yourself .
it is . a lotta people know . unfortunately , the easiest people to convince , the believer types , they also tend to be the dumbest . and people who demand proof -- well , this isn ' t something we can control , it comes when it comes , so if you can ' t make it happen , how can you prove it ? it ' s like that singing frog in the cartoon , but when the guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk . <person> laughs , horribly . he likes that cartoon . neil some of us try anyway . i say who needs that kind of aggravation ?
this all started when i was hypnotized . is that how it always is ?
you golf ?
me ? no , i think it ' s kind of a stupid game . i mean , at least , i could never get into it . i tried it once .
<person> ' t no second chances in life .
zat true ?
another little problem .
what do we do now ?
to see mr . de <person> . open the gate .
mr . de<person> is shooting . you got an appointment ?
you know about signs <person> ? not like the ones people write on . it ' s like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it . then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled . they ' re things that happen by chance or luck , but make you feel that someone ' s watching out for you .
i once had a bad dream and i couldn ' t wake up . i kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and i woke up . it was a picture of mom . she was smiling . it made me feel safe . you mean like that ?
what ? his car doesn ' t have headlights ?
good night .
is that your entire frame of reference for relationship problems ?
no . i don ' t know . it ' s a stressful time . our shows . the whole health thing .
no dog .
i saw you with a dog , in my mind .
hello .
you looking for some action ?
they ' d never hear me over that . <person> ' s get this over with .
me first .
but <person> has contacts all over the place ! this is <person> ! they ' ll be looking for me !
everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent . nobody knows you ' re here but me . we ' re trying to get a quick court date . a month , maybe two , tops . i ' ll spring you as soon as i can .
i ' m fine . i ' m clear . i just didn ' t think this could wait . <person> , this guy is trying to point us at something . <person> ' s part of it . but the other two don ' t connect .
did you drive here ?
hey ! who are you guys ? what ' s the story around here ?
you want to watch those force fields . <continued_utterance> you ' ll be having plenty of chances to get hurt , don ' t worry about that .
hm-hmm .
where i would sit on his feet and he ' d fly me through the air . i hit my head on the ceiling and i blacked out . <continued_utterance> i was knocked out for <number> - <number> minutes .
i thought you hadn ' t been to uk .
oh , i haven ' t . and it ' s not leeds , because that ' s <person> , kirkgate market , commercial street , <person> ' s-
but sir , i think it ' s imperative . i think the messages , the animals we ' ve seen , what killed <person> , the reading you got earlier -- i think they ' re all related .
<person> isn ' t hostile , norman . he said earlier -- we were his friends --
french toast .
<person> . this is scrambled . <person> .
what for , <person> ?
we have a warrant . to search your boat .
as in the textile <person>s . trying to shrug off the dress . i travel under my mother ' s name , too .
<person> .
i ' m just on my way out , bubbee .
well , i was just gon na drive into the city with <person> but if you ' re driving back , i ' d much rather go with you .
you got kids ?
who me ? nah , i ' d just fuck them up . that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids .
<person> .
hi . well , nice to see you guys here . <person> , <person> .
that ' s what my nephew keeps asking me . `` why you with the man , <person> ? ''
. well ? what ' d you tell him ?
who is that ?
that ' s my .
<person> , i want you in here . now . <person> focuses on the screen , staring . on the screen -- blank . <person> concentrating , on the screen .
<person> , are you there ?
. <person> ' t explain .
how long you going away for ?
i said ' excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .
you were . overjoyed yourself , to hear the news ?
<person> reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago . that ' s why micom wants onsite assessment .
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed .
it ' s getting kind of late --
are you married , mr . -- ?
<person> , models , strip dancers , escort girls , blue movies .
oops . sorry , wrong card .
did you send that <person> to table- top ?
i did .
she never gave me a tape .
<person> back about what she said .
