a klingon honeymoon begins with the kholamar desert march where the couple bonds in endurance trials . if they survive the challenge they move on to the fire caves of fek ' lhr to face the demons of gre ' thor .

well . i ' m sort of working with <person> and he suggested we kind of keep it between us . he thinks that my theory is . well , i don ' t know .
the scoundrel . i want to see that data , <person> !
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the . original , the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness .
followed by non-human manifestations .
so you ' re saying . you sleep around ?
only professionally .
what happens if i don ' t want to assume this woman ' s identity and raise my babies with a serial killer ?
<person> , don ' t be morbid . if anyone can deal with this , you can . i know you felt what i felt . it ' s real .
i know . i don ' t always do exactly what i ' m told . so i said , ' do you enjoy watching me ? ' and you said -- come on <person> .
i said , ' yeah . i ' d even do it for free . '

the bit where <person> finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy ' s daughter . <continued_utterance> you describe her light smattering of freckles and her striking profile . so . she turns her head . <continued_utterance> who did you base her on ?
well , no one ' s out there , but officially these are `` hostile zones . `` therefore you ' d be within your rights to classify anyone as `` hostile , '' i think . but i repeat , you should be worried about boredom , not action . any other questions before i go ?
down there . is it snowing ?
that ' s crap , son . he ' s proud of you . proud as a hen . we been friends a long time . i know him as good as anybody .
<person> fella , ain ' t he ?
nice meeting you , <person> .
you think my theory is okay , <person> ?
no , i ' m leaving in the morning .
then i guess i won ' t see you .
i bumped into him and i got so upset i started crying and then - my water broke .
he brought her to the hospital .
what ?
i love chocolate . i realized just yesterday how much i love it . i thought maybe , if they let you bring personal effects , you might have snuck some through , because . well , i ' ve been thinking about it .
come on guy , you know i only rib you because i love you so much !
if you love somebody then you treat them with respect ! you ' ve never respected me !
i ' m afraid the doctor is no longer aboard our ship .

<person> . because i want you to know . i really like fucking you . <continued_utterance> i like that too .
how could she not be real ? i can smell her , taste her . she does exactly what she did . it ' s not possible .
because she ' s confused . <person> ' t know why other people won ' t answer her . she only knows that you will . if she hasn ' t asked for something yet , she will . and once they ask , it ' s very difficult to stop yourself from doing it .
what do you mean ? she can , it can make me do something i don ' t want to do ?
<person> ? . is-is that you ?
i lost a little weight .
get the helium out of our bloodstream . we go to the surface now , we ' d pop like a soda bottle . <continued_utterance> maybe you should go . to the sub .

it ' s not that , <person> .
no . because the bus went off the road . and crashed .
you remember this ?
i told you , there ' s no --

' less you got hayfever .

<person> , that ' s him , that ' s the guy . you know what else the little creep did ? he kept files , close on <number> , <number> files . and you know what ' s in those files ?

<person> .
hi , how are you ? <person> .
i ' m not mad at you . <person> , i ' m not mad at you .

<person> . he ' s the ladies man . <continued_utterance> well , whatever the fuck it is , she used it . and then the spray perfume . you know , the real sweat kind - and , on top of that , get this , right when we ' re crossing the tri- boro bridge - she changes her pantyhose !

he is looking for <person> <number> i ' m sure .
<person> , think where one can find <person> ? where could he find sl <number> . ?

<person> , when i said i couldn ' t channel you . that didn ' t mean i wouldn ' t give my right arm to do just that . <continued_utterance> maybe i don ' t want to be looking over my shoulder . every day for twenty years . knowing someone else would have done it right . the way i can ' t .
trade you a smoke . for a secret . <continued_utterance> you know , i lost <person> awhile back ? in a supermarket .
well , let ' s go have some champagne , shall we ? toast all the newlyweds .

i ' ll remember , sergeant .
i ' m an attorney , if there ' s anything you have to say to .
. i have to give you this ticket for damage to city property . i ' m really sorry , <person> , it ' s a formality , i hope you ' ll excuse .
he just took care of it for me ; he was an ace . elegant . said our fate was to be friends . . oh my god . he was breaking up with me . he ' s a genius .
that ' s impossible , he wouldn ' t .
so i ' ll see you at the rehearsal .
yeah .
i am underground .
it could just as easily have been me in that box .
what ?
i need to talk to you about something . <continued_utterance> can we do it inside .
i ' m not worried . everything will be fine . the old team together . nothing can stop us . she turns and walks out of the shot . <person> stands for a second watching her , then turns to his assistant .
<person> . tell him to forget about her car . he can find another old car . i ' ll buy him five old cars , if necessary .
no , i ' m not . i ' m not !
<person> , take it easy . i ' ll trust your judgment - you don ' t have to protest with me . <continued_utterance> why are you trembling , dear . ?

what have you stopped here for ?
it ' s all right , you ' re safe .
. made us say -- lies . do . things . but we beat him . the captain and me . -- he thought he controlled us , but he didn ' t . the captain was strong .
we work organized crime sometimes , maybe a hit man wanted to lay low . he assumed the life of a civilian until things cooled off .
you really think a gangster is going to break his stride and become a long hair groovy river guide ? inspector , this guy ' s whole life has been stolen . <person> killed him and became him . <person> to profession and taste in clothing .
they can ' t have disappeared . no ship that small has a cloaking device .
well , there ' s no trace of them , sir .
more than two . everything i need . <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> a necklace .
i got a box of ' em . you could pick one . <continued_utterance> then you ' d have everything you need . <continued_utterance> no .

that ' s . very good .
<person> , prepare to receice outgoing fire . ! i ' ll take the first group .
<person> up , boys , that ' s our trash !
you don ' t look very happy to see me .
should i be ?
you can ' t just make a person up .
sure you can , if you know how the system works , and where the cracks are . it ' s amazing what you can accomplish by mail . mr . <person> has a birth certificate , social security card , driver ' s license . they ever track those accounts , they ' ll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination .
<person> ! you ' re so . different from the other sisters . sometimes , well . sometimes you sound more like a layperson .
<person> .
damn it dad , you scared me .
those snotty restaurant fucks wouldn ' t buy my shrimp . some bullshit about health codes or whatever . i don ' t believe that shit for a second .
i ' ve been reading where your son-in- law ' s been coming right along at tennis .

<number> percent . anti-force . <number> percent . that ' s all i ' m missing ! <person> , we can be rich together !
we ' ll beam aboard and stop it --
you can ' t !
oh , sure . here . anything else , <person> can get you ? some more chicken , perhaps . <person> <person> check the fridge .
c ' mon --
<person> ' t get mad .
so who moved it ? <continued_utterance> there ' s only two of us . maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet , and then laid it nicely in your drawer ? is that what happened ?
colter stevens . <person> .
hold the line .
what ' s this about ? because we fought ?
<person> ' t flatter yourself . i always liked that line . <continued_utterance> i love <person> , i love the children . but there is more to life than even love .
you ' re crazy . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
you ' ll see who ' s crazy . just watch .
what makes you say that ?
you ' re not someone who lies very easily . so it ' s obvious when you do . at least to me .
yes . if you like big hair .
<person> ?
sure , it you could find a towel in this bag . i know my wife packed one in there .
you always think you ' re prepared for these things .
no . not in our world . the time currents are too strong . but minor alterations , here and there , a phone call , say , those might slip through . we didn ' t know for sure . but you proved it . <person> is thunderstruck . unable to grasp it . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been thinking about the things you said on that call . as the day passed , the more i understood them . and now , i guess we ' ve caught up to each other .
man . just when i think i understand this .
it ' s not worth it . you pay too big a price . it ' s never free .
you need to get laid . <continued_utterance> it ' d be the best thing for you . you know what ? i ' m going to get you laid this week . that ' s going to be my best man gift to you . i ' m not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit .
well , i to my work , you to yours . when can i see pages ?
<person> leaves him . <continued_utterance> please god .
mmm-hmmm . <continued_utterance> if you reach for the stars , you ' re bound to get -- mm-jack , pull over .
<person> ? oh jesus . <continued_utterance> why do they call it morning sickness ?
<person> ' t seem to me like that ' s what was going on . you were all over her .
<person> had to do the talking . and by the way , i was right . she ' s not married .
like who ?
well , he ' s not president anymore , so why be petty .
<person> , i had sex three days after a heart attack and i didn ' t die ! erica pauses . oh . that kind of overwhelmed . <continued_utterance> that ' s got ta be some kind of record .
<person> ' s not brag about this to our doctor , okay ?
it ' s the one task <person> can do on his own - make coffee .
<person> up .
and you ' re the only one who ' ll ever hear that speech . just you .
well . it was a pleasure meeting you .
i have five star food , five star clothes . i sleep in a bed , not on the street . from where we come from , <person> , that is happiness .

how stupid you were to be caring about a loser like me . i agree with you wholeheartedly .
but there is no pattern . there ' s no connection at all among these places , or the computers would ' ve nailed it ! they ' re even found in random order .
well , except for the one girl .
<person> , listen very carefully . if you remember your history . in less than twenty- four hours , a vulcan ship will be passing through this system . when it does , this ship needs to be in space , flying at warp speed .

i was a member of the communist party . i was a communist . that ' s what <person> had over me . he knew everything . he held that over me . that ' s how he made me co-operate .
i have a different story to tell . i don ' t think you were tricked . not in the way you describe . i believe something else happened . i ' ve seen the hinkel archive , i ' ve seen records of phone calls , and putting it all together , this is what i think happened . i think <person> said , ' <person> , if you won ' t conduct for <person> ' s birthday , we ' ll get the miracle kid , the guy that critic , von der <person> , thinks is the greatest conductor in the world . he ' s not just willing to conduct for <person> , he ' s offered to sing `` <person> birthday '' as a solo . ' silence . <continued_utterance> come on , admit it . k worried you , didn ' t he ? he always worried you . in <number> , he ' s thirty-four years old , you ' re already fifty-six . and <person> and goering keep saying to you , ' if you don ' t do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i don ' t care how great you are . it ' s the oldest story in the book , the ageing <person> jealous of the young buck . the real reason you didn ' t leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you ' d be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party ' s boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
this is absolute nonsense !
. there are all different ways you can tell that there ' s someone really there watching out for us . you see signs . sometimes they ' re little ones . you think of someone . the phone rings . they ' re on the phone . sometimes they ' re big , like fourteen lights hovering over mexico city . sure , there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing . but there are a lot of people watching this , who think it ' s a miracle . a sign of god ' s existence . it ' s all in how you look at things <person> . what you have to decide is what kind of person you are ? are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes , things just happen by chance ?
i was at this party once . i ' m on a couch with <person> . she was just sitting there , looking beautiful and staring at me . i go to lean in and kiss her and i realize i have gum in my mouth . i turn and take out the gum . stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around . <person> throws up all over herself . i knew the second it happened . it was a miracle . i could have been kissing her when she threw up . that would have scarred me for life . i may never have recovered . <continued_utterance> i ' m a miracle man . those lights are a miracle .
they ' ll read our minds !
you ' re scaring your sister .
help him ? he could ' ve killed me . and you . the guests agree .
you were attracted to him -
oh , yeah . no . i mean yeah , i stopped by for a drink . <person> ' t see you .
i had class .
young man , when a murderer is caught , he must be tried . when he is convicted , he must be sentenced . when he is sentenced to death , he must be executed .
<person> impersonal , isn ' t it , sir ?
you sure knew a lot of people in high places .
it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .
that ' s not good enough . i want to make plans to see you .
let me get a pen out of my car . do you have something to write on ? <continued_utterance> you ' re a comedian ?
`` such mortal drugs i have but <person> ' s law is death to any he that utters them ! '' <continued_utterance> `` my poverty but not my will consents . ``
`` i pay thy poverty and not thy will . ``
i told them what you said about the script .
i didn ' t say anything special , i was just talking out loud .
that is both impudent and untrue . tell me , how did you feel when you viewed our <person> ' s latest effort ? or should i say , his `` next-to-latest '' ?
by the book , he ' s a sadist .
yeah . you okay ?
yeah . just . wondered if you could do me a favor .
i don ' t remember in detail , there were so many .
did you call someone you knew ?
i ' m doing good , good . you look great . did you lose some weight ?
oh , no , actually . <person> night .
i ' ve got a show -- at st . <person> ' s cathedral . we ' re singing for the cardinals .
you ' re gon na be singing for st . <person> if you don ' t get your ass out of here !
that ' s very kind .
both of you .
otherwise my whole life ' ll go by and i ' ll be washed up and thirty four like my mum and no one decent will ever even have snogged me !
you twat .
i don ' t think so .
<person> , this is me . i ' m going to take a look .
i mean , you handle some pretty rough traffic , huh ?
i have .
oh my god .
god ? . let me tell you something about god . he is ze biggest bitch of zem all .
<person> .
<person> can ' t come back , she ' s dead . <continued_utterance> she drills his eyes . <person> as a moose .
i don ' t see why .
maybe because you have a beautiful body . maybe that makes it easier .
oh . anything else ?
oui , da , yessiree , sure ' nuff , you betcha .
from what ?
from what ?
over six feet ?
it was very dark .
<person> mate .
what ?
because <person> knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here .
<person> . how much do you know about <person> ?
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
i saw the way you looker at her . and i know that look .
i can ' t wait , <person> .
i wish you could be me , so you could know how great it feels to be with you .
he ' s on the island , he ' ll be back on .

you know he has . you ' re not a complete fool , are you ?
frequently .
what is hitchhike ?
that ' s easy . i ' ll explain that in a minute . this is your ticket . when you get on the bus here , the driver will take this part . you will ride to omaha . when you get to omaha , ask the driver . ' <person> , please . i do not speak english . ' the star man nods that he understands . <continued_utterance> say it .
you didn ' t see it .
i . ? i saw it . i was there .
there ' s resistance ?
ineffectual . about fifty disorganized people with almost no fire power . three men are going in to clean them out ; one man ' s staying with the crawler .
<person> !
no , <person> , no .
maybe i ' ll see you again sometime , huh ?
sure .
i must say , you do look good . considering . you have a little extra baggage under your eyes , but i know how to fix that .
see what good hands i ' m in . did you meet my gorgeous assistants ?
i can not believe that . i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic . i know of your treaties with the trade federation , the commerce guilds , and the others , count . what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business . it ' s business becoming government !
are you willing to betray your jedi friends ? without your co-operation i can do nothing to stop their execution .
. <person> --
i ' m here .
you think this is nasty ? in case you haven ' t heard . the cia has no charter to operate domestically . <person> puts you in violation of federal law .
not according to the cooperation agreement , <person> <number> -- i suggest you reread the paragraph on sharing information . i happen to be well within my authority .
i can believe that .
where do you live ?
yes sir .
well , as you ' ve probably deduced , i am his son . cause i ' m at his place . as alleged .
i don ' t want to know this .
eat your pudding .
what do you mean he ' s not coming ?
get me out of here . -- get me out of here !
no , no . no . and then i , i held the post until relieved . <person> motions at scott .
well , then , we ' ve got a little problem .
i ' m not upset . why would i be upset ?
look if the truth is you don ' t feel like talking about this right now that ' s fine . but don ' t look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me . <person> there are only so many lies you ' re allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face . you wind up looking like . she stops . it ' s just too horrible .
darling , could you call back -
i ' m getting married and going to afghanistan -
oh yeah . sure . <continued_utterance> you know , in life you got ta strike when the iron ' s hot .
thanks , <person> .
no , it ' s just -- so -- honest . i don ' t think i ' ve ever heard anyone say that in a long time . <continued_utterance> well . <person> from st . <person> . i have just one more question . how does an unemployed girl with three roommates afford the patchwork denim bowley <person> vuitton bag ?
it ' s rented . `` bag , <person> or <person> . `` it ' s like <person> for purses .
will you let me out of here ?
frankly , captain , we ' re disappointed .

you got plans with the girls ?
we ' re all kinda staying in tonight .
major .
what ?
she musta done something . really bad . <continued_utterance> plane .
she ' s the worst one of all ! <continued_utterance> <person> told her he had to pee . but the way he talks . he could just say ' eeee , ' like that . <continued_utterance> she told him that recess was almost over , an ' she wasn ' t gon na make a trip special , an ' he could hold it . <continued_utterance> she made him stand against the wall .
<person> pro quo , <person> .
the significance of the moth is change . caterpillar into cocoon into beauty . <person> wants to change , too , <person> . but there ' s the problem of his size , you see . even if he were a woman , he ' d have to be a big one .
get it .
<person> , can we talk a little bit here , like two rational adults ? <continued_utterance> that would be no .
they ' re holding our old mill for ransom .

you get what you come for ?
that he ' d keep an eye on miyamoto .
did he see some <continued_utterance> all right . what did your son <continued_utterance> your witness .
major , that ' s not a good argument . if dr . <person> did indeed enjoy all these . these privileges , he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is . that ' s true of any leading artist in any country in the world .
but it still doesn ' t make them saints . they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night , don ' t they ? they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me . well , just like me . <person> ' t they ? <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> , go home now . go home and think about these past twelve years .

they have six tentacles . a new species . and the squid too . they had no stomach .
<person> a minute .
believe it or not , we have two <person> chairs -
i ' d rather have one nice piece than a room full of junk .

mr . <person> , i don ' t want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award .
i just .
<person> , <person> bar .
you better start making sense .
if you want to keep that money , all of it , just give it to your wife . <person> , the irs allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse . it ' s good up to sixty thousand dollars .
this is some rescue . when you came in here , didn ' t you have a plan for getting out ?
he ' s the brains , sweetheart .

i ' m a hemotologist , not a detective .
hi , <person> ?
lorraine ?

i ' m your son . you ' re a hard father to find .
i really think that business . matters should be discussed between you t .
well , i ' m going to discuss ' em between you , babe , cause it ' s your idea , and you think you ' re going to sign to do a , then hold us up in the wilds sweetheart , you are in error .
molecular-memory .
whatever . they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build <person> . <person>kynet . for the government . <person> ?

on the train .
you weren ' t in metcalf all this time ?
<person> . <person> , i think it ' s amazing you ' re getting it published . really . i know how hard it is . just to write it even .
<person> . thanks .

a pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match ! it ' s a new wrinkle to tell the truth . i never thought i ' d make a killing on some guy ' s `` integrity '' .
fifty shillings . pounds .

<person> hasn ' t killed himself . i ' m sure of that . there ' s a private detective on the case now - a mr maccarron - <person> ' s father ' s employing him .
no , i ' ll be fine here for tonight <number> as long as i ' m not putting you or <person> to any trouble . <continued_utterance> . what are you doing . with a coffin ?
that ' s not how you ' re supposed to ask . you ' re supposed to be a young lady who is very impressed with . my mind . having come from a deep hungarian film and getting cozy over a brandy , she says . ' is that . a coffin . ? ' and , then i say , ' yes , it ' s my coffin ' . ' your coffin , ' she would gasp , her interest in me growing by leaps and bounds . then ' i would sit back stroking her arm and say ' yes , i figured we ' re going to spend a long time in the ground together so i ' ve made friends with it . i ' ve gotten drunk on it . rolled joints on it . even made love on it many times ! ' it ' s a prop for affect .
<person> , this is me . i ' m going to take a look .
<person> ' t leave me . i ' m coming .
<person> , ask your own manager - he ' s standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife . so how do you get him doing j . j . a favor ?
it is a favor , isn ' t it ?
they took it apart with a tweezers .
she was there . the girl was there . i ' m going back . i want you to do something .
you think i made that up about the gun . <continued_utterance> see , you didn ' t believe me ! . now i suppose you don ' t think i have the courage !
oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .
you don ' t know that .
<person> ' s say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us , just like we are to , say , medieval europe . suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set . there wouldn ' t be any place to plug it in .
breeding goats ? baking fucking biscuits ? it ' s meaningless !
<person> . when i was lost with my book you helped me more than you know . you asked who i was writing it for . <continued_utterance> you .
the ncxt generation . much better flashlight .
<person> , if there ' s all these people who got this power , why doesn ' t everybody know about it ? why isn ' t it common knowledge ?
your authority ends now . it ' s all over .
what ' s over .
two or three hundred i guess . <person> played two a day when i was in shea ' s mob . we had it down to a business . ' <person> was a right town then . the fix was in . the dicks took their end without a beef . all the wall street boys wanted to make investments for us . even had marks looking us up , thinkin ' they could beat the game . <person> , kid , it really stunk . no sense in bein ' a grifter if it ' s the same as bein ' a citizen . <continued_utterance> i better do some packin ' . i ' m gon na be a hot number again after tomorrow .

what ' s wrong with the water next to your bed ?
it tastes old .
<person> , if there ' s all these people who got this power , why doesn ' t everybody know about it ? why isn ' t it common knowledge ?
it is . a lotta people know . unfortunately , the easiest people to convince , the believer types , they also tend to be the dumbest . and people who demand proof -- well , this isn ' t something we can control , it comes when it comes , so if you can ' t make it happen , how can you prove it ? it ' s like that singing frog in the cartoon , but when the guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk . <person> laughs , horribly . he likes that cartoon . neil some of us try anyway . i say who needs that kind of aggravation ?
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship . my . eh . we kidnapped it . on it there was a map that said how to come to earth . this was very important . <person> then , we thought we were the only people in all the stars .

well , then , you didn ' t see it , right ?

<person> ! a great warrior . wars not make one great .
put that down . hey ! that ' s my dinner !
yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , i heard all about that .
in a dictatorship , art belongs to the party . if you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .
yeah , hi , can you put on <person> ?
really . at first i was all : `` you can ' t tell me what i can do '' -- but then , i had to admit he had a point .

-- no matter how sparkling your record is , no matter how terrified you are to fail -- finally he stops , turns on her:
i have to go .

what are you doing up ?
i was thirsty .
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days .
what ? be my body guard ? here ' s my body , theo . guard it . for my dad ' s sake . for your career . <person> starts to unbutton her bowling shirt .
lorraine ?

she doesn ' t mind ; it ' s like <person> to her . if she ' s ready she ' ll stand for him , if not she won ' t .
i ' ll bet he hasn ' t shaved in a week . i ' ll bet he stinks .
<person> up , <person> . what ' ll it be ?

we ' ll get a ride in the morning .
but he always came back .
well you might have noticed that we have moved , you should have fed him more , a dog will never leave you if you feed it properly . it was a good dog , he had a little flatulence problem but was a good dog .
you ' ve got to say something .
you are a terrible wife .
can it work ?
it can . ordinary matter , like ours ? not affected . everything else , disintegrates . <continued_utterance> what i ' m saying is : <person> ' t trust anyone . find yourself a weapon of some sort .
<person> , it ' s amazing tonight . i want to cry , i ' m so touched .
mr . <person> , i would like to discuss an arrangement for the series .
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that . nels but a drowned person can ' t breathe . <continued_utterance> of course not . the foam means that he went <continued_utterance> well .
your report says death by <continued_utterance> can you tell whether an object moved against the head , or the other way around ? or would both look the same .
prem ? tone it down , for goodness sake . you ' re making him a laughing stock . prem glances up at the gallery with contempt .
we ' re having fun here . they love it . where the hell do you get them from ?
are they still there ?
no .
what are they listening to ?
i don ' t care . oy . <person> . . . <continued_utterance> i know she ' ll never see him after this weekend . she can ' t commit either .

so you ' ve decided to speak .
rutledge . get him .
<person> , we always thought you were the supreme authority , mr . <person> .
in my classroom , you bet . whether it ' s exerted by ten or ten billion , political authority is violence by degree . the people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it .
welcome aboard , commander . i hope , your transfer didn ' t come as too much of a surprise .
i was . honored , sir .
if you don ' t - can you still afford to go to <person> ?

<person> . i guess i do , sir .

did my father send you ?
. that ' s right .
why , you little doublecrosser . i didn ' t want this divorce , you did . that ' s what you ' ve been harping about for the past year .
it ' s a woman ' s privilege to change her mind . now i can shop for some pretty clothes . i wouldn ' t want you to be ashamed of me in washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties .
other clinics ? oh sure . <person> , half-way houses , treatment centers , detox units .
then . when did she get better ?
you ' re crazy -- !
i saw it -- !
<person> ?
the internet . <person> ' t worry , i ' ll teach you someday . <continued_utterance> when did you get released ?
who was just here ?
<person> , man . pay attention .
some days i ' m not even the next <person> . <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>
. and ?
as best we can estimate , it crashed four hundred years ago .
four hundred ? you ' re kidding , right ?
maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in . and then all of a sudden , it ' s all taken away . no one asked them . it ' s just gone .
you have nice red in your cheeks now .
no , it isn ' t . your name is <person> . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the one you couldn ' t save . what was his name ? `` <person> , we ' re going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . `` `` but i don ' t want to go swimming , <person> . i ' m scared . `` `` c ' mon , <continued_utterance> when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i can ' t get <person> on the radio . i ' m in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . `` was it really the squid that was attacking you , <person> -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ? <continued_utterance> i ' m not scaring you , am i <person> ? i hope i ' m not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , don ' t you ?
it ' s not me , <person> . i swear . it can ' t be .
<person> so ?
the mayor ' s outside .

she knows i ' m not monogamous . we ' ve discussed it .
<person> class <person> , engineers mate , sir .
your first training voyage , mr .
people like <person> who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money .
i think she ' s pretty , <person> .
of course . <person> , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing <person> to select a program ?
but . wait a minute .

i don ' t , but .

better question , where you ' ve been so long , do you like girls ?
we have . you will have . the most beautiful .
no thanks , <person> .
what ' s your malfunction , <person> ?
well , why does it ?
because the second lantern , the one on the mast . was never found . so we have to ask . <continued_utterance> . where did it go ? <continued_utterance> maybe it went . where <person> went .
the taxi life , you mean .
yeah .
i don ' t want to lose our life here . i don ' t want all the debt to pile up and crush us .
it won ' t . we ' re safe . ouisa in bed turns off the light .

i am not a swinger . i am unwell .
<person> ' t worry , i ' m a doctor . <continued_utterance> i ' m so glad you made it back to the enterprise before i left .
you know something ? you should ' ve written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than <person> . what do you imagine people thought ? the berlin philharmonic ' s taken over by <person> and his propaganda ministry but <person> is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?
have no idea what ordinary people thought .
i went to a few bars first . later , i decided to drive to mr . <person> ' s home and confront them . they weren ' t there . so i parked my car in the turnout . and waited .
with what intention ?
she said we ' re getting remarried ?
only a fire drill . my concern is that <person> seems apathetic towards her work knowing she ' s leaving before the end of the semester .
<person> - i heard that one .
. i don ' t want to go home .
new york . <person> .
new york ? <continued_utterance> do you know where i got on ?
break all those dishes ! two million ! go to ten ! and we put up nothing ?

for what ?
for abandoning you .
how ' s your wife feel about it ?
what ?
just talk . tell me about my son . is he tall ?
about my height . he has your -- . damn . he has your eyes .
it may be that - i could confer with my colleagues on this . and get back to you .
would you , <person> ? that would be so kind .
no . i ' m not meeting him . absolutely not . you ever go fishing ? the bait always dies .
he won ' t get within fifty feet of you . the second we see him , the cuffs go on .
may i say you smell real special .
it must be my new shampoo .
that ' s a nice name .
that ' s what you think .
this is <person> .
i love you !
was the judge and <person> friends ?
that ' s what you ' d say . <person> managed all <person> ' s business . besides which they was regular drinkin ' pals -- played poker together most nights -- tho ' they do say <person> got the worst of it .
will be if i ever get dry .
<person> that --
<person> .
<person>rrrr .
conscientious , determined , dogged .
they said i was dogged ?

it ' s not brain surgery , <person> .

they ' ve come for my car .
something . i ' ve got . you don ' t .
you rich kids . are all the same !

<person> ' s got ta be .
where are you going , man why you running ?
thanks . we ' re expecting our second in a couple of months . <continued_utterance> how are you ? you look just the same .
i ' m good . really good !
<person> he ' s a sweet , kind and loving person . we like each other , but i don ' t want to think any further . it ' s taken me a long time to get back to dating , and i want to take things real steady this time .
well , you can trust me not to tell him anything .
but . one soldier against seventeen !
i am going to kill them all , sir .
i see you ' re full of human feelings .
he has lost interest in sidney . <continued_utterance> like most of the human race , sidney , i ' m bored . i ' d go a mile for a chuckle .
surely he must be dead by now .
<person> ' t underestimate the power of the force .
he ' s no good to me dead .
he will not be permanently damaged .
it would be truer to say , i think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .
you were real close to all of them , to <person> , to <person> , to joseph , to baldur , and now <person> , so , let ' s hear the truth , let ' s come clean . what was your party number ?
yes , and now you ' ve got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation .
we ' ll get them , sir . these things take time .
have a care with my name , you will wear it out . <continued_utterance> the queen of england does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint . come here , <person> . let me look at you . <continued_utterance> yes , the illusion is remarkable and your error , mr . <person> , easily forgiven , but i know something of a woman in a man ' s profession , yes , by <person> , i do know about that . that is enough from you , <person> . if only <person> were here .
he is , <person> ' am .
my quaint laws ? last i checked you were an american citizen . and these happen to be the only laws we got . <person> , i ' m just a cop , okay , and i ' m real sorry the cold war ' s over , and you masters of the universe got nothing going on over there in afghanistan or iraq or wherever -- but you ' re just not in the middle east anymore .
oh , really . ?
but you didn ' t do much about it , <person> . you walked out , and there i was . solo . and not too good at that .
i just didn ' t think that i could antagonize him , <person> -- for our sake , i mean .
it tastes old .
what ' s the rule about getting up in the middle of the night ?
<person> . we don ' t have any torpedoes .
<person> ' t tell me . tuesday .
i can ' t play anymore .
are you hurt ? what does that mean , you can ' t play ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
she ' s not real either , is she ? nothing here is . nothing here matters . all euphoria is now gone from kirk -- it ' s a moment of self-revelation . he glances around . <continued_utterance> it ' s kinda like . orbital skydiving . exciting for a few minutes . but in the end , you haven ' t really done anything . you haven ' t made a difference . <continued_utterance> captain of the enterprise , huh ?
that ' s right .
who are you ?
i am .
i said , ' yeah . i ' d even do it for free . '
uh huh . and i said , ' that ' s good , because i like the feeling of someone watching me . i acquired the taste from <person> . '
and i am feeling that <person> on you .
<person> till tuesday . <continued_utterance> here -- time to re-join the world .
please don ' t look at me like that .
why not ?
hey , my plate is full .
well , okay . what ' s the big deal ? if she ' ll forget the new fireplace , i ' ll marry her . just point me in the right direction .
-- <person> .
they ' re want the newsies here . they want everybody watching . <continued_utterance> you ' ve got the shooters in place ?
i want that money you took from my brother last night .
are you crazy ? or just ignorant ?
you look me in the face and lie !
for god ' s sake ; we ' re surrounded by
but why the dalmatian ?
it was either that , or a sardine . <continued_utterance> you get what you pay for .
crom .
i ' m <person> . they ' ll train you for the games , but . well , i hope you make it okay . hey , what ' s going on in the other sectors ? i ' ve been stuck in this grid for <number> microcycles .
<person> , i left a message .
i will never forgive you .
that ' s not the same caravan .
this isn ' t the same fight .
i ' ll miss you , <person> . <continued_utterance> it was nice having you `` watch over me '' .
yeah . i liked being around you too . <person> . <continued_utterance> let ' s go home .
when your son came back from the war , what did he say about all this ?
that he ' d keep an eye on miyamoto .
sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . <person> above your left ear . <continued_utterance> you wouldn ' t even see it move .
you ' re wonderin ' . how come i never ask . if you did it . <continued_utterance> now , you ' ve told me you killed four men . in germany . so i know you are the kind of man who can kill . when there ' s a reason . kabuo guess i am . <continued_utterance> you feel guilty . that you took their lives . that ' s in your eyes . strikes a match . nels jury sees what i see . more often than not . <continued_utterance> prosecutor thinks . what was your reason ? to kill <person> . <continued_utterance> well , there is the land itself . <person> your children where you were raised . <person> with your wife at night , ' stead of bein ' alone on the sea . <continued_utterance> there ' s fairness and honor . you were cheated by that old bitch . <person> , she is something . kabuo she ' s not alone . worlds within those words . nels none of us are . <continued_utterance> and prejudice , like you say . your people locked in a concentration camp . you go off to fight for our country ' s freedom . come back to this . <continued_utterance> but mr . <person> has missed the <continued_utterance> and you weren ' t thinking about her . or about land . or about you . no , you weren ' t . and in the gentlest voice . <continued_utterance> no , someone cheats you , you can rise above that . you ' re a family man . you put them ahead of you , hmmn ? <continued_utterance> wasn ' t you she dishonored . <continued_utterance> your father was a strong and tireless man . <person> to a fault . <person> , and humble as well . there is a silence . and then . kabuo nice . when two fellas . understand each other . <continued_utterance> now this jury is gon na be lookin ' at the evidence with one eye .
where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours ?
in a deep freeze .
las vegas , please .
we ' re going to l . a . <continued_utterance> sure . get in . we can drop you in vegas or get you darn close .
think of this business like a big aquarium . you got ta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top . <continued_utterance> profits down there , philanthropy up here . besides , it beats the pants off bingo .
nice set-up .
so . i killed <person> . then you ran in , being on his payroll , and shot me .
that ' s pretty much the way it happened .
oh , wow . i ' ll tell you what . when the baby is born , we ' ll go out in my back yard and wave to you .
i will wave to you . <continued_utterance> oh , shit !
turns , slashing win .
gasps . <person> begins to seep from his wound .

will you stay here till i fall asleep ?
i really wanted you to call me , and i thought you were never going to --
you could have called me --
what ' d he say ?
`` you ' re fired . ``
i don ' t think i could really describe it .
why not ?
corpses ? whose corpses ? the passengers ?
some were too badly burned to be identified .
<person> , that ' d be real nice of ya , mr .
<person> .
maybe we can fix your eyes . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t let this hurt us , okay ? whatever happens .
it won ' t . you ' ll see .
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world . nothing really bad is going to happen , is it <person> ?
<person> ' t worry .
let me get a pen out of my car . do you have something to write on ? <continued_utterance> you ' re a comedian ?
<person> . and an actor .
<person> ' s got him working for some korean gangster , and i actually think billy is doing a great job .
<person> . <person> .
the secret service agent , was he fucking <person> . ?
he was off-post , with his girlfriend .
fixing it ? but i fixed -- where ' d you get all that ?
the refrigerator .
a name i picked up reading an obituary in the paper . i sent away to <person> and got his birth records and social security number . this way , i never have to worry about immigration . i spent weeks watching tapes of <person> five-o just to get the accent right . `` book ' em <person> '' .
and you knew ?
well , then , what ' s he doing here ?
what ' re you doing here ?
<person> could be hiding behind that rock .
a distinct possibility .
why do you say that ?
i just happen to know it . i had a nightmare and i screamed for you . you weren ' t here . where were you ?
well , maybe i was wrong , too . but there ' s no doubt , <person> , that we have to face some serious things .
no one ' s ever stood up to my brother the way you did .
do you think obi-wan ' s apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force ?
only if he chooses to follow his destiny .
i can ' t help it .
he ' s nothing like you .
<person> . ?
we have to follow them back . repair whatever damage they ' ve done to that time-line .
<person> ?
how do you spell it ?
can you do something for me ? <continued_utterance> think about what you want from our time together . what our goal should be ?
something i want ?
mate , neither have i . i just got back from some girls yard .

<person> is nuts , don ' t you agree ?
me and my dad , we don ' t see eye to eye . we ' re just two different people .
as opposed to being the exact same person ?
i ' ll find billy .
i was kidding .
you should read the trial , maybe .
if you say so , i will . <person> ' t wait till wednesday . i ' m so excited to see it .
it sounds nice .
boats . you go out in them . you come back in them . i hate them .
what do you mean -- your murder , <person> ?
well , he ' d read about me in the paper . he knew about <person> -- and about you . he suggested that if he got rid of <person> for me , i should kill his father .
<person> .
<person> choice . i ' m going to have a cheeseburger with bacon . <person> bacon .
hey man , don ' t sweat it .
. it ' s just that you ' ve been there .
<person> i do , i want to fuck you .
<person> , you know i really like you , <person> , but this is . it ' s just too intense . and i ' m so drunk i don ' t even know how to , like , process-
who is she ? she ' s beautiful .
i ' m afraid i ' m not quite sure , sir .
because . i ' ve started writing .
you can write anywhere .
i can ' t imagine it ' s that difficult . . no rudder on the board .
now this is a place of many wonders . see those guys in line over there ? <continued_utterance> we call them `` <person> '' . they all have season passes , and do little more than ride the wave all day long . some of them get pretty good . <continued_utterance> that ' s where they hang out when they ' re not riding the wave . <person> ' t get too close to them .
ok . i ' d do <person> .
i wan na be her , in that dress with him licking my teapot lids .
he ' s good , <person> .
please don ' t fall in love with him .
no . no , i haven ' t .
wow . now why do you think that is ?
i am afraid it ' s too late for that <person> . - <continued_utterance> we want half and that ' s because we are being generous . we could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone .
you fuckin idiots . he couldn ' t know who i am . now open the case and give me . the stone . <continued_utterance> who ' s next ? you have the ten grand now give me the stone .
did you ever work with her ?
oh sure , me ' n <person> used to help her do alterations for old mrs . <person> . lots of people worked for her , she had the business from all these retail stores ? but she was like , totally old , it was more ' n she could handle .
it ' s true .
i ' m sorry the experiment didn ' t work . i wanted it to with all my heart . i wanted to do that picnic with my daughter . i feel i ' ve disappointed you terribly .
how do we know boards will do anything ?
because , they seem to have trouble with pantry doors .
you too ?
yeah .
what do you mean ?
it ' s just a word . <person> ' t get all bent out of shape . <person> .
we ' ve actually been alone for an hour . seems almost indecent . you like ?
i like .
<person> left ?
i thought she was with you .
no really , it ' s okay , i ' ve got ta go . i ' m expecting some calls . i ' ll be fine , really .
i ' ll think about wednesday .

you ' re the best fun in the world . i ' d love to marry you . <continued_utterance> can i say it then ?
oh that ' s easy , you just got ta find the clitoris .
<person> ?
i think it ' s true .
i shouldn ' t have done that .
from hunsecker ' s viewpoint . <continued_utterance> j . j . if you ' re trying to -
you , little boy , don ' t know who you are ! talking around corners with the big shots , ten dollar dinners - fourteen suits and cashmere coats - you tell yourself that ' s who you are ! later you won ' t know who you are without a penthouse on upper <person> ! but underneath it all , ratting around from day to day , you do know who you are ! you ' re a fearful , ignorant nobody - a poor wop kid from the slums of philly - hoping nobody else finds it out !
i don ' t think so .
ah , but if i must . <continued_utterance> i have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the dark side . it gives me infinitely greater power .
i don ' t have a bank account . <continued_utterance> but i ' ll take cash .
<person> . <person>s like the producer ' s stolen my wallet again-

six .
call a friend and have her meet the three of us at the landlubber lounge at <number> : <number> .
i don ' t agree with you . in any case -- if you must have it -- i ' d no intention of engaging a man at foreman ' s wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman !
you take care what you ' re saying .

help him ? he could ' ve killed me . and you . the guests agree .
<person> .
what ' s this about ? because we fought ?
but who ' s going to fly it , kid ! you ?
you bet i could . i ' m not such a bad pilot myself ! we don ' t have to sit here and listen .
you got to tell ' em that you saw the accident . <person> ' t you ?
i can ' t do that . if i tell them , they ' ll , if i tell them , they ' ll try <person> for rape , they ' ll .
oh but why `` alas ? ''
a lowly player .
do you owe anybody money ? you can tell me off the record if you need too .
no .
no .
you have to add some twists and stuff . maybe they run out of gas .
i don ' t know . just different . like the food is really sweet .
i thought you liked sweet things .
maybe i ' ll close early . cash or charge ? <continued_utterance> <person> , i can ' t sell the ammo with the guns . you ' ll have to -- -hey ! <continued_utterance> you can ' t to that .
<person> .
i ' m having the salmon .
that ' s what i ' m having .
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays .
we better get you back to the ship . <person> to enterprise .
i think our relationship is growing by the way . have you noticed ? <continued_utterance> i ' m serious . maybe we just needed to get out of the house . now , you may notice , interestingly , we ' re walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again .
of course it ' s getting a little rocky , we ' re talking about you .
that ' s all right .
you think i ' m crazy .
it doesn ' t make sense . these coordinates are well within regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless .
if <person> was completed , it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground .
but look at rites look at this ! i ' m a nun ! i ' m invisible ! i ' m a penguin !
as of now , and until you leave , you are <person> .
<person> ? <continued_utterance> my lord -- when you can not find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse . <continued_utterance> but playwrights teach nothing about love , they make it pretty , they make it comical , or they make it lust . they can not make it true .
oh , but they can ! <continued_utterance> i mean your majesty , they do not , they have not , but i believe there is one who can
people who will help our cause .
well , there ' s the hamiltons . <person> and shelly hamilton .
<person> . you ' re not thinking about using that thing are you ?
it has occurred to me on several occasions . but i believe this may be the appropriate time .
nothing .
nothing ?
<person> .
you know how long i ' ve been begging to take you on the wine tour . i was beginning to think it was never going to happen .
<person> ? <person> ' t forget who your real mother is , <person> . are you going to prefer her cooking to mine now ?
impossible . i love you , mom .
it was an adventure which i ' ll remember .
your english is genius . do you dream in spanish or english ?
<person> ' s hope that luck holds . <person> out . the transmission ends .
lay in a new course . take us to <person> . warp eight .
he is .
oh . i needed that . thank you . <continued_utterance> so what are you guys up to tonight ?
you ' re on your own . stop being chicken-hearted and write that story .
<person> to goodness , i hate you .
can i say one thing ? i mean , the <continued_utterance> yah ? well , even the best mom in the world , the smartest , the wisest , whatever . needs to know when to find a plan b . <person> a is not and will n .
it ' s
i ' m not leaving , threepio . i just can ' t sleep .
that ' s something i can not relate to . as a protocol droid , i ' m either active or inactive .
what are you going to do , <person> ?
i don ' t know . when i met my wife , it was so clear . i just knew .
she ' ll come back , don ' t worry . but then what ? my theory is she can only live here , that she will die if she leaves this ship . <continued_utterance> why do you think she hasn ' t suggested that ? it ' s the most obvious solution : <person> . she knows she can ' t leave here --
get out --
sure , we talk the same language .
i ' m glad you enjoyed it . i thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself .
the daughter of his enemy .
his best friend is killed in a duel by <person> ' s brother or something . his name is <person> .
i bet he ' s lying .
<person> went to new york .
<person> ! we can have ice cream from <person> ' s .
every day if we want . <continued_utterance> it ' s my turn .
<person> happened before .
<person> marinara .
i ' m good . really good !
god , i always envied you so much . head cheerleader . dating the quarterback . so did you and mac end up getting married ?
you ' re speaking of emotional investment ?
the b- <number> is like a slow child , sir . and <person> , in his own way , has assumed the position of a parent or guardian . i ' m afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences . he ' ll be disappointed when the b- <number> can not meet those expectations .
what ' s with you ?
nothing ' s with me .
they will love it every place . read it . read the scene just before she has him killed !
right now ? never let another writer read your stuff . he may steal it .
after i saw you in the theater that afternoon , i had another `` episode .
oh , i ' m sorry .
yes yes er not quite right it is more let me `` then have my lips the sin that they have took . ``
sin from my lips ? oh trespass sweetly urg ' d . give me my sin again . `` <continued_utterance> `` you kiss by th ' book . ``
what makes you so sure he was the last cell ?
<person> .
<person> ' t remind me .
you just sat around drinking orange juice . now look at you . <person> how far you ' ve come in just a few months . you got that part in that movie .
<person> is deuce .
<person> serves .
i ' d like to meet your mother .
no you wouldn ' t . i mean , she ' s great . she ' s totally brilliant , but she ' s not your type .
well , whad ' ya know .
<person> ' t mess with the boss . so what ' d the captain say ?
oil .
<person> . ?
warp drive still inoperative . all other systems should be restored shortly .
excellent . we have all the time in the world .
we liked him immediately .
. so i ' m backin ' out the door , right ? had the tv like this . big ol ' thing . <person> ' t see shit . suddenly , here ' s this voice : <person> kid ! hands in the air ! well i just stand there holdin ' on to that tv , so the voice says : `` you hear what i said , boy ? '' and i say , <person> sir , i sure did ! but if i drop this fuckin ' thing , you got me on destruction of property too !
who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . <person> up , he ' s probably in purgatory by now . <person> makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again .
you ' re really pissing me off .
we were worried about you and this affair with your boss .
<person> is the greatest .
<person> or surrounded ?
a senator , an agent and something - with - long - red - hair .
it ' s your choice . because it ' s not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .
it ' s not safe for you to be either .
what do you mean ?
`` an <person> . `` did you ever see it ? cary grant and <person> . before that it was called `` <person> and <person> . ``
this is friday , her riding lesson is on tuesdays . i got it right here .
<person> tuesday except the <number> rd tuesday of the month when it ' s switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday . it ' s not that hard . <person> ' t you have a mother ?
it was only an accident that we discovered them .
i know , but . <continued_utterance> you married , <person> ?
is that right ? come on . answer me . <continued_utterance> were you trying to steal my baby ? huh ? answer me !
jennyhaydn !
that was more consideration . than i deserve .
did your aunt tell you about all <continued_utterance> the money ? <continued_utterance> <person> told us it came from <person>cau . agnis hush yoursel . <continued_utterance> . from <person> . and it was more than she expected . and we shipped the chairs off to her . y ' know , the three remaining ? a really frozen beat . quoyle uh . why would she send you more tha . agnis do you have enough attention now , young lady ? <continued_utterance> yes , <person> ' am , i think so . <person>vis echoes <person> ' glare . quoyle <person>cau , huh ? so . that where y ' sent th ' chairs ?
of course , sit down . he sits at his desk she sits across from him .
it ' s about <person> i ' ve watched him with the b- <number> and i ' m troubled . <person> ' s desire for a `` family '' is very strong . i ' m afraid he may be investing too much in the b- <number> .
<person> went on a river trip . <person> was a guide . <continued_utterance> those are e-mails between <person> and <person> discussing the trip one year ago .
you connected <person> and <person> ?
i sense something . a presence i haven ' t felt since .
get me a scanning crew in here on the double . i want every part of this ship checked !
it ' s y . o . h .
yeah . what ' s that ?
no way ! i work there . they know i ' m not twenty-five .
<person> said anything about you , dick- mouth . you have one name on your id . it ' s out of the equation !
i saw us here . you did too .
<person> . you made your point .
he was quite happy not to talk about the past .
i did a sketch of him .
but how am i to know the good side from the bad ?
you will know . when you are calm , at peace . passive . a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense , never for attack .
yeah , that ' s been a while now . dropped the luggage around the time your other lot when out of business .
i could maybe drop it to nineteen even . <continued_utterance> and toss in some wiper fluid .
that she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains .
well -- why should i deny it ? .
yeah ? why , if it isn ' t <person> !
<person> , <person> . now open that gate .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
that ' s it ! there it is ! and the next pitch .
<person> is a far better man than you !
thank you .
she ' ll be easier to print if we turn her over . <person> , will you give me a hand ?
yessir , i will . clarice takes a jar from her kit , carefully drops the cocoon inside .
that ' s not good enough .
<person> , whatever you want me to do , i ' ll do . i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up , okay ?
<person> and how do you say escargot ?
escargot . i ' d stay away from them if i were you . heavy garlic .
yeah .
i know .
you think i ' d really drink that ?
you don ' t think i put something in it , do you ?
i say .
but you ' re a girl , what do you know ?
i gave up school . and my job at st . <person> ' s . and you never even knew about it . it ' s kind of funny , isn ' t it ?
the reason i didn ' t know . is because all of this happened
. what . ?
. we ' re going to take a little trip . <continued_utterance> . put that away .
why wouldn ' t i report you ?
because i ' ll do anything ! please !
you have to give them your phone number or they won ' t let you go on the air . <continued_utterance> `` dear sleepless in seattle : i am an swf '' -- what is that ?
<person> . something you don ' t know . it ' s a single white female .
<person> me for asking , sir , but what good are snub fighters going to be against that ?
well , the empire doesn ' t consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat , or they ' d have a tighter defense . an analysis of the plans provided by princess leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station . <continued_utterance> the approach will not be easy . you are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point . the target area is only two meters wide . it ' s a small thermal exhaust port , right below the main port . the shaft leads directly to the reactor system . a precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station . <continued_utterance> only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction . the shaft is ray- shielded , so you ' ll have to use proton torpedoes .
what happened ?
well , this , for one thing .
<person> , pretend we ' re fairies . i ' m a girl fairy and my name is . la-ru . lee . and you ' re a boy fairy and your name is <person> .
ok .
i already met <person> harolday .
oh .
what was it that made you know ?
i don ' t think i could really describe it .
what did we get her ?
it ' s from all of us . your mother too .
the borg . some of them must ' ve beamed over before we destroyed their ship . <person> off that entire deck with emergency force fields .
<person> . <person> was down there .
' cause it ' s better to do it all at once . we ' re puttin ' down <number> grand next week . at <number> - <number> we make <number> million . <person> per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us .
you got a system , <person> ?
captain -- !
tactical analysis , <person> .
<person> got knocked out of the sky over big k .
i like it . it ' s kinda . you .
<person> ! <person> ! ow ! <person> ! -
<person> .
why are we still moving towards it ?
we ' re caught in a tractor beam ! it ' s pulling us in !
raise them -- joachim punches frantically --
they won ' t --
hey . wan na ride ?
sure .
<person> . <person> . just `` <person> '' . so i go in . `` hello . hi . we loved your guest spot on baywatch . blah blah blah . `` whatever . so , i start to read , and , <person> , i was money . i prepared for a week . it ' s a starring role . i ' m crying . the casting director , she starts crying .
no !
i ' ve gotten <number> , <number> times smarter since then .
what do you want with the pentagon ?
hey , asshole ! that ' s not cool !
throw me his ball .
<person> . ? <continued_utterance> finders keepers , losers weepers .
what ?
then why am i here ?
what ?
you wouldn ' t have a problem if it was a person .
but it ' s not , it ' s a dog and i have never done a dog .
i must tell the cardinal . i . <number> send him a personal letter , describing your efforts , your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive .
<person> ?
the drama in life is what makes you strong .
no , it ' s what makes you strong . you ' ve never really understood this , but we ' re not all like you .
proceed , <person> .
<person> . <person> , y ' know how you and <person> . slept together ? well now that you can ' t , y ' know , `` sleep together , '' but you still sleep together , don ' t you ever get , like , just , super horny ? if so , how horny ? i ' ll be quiet now so i can listen to your answer .
later for you , pal .
<person> .
i don ' t run the scams , <person> , i just process the profits . that ' s a fine line , maybe . but i ' ve also built that library , and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas . why do you think the warden lets me do all that ?
to keep you happy and doing the laundry . <person> instead of sheets .
does it have to be an old <person> ? where have you been ?
i was in new hampshire . i was at the old location .
a few days ago .
does he stay with you here ?
with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good .
i think you loused this up but good . if i can trust my eyes , and i think i can , <person> knows all about your dirty work .
-- that ' s what they ' re telling me .
-- and nobody ' s hurt ? <continued_utterance> <person> .
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t be going down . thinks it ' s a mistake . <continued_utterance> she told me what you said , <person> .
what is it , <person> ?
<person> , here ' s the number . are you ready ?
go ahead .
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information .
<person> , are you all right ?
no , no i met her when i was on <person> .
you put her in your book !
<person> , warm-ups are over . back to work , <person> .
' bye beautiful . you too , <person> .
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship ?
no . can i move now ?
you want to put him on your couch , <person> . <person> him about his childhood ?
when he uses a phrase like `` i am <person> '' , i think we should think twice about what we ask him . `` do not be <person> '' the all stare at the screen , stunned . <continued_utterance> <person> , can you understand what we ' re saying ? `` every word '' <person> walks up to the screen , close to it . <continued_utterance> <person> , can you read our minds ? `` yes <person> '' <person> goes to the intercom .
they didn ' t . but we are meant to think they did . these tracks are side by side . <person> always ride single file to hide there numbers .
these are the same <person> that sold us <person> and threepio .
any of it . why did he kill himself ?
i don ' t know , why did you ?
and you ' re from the future too ?
right .
ah , but if i must . <continued_utterance> i have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the dark side . it gives me infinitely greater power .
you will have to prove it .
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
i still got one ace to play . <person> ' s got what i want . and i ' ve got what he wants .
i don ' t understand .
that ' s okay .
why didn ' t you say good-bye ?
you were gassing away to nicola .
terminated .
will it melt in there ?
he can ' t know that it ' s you <person> . we do too much business together . you ' re gon na have to get someone else to hit him and there is no way it can relate to us . you understand ?
yes i understand .
i call it luck .
in my experience , there ' s no such thing as luck .
there ' s nothing like cash money in your pocket . what ' s that over there ?
oh , you ' ll find this ride interesting .
we ' ve been working for this your whole life , <person>ito . oh , my god ! you ' re so close . i don ' t understand .
<person> ' t worry , mom . i have some money .
temporal nexus . yeah , i heard you . something ' s missing .
<person> , i need your help . i want you to leave the nexus with me .
no kidding .
so , this could be your last night , huh ?
<person> . what about strickland ?
no . bad idea .
i will not have it butchered .
of course not . but it ought to be organized . just an editing job . you can find somebody .
she doesn ' t want to bare her breasts . what , in the `` nude scene ? '' what are we paying her three mil for ?
she ' s got `` religion . ``
there appears to be a dampening field in operation . i can not scan beyond the bulkhead . <person> puts his tricorder away and begins looking for a way to open the door .
i don ' t see a control panel . or an access port .
has anyone else come out of that bathroom that you remember ?
who are you ?
it wouldn ' t work .
i know .
i can ' t - i can ' t do it . he ' s my brother .
he ' s my father .
<person> enough . a rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long . looks like a miniature pickaxe , with a small sharp pick on one end , and a blunt hammerhead on the other . it ' s for rocks .
rocks . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
where ? found him in a junk pile ?
oh , what a mess . <person> , do you think you can repair him ?
what for ?
you think i am going to let you out of my sight again , little brother ? you stay with me now .
you ' re with <person> . <continued_utterance> are you functional ?
i ' m dizzy .
neither had i , but think about it . <person> ' s a unique thing in a woman . it ' s fun to be around .
there ' s some reason we ' ve been watching these two for <number> o years .
sold in marriage and half way to america .
at sea , then -- a voyage to a new world ? she lands upon a vast and empty shore . she is brought to the duke <person> .
i shouldn ' t have listened to you , i should ' ve followed you right into the `` can '' the way he did .
if i had known i was going to have company , he was right next to me . i think he heard me peeing ! i hate that , i am glad he ' s in jail . <continued_utterance> lieutenant garber says when i identify him , they ' re going to lock him up and throw away the key . <continued_utterance> i guess i ' m supposed to do it in the morning . identify him .
i think you testified <continued_utterance> and yet you started the engine right up . with all those lights drawing all night , the batteries had that much charge . did that strike you odd ?
<person> ' t think about it at the time .
i want to have a wedding . with you .
no .
i got a company . give us a million dollars , put their product in the film .

i know .
maybe you should see a shrink .
but , <person> , i used to wait outside her house , . ring the bell and then when she ' d come to the window i ' d run away . just to get a glimpse of her .
the night <person> gave me the kiss- off , i fucked a black hooker three times .
huh ?

yes that ' s what i said . i t ' s fuckin <person> .
it may be fuckin him , but wait and see what i can do to you .
<person> ' t you study knife fighting , son . you learn to <person> . and then , f ' you meet some other fellow , studied knife fighting , you send him to hell .
next man : a trainee stands . <continued_utterance> now : i want to see some evil intent .
i ' m just saying:
yeah . you marines are a weepy bunch of motherfuckers . . you get a chance to bowl in that tournament . ?
that ' s stupid .
it ' s true . some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring . if you eat a whole lot of it , it gives you bionic strength .
what did goering say ?
he told me to be careful as one of goebbels ' men was watching me . he read a report on me - everything i said was quoted word by word .
oh , i wish you ' d forget about that . it was all so long ago . i ' ve totally gotten over it .
<person> , okay .
<person> ' s play it now !

i have to talk to you , alone , j . j . , that ' s why .
if he ' s really the one , you can find out the rest of his plan .
how ?
why would he be frightened ?
i don ' t know . but it was weird in terms of what happened next . <person> was still watching his mother . <continued_utterance> i shut the door with one hand , and released the brake with the other , and waited for a second for <person> to cross in front of the bus . there was a sixteen wheeler behind me , and i heard his air brakes hiss as the driver chunked into gear . i looked into the side view mirror , and saw him move into line behind me . then suddenly <person> shrieked .
have you no shame ?
oooh . oh . <person> . <person> .
i ' ve only got two . it ' s dead around here . <continued_utterance> well , i ' ve got this one guy , a tourist . he had a heart attack on a cable car .
looks like he left his heart in san francisco .
yes ?
oh , this is mr . <person> . he drove us in from <person> last night . he .
erm .
come on . <continued_utterance> come on , come on , come on . <person> ' s go on the dance floor . one song .
why should i give you the keys ?
because the company ' s played ball with you long enough . because you ' re three payments behind . and because we ' ve got a court order .
that ' s professor <person> to you <person> !
give it up , professor . you ' ll never catch me !
words .
what kind of words ?
thanks . how was rehearsal ?
awful . we have five hundred and sixty lighting cues . i don ' t know why i made it so complicated .
i never had a real home . <person> was always where my mom was . <continued_utterance> is this you ?
that was when i went with the relief group to shadda-bi-boran . their sun was imploding , and the planet was dying . i was helping to relocate the children . see that little one i ' m holding ? his name was n ' a-kee-tula , which means sweethear . he was so full of life , . all those kids were . i did everything i could to save him , but he died . they all did . they were never able to adapt . to live off their native planet . <continued_utterance> my first day as an apprentice legislator . notice the difference ?
you sound defensive .
i ' m fine .
<person> my relief . so what ' s for dinner ?
why in the world would she t .

<person> went on a river trip . <person> was a guide . <continued_utterance> those are e-mails between <person> and <person> discussing the trip one year ago .
well , you must have been really bored .
i was .
how ' s mr . <person> ?
he got off light . with a broken wrist and fifty stitches . <person> man .
i want to stop taking those pills .
i wish you wouldn ' t .
i have a wonderful idea ! i can take him out in the car and when i get to a lonely spot , knock him on the head with a hammer , pour gasoline over him and over the car and start the whole thing ablaze .
and then have to walk all that way home ? <continued_utterance> no , i have the best way , and the best tools . <person> , silent , and quick . the silent part being the most important . let me show you what i mean .
yes . i mean , no . i mean , maybe he would find her , i mean you attractive . maybe he doesn ' t like to dance . maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don ' t dance either .
maybe it doesn ' t matter if he ' s a good dancer cause it ' s a slow song , if that ' s what he ' s afraid of .
his father ' s a shiite . we ' re checking him out .
<person> this out , pal . his father ' s a federal agent for ten years .
to reveal he ' s holding a football .
<person> !
<person> .
<person> .
<person> told me .
oh , i bet you saw her when you were over playing with <person> the other day , right ? she was there then ?
go ahead . you ' re safe . there ' re thirty cops in this building .
<person> .
out of the question .
<person> let me try . i ' m begging you .
i don ' t have a girl-friend .
live wire like you ? you surprise me .
one possible future . four your point of view . i don ' t know the tech stuff .
and you ' re from the future too ?
hey . !
little more juice ' s all it needs .
captain . perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony .
i ' m not going . <person> , help me with this chute .
most people don ' t notice . this is from his prison series . he could see a mango grove through his cell window . he made some of the pigments himself . from flowers .
what was his crime ?
what have the kids told him about us ?
i don ' t tell that . i save that for blackmail .
so what -- it ' s my fault ? ! i let the sex go out of our marriage ! i deserve what i got . thanks for understanding .
<person> , i ' m sorry . that ' s not what --
ok .
what ' s my name again ?
<person> -- it ' s so much more complicated than you can imagine .
i know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but i ' m just a big pile of love today -- and i feel bad for the guy . he said he ' s been writing you -- but you never responded .
we ' re in a convent ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve got to go .
just remember - you ' re a target . <person> ' t you think <person> has a t . v . ?
what are you doing in the ship ? <person> ?
getting food . we were out of food .
smoke . <person> . i ' ve heard stuff about a death squad . a group a guys loyal to the hardline school . guys that ' ve had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks , suspending cops right and left , tying their hands . while outa the other side a their mouths these same people ' re squealing save us , save us , do something you fucking morons , crime is totally out of control .
<person> .
what ' s wrong ?
gibarian . he was here .
what ' ve you got ?
they meet on main street . her horse has just died . he ' s coming from the fire .
nope . i ' m just supposed to hold people ' s hands while they die . what ' d you say your problem was ?
i just swore my life away , back in that .
my condolences .
what are you pouring tonight ?
well , if anything like this happens again , we should go talk to <person> .
<person> .
you should watch that !
in fact the only thing which looks like <person> is you .
it ought to be . unless it was very recent . i hate to say it , but it looks like the system you ' re searching for doesn ' t exist .
that ' s impossible . perhaps the archives are incomplete .
cuz , dummy they ' re canadian , just like <person> !
oh .
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles .
tell me , <person> . what are you afraid of ?
<person> !
ok , a hundred bucks .
<person> , i told you -
j . j . , i swear to you on my mother ' s life , i won ' t do it . if you gave me your column i wouldn ' t do a thing like that . but as he speaks the last words , <person> ' s voice falters because he has glanced down at the table .
yes .
so if i gave you my life , what would you do with it ? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now ? or could you change ? could you try to remember a mother ' s touch you never felt ? a father ' s words you never heard ? could you do that ?
so there never was a death squad .
<person> .
<person> ? and maybe shorter habits , and women priests , and sleeping late ?
<person> ' t push it .
not a lot , sweetie . it ' s a country .
where are you , anyway ?
because you don ' t have the balls . did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude ? you serve your country . is there anything else ? hub would love to just . clock him . instead:
i said i wasn ' t in politics . i ' m not . i ' m in law enforcement . <continued_utterance> <person> , you are under arrest for the torture and murder of <person> under color of authority , united states <person> <number> , <person> <number> , <person> <number> , sections
you didn ' t say that about the food ?
i was just in the cafeteria , there ' s plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .
<person> me , <person> . i said namely you shouldn ' t go around wild , blaming people without justification .
i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated .
did you reach the next girl yet ?
no . <person> getting an answer- ing machine .
then why the rat ?
cause i ' m tired of bein ' his nigger . i want you to help me break him .
it ' s private .
you ' re kidding , right ? tell me what happened , you fucker , or i ' ll tie your dick in a knot .
i ' m pretty busy , as you can see .
that ' s no excuse . you read the script , didn ' t you ?
no , no , no . you were doing fine , you ' d been courteous and receptive to courtesy , you ' d established trust with the embarrassing truth about <person> , and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire . it won ' t do . it ' s stupid and boring .
i ' m only asking you to look at this , <person> . either you will or you won ' t .
just curious .
i like them . i ' ve always liked them . i ' m just a turtleneck kinda gal .
<person>s . jimmy pig starts chopping furiously .
do what you can . <continued_utterance> they ' re gon na kill us anyhow . no point in surrendering . <person> !
eighty million dollars ? i swear to you .
then what about the wallet , huh ? why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board ?
i ' m sorry , iris . i didn ' t mean that .
you ' re not much with girls , are you ?
give the word , admiral .
mr . <person> , the word is given .
just a couple of hours . it ' ll be fun --
excuse me . what part of no don ' t you understand ?
the senator from naboo .
who hired you ?
ya know what ? i ' m getting extremely tired of hearing that word . in fact , that ' s gon na be policy from now on . no zero .
<person> , profile the guy . he ' s straight outta quantico . all he ' s doing is working a case , like we would . he ' s not kidnapping little kids - he ' s chasing the guy who ' s doing the kidnapping ! look at the map !
that ' s fine .
that ' s a dollar forty-seven .
' <person> birthday , dear <person> , love <person> . ' or words to that effect . that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying , ' <person> , <person> , you win . you ' re the number one man . have a swell party . '
i have no idea what you ' re talking about .
<person> . i ' ll think about that . bye .
you really should . <person> , after all , is really just a series of challenges .
really ?
i miss you , <person> .
can i ask you a personal question ?
sure .
who ' s there ?
junior .
nine .
you can be there at seven .
it could be worse .
it ' s worse .
then you must know <person> sido- dryas ?
<person> , close the door . <continued_utterance> <person> who ?
you like my play .
yes .
learn about the force , luke .
<person> , i can take you as far as anchorhead . you can get a transport there to mos eisley or wherever you ' re going .
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back . <person> , you can ' t do anything to make her want to come back . you can only do things to make her not want to come back .
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her .
<person> ' s <person> .
who ' s got him ?
ten k .
i lose more than that running for the bus . i ' l l do it for a caravan .
<person> , i ' ll be back by midnight i ' m sure --
whenever .
it can . ordinary matter , like ours ? not affected . everything else , disintegrates . <continued_utterance> what i ' m saying is : <person> ' t trust anyone . find yourself a weapon of some sort .
i can trust <person> .
i couldn ' t . do you know how hard it ' s been not to call you ? i pick up the phone every night . whenever that commercial comes on .
. the micheline commercial .
you know , us .
i thought you met someone else .
when ?
he wants cash so he ' s coming back after he has been to a fight .
every day . you know , it ' s weird -- i haven ' t cried very much at all . maybe you ' re only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and i used mine up .
yeah . i know how you feel `cause , my college boyfriend broke up with me last year . and i miss him all the time .
no .
they ' re damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes , but i wouldn ' t trade having them for anything . <continued_utterance> what do you think of america ?
i don ' t think it ' s a good idea you going in at all .
unless you are going to transcendentally extract the passports and cash from out of a steel safe , i can ' t see any other way of getting them . keep your eyes peeled . <continued_utterance> well i can ' t see anyone . after i have got in go round the front and call me if you see anything .
do you remember when you first got here ? we used to talk all night long . until the sun came up . we would just lie in bed and talk .
that ' s because i wanted to fuck you , dumbass ! now hows aboot you get those pants down !
what do you mean ? they ' re sending someone from rome ?
that ' s good , isn ' t it ?
thanks . i owe it all to you .
not all . just forty percent . <continued_utterance> i spent the best years of my life playing in the states . <person> gives you a lot of opportunities , but baseball only gives you one . <person> every minute of it . <continued_utterance> how ' s your new curve ?
i call him a fartface or a pervert , or something equally lame .
you have to ignore him . <continued_utterance> he ' s not even there . you don ' t see him , you don ' t hear him , you ' re just too much of a woman to bother with little boys .
believe me , we ' ve put every resource we ' ve got onto that very question . otherwise . we wait .
we wait .
that song by <person> , where it ' s said <person> a pusher , party truth , partly ficition , a walking contradiction .

that ' s where the popcorn business comes in . you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears .
<person> . the last writer ' s retreat i stayed at kind of froze my balls off , you know ?
oh .
in silhouette , a man is fucking a nurse .
so , mrs . <person> whips out a shotgun and blows his ass to kingdom come . <continued_utterance> <person> said , because the majority of women in lincoln county having babies don ' t bring a shotgun , it counted as premeditation . <continued_utterance> then there ' s <person> . <continued_utterance> geek extraordinaire - a walking left brain . she ' s supposed to have this genius i . q . ? <continued_utterance> truth is , she ' s an obsessive-compulsive little freak .

was it a gift . ?
this is an important night for us . finally someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made . that you have put everything second , including me , for those families they ' re talking about . <continued_utterance> they ' re also saying that my husband has a gift . not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence . or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas . your gift teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would piss on themselves . yes , i believe what they wrote about you .
thank you . <continued_utterance> what are we hugging about again ?
here .
let me have the money . <continued_utterance> you better stick that other in here too , if you wanta keep it .
this is totally different . i ' m talking about avoiding what you ' re talking about . that ' s the distinction . i have not made the commitment yet . i am not married . i have not said the words . in a few days , i might get married , and if i do , then i won ' t be doing stuff like this anymore . <person> , what ' s the whole point of getting married ?
and what about <person> ? she ' s a woman -- with a kid . a single mom . what do you think she ' s looking for ? huh ?

you ' re upset , that ' s alright .

i ' ll knock em dead . but you ' ve got to be careful in prison . you have to use condoms .

what assurance do we have you ' ll be able to read the screen before the device detonates ?
my mother always says that violence never solves anything .
really ? i wonder what the city fathers of <person> would have to say about that . you . <person> points at carmen .
<person> ? <person> what ?
<person> what a fraud he was . <continued_utterance> no , but i do like to think about the life of wine , how it ' s a living thing . i like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing , how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained . what the weather was like . i think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes , and if it ' s an old wine , how many of them must be dead by now . i love how wine continues to evolve , how every time i open a bottle it ' s going to taste different than if i had opened it on any other day . because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it ' s constantly evolving and gaining complexity . that is , until it peaks -- like your ' <number> -- and begins its steady , inevitable decline . and it tastes so fucking good .
she looks like my third grade teacher . i hated my third grade teacher . hold it ! wait a minute ! she is my third grade teacher !

well then . only one way to go .
could i ? <person> , last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley . so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch . this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax . now if <person> had been elected -

to hell with fate .
<person> again , <person> ?
no , no . of course , that ' s exactly what it represents .
that whole .
i wouldn ' t worry about money .
maybe i ' d better take the rest of the script home and read it -
oh come off it .
what ?
we are not going through this exercise again , <person> . you will pay attention to my lead .
why ?
i ' ll give you the money to go . i don ' t want you to take any from those guys .
you don ' t have to .
i ' d rather be with <person> .
she ' s

at the finish , it ' s <person> by two , <person> second , visitation third . <person> on <person> . <number> to <number> . <person> with it , that ' s no good .
some honeymoon .
we have time . come to bed .
how would you have it work ?
we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems , agree what ' s in the best interests of all the people , and then do it .
sure .
i have nothing to do . i ' d like to help you .
the five quid you are going to pay me .
oh fuck off , i ' ll find him myself .
<person> means you accept . <continued_utterance> part of me hasn ' t quit yet . and the other part is still pretty outraged . when it ' s not terrified . <continued_utterance> i ' m thinking . do i know you well enough to really chew you out ?
no .
you can ' t leave him on his own , not to begin with , he gets homesick .
<person> , for fucks sake .
that ' s good , isn ' t it ?
no , but i thought that didn ' t happen in italy , that each region was completely separate ! i was <continued_utterance> it ' s ridiculous but now you ' ve mentioned the stench i can hardly breathe .
this is how it starts . next thing you know . we ' re only having sex three or four times a week .
most people consider that normal .
i want to spend the night together .
i have no problem with that .
black-and-whites on the scene ?
setting up a perimeter now .
. and if you are approached to buy drugs , let someone you trust know . if you are thinking of harming yourself or others , let someone know . if it burns when you urinate , have milky seepage or are being touched by an uncle - let someone know .
the a-squad performed . <continued_utterance> now , i know it ' s my duty to give you all the facts , so i have to say that their cheer blew like a bulimic after <person> dinner . their blatant disregard for national high school cheerleading association rules made me sick . `` basket toss flips and wolf wall pyramids over two people high are strictly prohibited . `` i made a complete report and sent it in .
yes -- spock is satisfied ; he fights for breath --
<person> ' t grieve , admiral -- it ' s logical : the good of the many outweighs --
<person> .
<person> ?
i don ' t know anything about bodies ! i mean , he didn ' t bring it home . he was good to me . sometimes . he was sweet . he took care of me . who am i supposed to go out with ? he owns a casino . he let me sing .
he didn ' t do you a favor .
<person> ' s too slippery for books , <person> . <person> and swans came from the same god . tell me , <person> - was she a large girl ?
yes .
i don ' t know . i suppose until they find out who did it .
we ' ll be happier then , won ' t we ?
well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong . it was
well , why does it ?
<person> , please -- this is a grown- up apartment now .
i guess i didn ' t realize how big i was until i saw it on your faces .
who then ?
<person> .
<person> , where ' s <person> ?
still ? she ' s gone , <person> . long gone . now go . <person> .
check your driver ' s license .
<person> . got it . <person> , the way i see it , i ' m stuck here , right ? i mean , i ' m here or i ' m target practice . so here ' s the deal -- i don ' t bug you , you don ' t bug me . i ' ll catch up on some sleep , watch some tube , lay back and lay low . so just get me a key and show me to my room , and do not disturb . <person> ?
you ' re upset . i understand . i should go . i hate to . <person> <number> .
<person> out of here ! and never come back !
that ' s impossible .
i ' m look at his whole history ! citations , letters of commendation , even his fucking test scores from quantico .
i ' m sorry again about the .
no , don ' t . it ' s fine .
<person>entors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like .
<person> ' t get me wrong . obi-wan is a great mentor . as wise as <person>aster yoda and as powerful as <person>aster windu . i am truly thankful to be his apprentice . only . although i ' m a padawan learner , in some ways . a lot of ways . i ' m ahead of him . i ' m ready for the trials . i know i am ! he knows it too . he believes i ' m too unpredictable . other <person> my age have gone through the trials and made it . i know i started my training late . but he won ' t let me move on .
it ' s not sucking , sir .
thank you , i can see that . <person> something else .
what are you doing here ?
can we talk a minute ?
well . it seems we ' re truly sailing into the unknown . <person> at it . anything you can give me would be appreciated . dismissed .
at present he serves no useful function . dr . <person> created us to become active and useful members of society . i do not believe he would have wanted the b- <number> to live out his life in his present state .
and you know all this . because <continued_utterance> you ' re an entertaining man , <person> . but you ' re also full of shit .
actually,
that might not be so bad . at least for you .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
yeah . the end is built in to the beginning . what can you do ?
god . you ' re just perfect .
good . <person> . i ' ll be in new york with <person> , i can squeeze it in . she types in becky ' s idea .
you want to hear about destiny ? if my husband hadn ' t gone on a diet , which caused me to leave him , i would never have been on that flight to miami , and met <person> , and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a <number> with that nob you slide that says `` vacant-occupied , vacant- occupied , vacant-occupied '' --
to indie drummers ? maybe . who are your influences , <person> ?
everyone asks that . this your place ?
welfare , mam ? i think the senator ' s right . people should work for a living . i do . i like to work . every day . get those old coots off welfare and make ' em work for a change .
well , that ' s not exactly what the senator has proposed . you might not want to canvass , but there is plenty more other work we need done : office work , filing , poster hanging .
that ' s a swell idea . now go look on top of the fridge , where i keep the mr . boston . i ' ll wait .
you okay ? except for being thirsty ?
depends on what kind they are -- ' specially when they ' re under lock and key .
you ' re taking those , i presume .
what are you talking about ?
the binoculars that grampa ' s gon na get me for my birthday .
<person> night as they exit . their backs to <person> , daughter following mother . <person> speaks to her daughter .

how ' s forrester ?
oh , shit .
<person> .

<person> this up your .
<person> . <person> tries to speak ; she can ' t . <continued_utterance> <person> . is there a problem ? with the coat ?
okay , what about you ?
<person> .
my friends call it the shrine . it can be difficult to let go .
i know .
<person> . you see all this after you leave the train ?
yeah . just for a split second .
sure . every bunco man in the country knows <person> .
there ' s word he ' s gon na run a con on the north side here . we got a year-old florida warrant on him , but it ' s a thin beef , and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold . all we want you to do is pick up <person> for us .
<person> , i ' ve been cooperating . i even drew you a picture . you can ' t put your responsibility on me . you have a badge , not me .
if somebody else dies , and you know you could have done more to stop it , you ' re going to feel like shit for a very long time , mr . <person> .
well , i ' ll be at the academy next season . after that who knows . i won ' t be drafted into the imperial starfleet that ' s for sure . <person> care of yourself , you ' ll always be the best friend i ' ve got .
so long , <person> .
why would you help me ?
i like you , theo . you bowl with soul . <continued_utterance> but , now that you mention it , you could afford me one minor dispensation . theo follows his gaze to the screen . <continued_utterance> while you ' re in town , i need you to keep an eye on my daughter for a couple of days . her big brother broke out of the mental hospital . theo ' s eyes glaze over , the lights in the office dim , and <person> seems to recede into the far distance .
<person> to murder , <person> .
only the finest minds in the mumbai police force . <continued_utterance> go check the files , constable . <continued_utterance> you puzzle me , <person> . admitting murder to avoid a charge of fraud is not exactly clever thinking . now , why would you do that ?
well , i just wanted to say . what i said . <continued_utterance> uhhhh .
i can ' t sleep upstairs with you . just can ' t for now .
i ' m looking for a christmas present for my daughter . something pink .

you ' re a real pal . my indiana <person> . i won ' t forget how you came to my rescue again .
they hardly impressed me as the gang bang type , <person> . now much coke have you done ?
you ' ve heard of it ?
it ' s all the other girls seem to talk about . this is my first year , but <continued_utterance> <person> <number> of <number> apparently it ' s a pretty big deal . being from oceanside , you should have a good chance .
<person> . so what do we do now ? ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?
it is nine p . m . pleasant dreams .
well , i think we ' re reaching the point of diminishing returns here , right ? certainly it ' s learning more about us than we ' ll ever learn about it .
but why is it doing what it ' s doing ? given it ' s resources , it could have done anything . presented me with your double , and you with mine .
no , no no ! ! it ' ll be okay . stay with us !
i have to go away , <person> .
ain ' t made up my mind yet .
i understand you ' re a man who knows how to get things .
oh no ! tell us stories of movie stars tying up their children and being cruel .
i wish .
i live there .

`` <person> ? '' -- can ' t now , <person> . i ' m late . i was looking all over for you . keep an eye on the kids . you know my secret cell number .
just give me a moment to talk here .
all he wants is the attention . when he can ' t get to you , he ' ll try harder for a little while . then , he ' ll give up . it ' ll be no fun .
you think <person> would do that ? <continued_utterance> it ' s just she ' s younger . maybe she remembers how to do this . <continued_utterance> this ' ll work , huh ?
<person> on , lem me , i got ta get my bearings here . who is this again ?
<person> , i got ta get back to work , was there anything else you told me to do after i came out of it ?
well , i ' m afraid it ' s not that easy .
why not ?
no we ' re not . you feeling okay ?
i don ' t think i ' ve slept one night since i ' ve been home . every little ache and pain scares the shitout of me . can ' t get a handle on my emotional life , don ' t know what i want , don ' t know if what i felt was because i just had a heart attack or was real . <person> , i feel needy . i never used that word in my life .
what ' s that supposed to mean ?
`what ' s that supposed to mean ? '
oh , come now , <person> . why should i go to metcalf and kill a total stranger , unless it was part of the plan and you were in on it ? you ' re the one that benefits , <person> . you ' re a free man . i didn ' t even know the girl .
let me go , <person> . i had nothing to do with this and the police will believe me . <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .

a friend is a person that is good to you . someone you like to be with . someone you like to laugh with .
he was a good friend . the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship .
my head hurts .

surely he must be dead by now .
i never use mine . but it ' s a good thing to have . just as a threat .
well , if there ' s this many hackies inside , there must be lots of hares outside . and i ' m gon na hustle ' em .

not really but it looks like it says eleven .
it is eleven .
well , there ' s a price on my head . if i don ' t pay off jabba the hut , i ' m a dead man .
a death mark ' s not an easy thing to live with . you ' re a good fighter , <person> . i hate to lose you .
that ' s very sweet of you <person> -

<person> --

but good words . that ' s where ideas begin . maybe you should listen to them .
i ' m trying , <person> .
it ' s cute . it ' s like a little clue . <continued_utterance> so he can ' t write . big deal . i mean , verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy , and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble .

these attacks will show you that you will never be safe . you can secure your borders . but what can you do against one of your own citizens ? one who looks like you , who is blameless , living already among you , who takes eighty million of our dollars , a trifle , and carries out our bidding ? you can not stop this . <person> has run out .
you pig !
<person> , it ' s not me ! i love you ! it ' s god !

i don ' t see a control panel . or an access port .
it appears to be a magnetically sealed . <person> steps forward and opens a small panel on wrist and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within . <continued_utterance> i believe i can reverse the polarity by attenuating my axial servo . <continued_utterance> `` open sesame . ``
it doesn ' t work around you . my mind is always a muddle . i can only think of you .
<person> , don ' t .
you gon na get yourself killed for this ? this toxic-waste bitch !
what the fuck are you doing ? !
if <person> was completed , it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground .
<person> of what ?
no it doesn ' t .
<person> knew somebody was after her .
i remember the bus swerved , it just suddenly swerved to the right , and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road , and then it went over the embankment there , and everyone was screaming and everything . and that ' s all . i guess i was unconscious after that . that ' s all . then i was in the hospital .
do you have any questions , mr . <person> ?
it aint . it aint mine , my erm , my mate left it , he left it here . i could phone him if you want , he ' ll sort you out .
where d ' you get your fucking weed from rude boy ?
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig .
everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime , it ' s what we are . but now the risks are outa line . the streets are a war zone . and sex can kill you . so you slip on the trodes , you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks .

he ' d have all your memories too .
oh , <person> was the big miracle for a long time . but i think i ' d like to try life without any miracles for a while .
well , having your first byline , and losing the love of your life in the same night has a certain ' the gods must be laughing at me ' feeling .
cows have only been domesticated in the last eight thousand years , before that they were running around mad as lorries . the human digestive system ' `` ' hasn ' t got used to any dairy products yet , it takes a lot longer than that .
well fuck me <person> , what have you been reading ?

we have nothing to talk about , <person> .
<person> , make sure mr . <person> gets safely to his car .
but everything that ' s happening is good ! you can be a part of it !
a part of what ? <person> , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party . <continued_utterance> page <number> . <continued_utterance> you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how . fortunate .

that ' s good .
you ' re the inventor of this thing .
i prefer the term project designer . and sorry for all the secrecy . <person> will be thrilled you re- established contact .
you ever get hot ?
no .
why don ' t you pick him up yourself ?
cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin ' him . if word gets around that feds are in on it too , <person> ' ll fold up the whole thing .
you ' re doin ' great , <person> . he loves ya .
into the far turn , it ' s <person> now by half a length , war <person> is second by two , <person> is third by a half and moving fast on the outside . <person> is fourth by four lengths , followed by <person> , <person> ' end and <person> . <continued_utterance> coming down the stretch , it ' s <person> by one length , war <person> and <person> are neck and neck by two . now it ' s <person> , <person> and war <person> . <person> and <person> head to head . <continued_utterance> <person> , <person> . <person> , <person> . it ' s <person> by a nose . <person> is second by two , war <person> third by three and a half . time for a mile and <number> / <number> , <number> : <number> and <number> / <number> seconds .

but he ' ll own it . so . you are keeping your own place , right ?
it ' s never happening again .
right .
<person> and goering were sure heaping honours on you . one makes you a privy councillor , the other makes you vice-president of the chamber of music , and you weren ' t even a member of the party , how do you explain that ?
well , there was a constant battle between goering and <person> as to which of them would control german culture . i was simply a pawn . <person> , i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as <person> of the <person> philharmonic orchestra . in <number> .

no , it ' s not like that . he just got off work -- he ' s a waiter .
<person> , i may not get texts and i may not send texts -- but trust me : the sub-text of that text : <person> .
it ' s just <person> ' s way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there . consider it a rookie initiation .
<person> .
i was .
<person> , we ' ve got a problem . your sister can not be taking the bus anywhere . ok . i know a guy who owns a car rental company . we ' re gon na get you a car , we ' re going to drive around in circles in a parking lot and you are going to learn how to drive . <continued_utterance> not a stick , automatic . it ' s a little easier .

and who was , regrettably , also your best fucking friend .
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
mmm .

yeah , i mean , i don ' t know . i feel okay mostly . fucking might help .
the damage was considerable . but she ' s insured . thanks , again .

what ' s wrong ?
just sickness . . hey , you can ' t take the pretenders ' first album . that ' s mine .

well , maybe you weren ' t .
i don ' t want you to die .

hey , hey , slow up , <person> has to take down what you say .
<person> ? any relation to colonel joachim <person> ?
i don ' t know , <person> . perhaps it ' s because i feel attacked .
i ask you one simple question , and suddenly i ' m attacking you .
that ' s gon na take a long time !
time ? did time matter to the revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze king ?
i saw it with my own eyes . we ' ve killed an extraterrestrial and .
is there any possibility that it ' s a hoax ? could you be mistaken ?
uh , excuse me , sir , but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago , and he seems to have left his wallet behind , and we were wondering .
<person> , yeah . like that . just like that .
no , sh- he stops himself . she looks at him .
what ? he shakes his head . maggie what ?
i think your boyfriend is winning .
yes . yes , he is .
sure , <person> .
but not no more . now people take advantage . <person> ain ' t what it used to be . there ' s something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
he rooms behind his office down the street . <person> ' t usually pull up the blinds till around noon , though .
he will this morning . see you later , old-timer .
<person> , the rugs !
oh , shut up !
no . <person> . must . destroy mcp . first .
<person> ! where ' s <person> ? where ' s <person> ?
they were jews , they had to leave . they were right to leave . i could not leave my country in her deepest misery . after all , i am a german . i . i stayed in my homeland . is that my sin in your eyes ?

commander .
<person> , sir . there is too much interference in the planet ' s ionosphere for an accurate reading .
only yes and no . you ' re a bit .
for sure .
a note ? that ' s a little chilly .
i ' m embarrassed . i just haven ' t been myself lately . what can i say ?
sure , that ' ll be fine . <continued_utterance> do you have anything smaller ?
yes , but i ' m afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet . perhaps you ' d be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables .
<person> it was late .
yeah . to be honest , people were starting to get seriously pissed off . <person> , i ' ve got to go tell everyone the drinks are here . <person> ' t go anywhere . promise ?
no , he ' s totally too young for me . but we ' re just having dinner . it ' s not a date .

not significant .
fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it ! fuck it !
you can do it in my mouth .
where ' s <person> ?
i sent her to the party . i figured i ' d wait up here until you killed <person> .
the other girls are in the ground . exhumations are upsetting for the families . i ' ll do it if i have to , but -
then have the lab check <person> ' s head . dr . <person> ' s patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues . they ' ll find another cocoon .
you have a wonderful mother .
<person> ?
is that really what you want ?
i want to stop taking those pills .
her chaperone . my lady ' s country cousin . my , but you be a handsome gallant , just as she said ! you may call me <person> !
on a more fortuitous occasion , perhaps
you sure have . can ' t shut you up about your bettys .
that ' s right . now , i mean i ' m no authority on young girls . or am i ? that was kinda creepy .
i often take something snacky down to <person> at this time of day . i know how the brain needs feeding .
<person> . the last writer ' s retreat i stayed at kind of froze my balls off , you know ?

<person> deal .
what are you going on about ?
is that why the card failed .
<person> , you had the vision to build that ship when no one else on this planet could see beyond their own problems . you flew that ship . all i did was push a few buttons .
all right . and don ' t worry -- i ' ll keep your secret .
uh unh .
come on , <person> . come on , buddy . <person> . <continued_utterance> alright . we ' re going up .
<person> , we ' re gon na carry you .
<person> , i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it ' s too late . gimmee the nuke .
what are you talking about ?
i forgot to get a wax .
<person> ? where are you ? it ' s over . i found him .
who are you talking to ?
i ' ll check . you want blubber , right ?
yeah . <continued_utterance> my parents are coming to town . you know how parents are . they ' ll drive you nuts .
what happened ?
he said he loved me and all -- but didn ' t think i was `` the one '' . <continued_utterance> and that hurt . but -- you know -- whatever . i ' m not going to give up on love .
please .
i don ' t know , <person> . it ' s so good like it is . why don ' t we just live together first ?
fantastic ! there was this new wrestler . beat the mighty <person> . you won ' t believe it . a nothing of a guy . calls himself this stupid name . the amazing spider-man . would you believe it ?
spider-man , huh ? well , maybe i ' ll just go and wrestle myself one of these days . with all my new arms . i ' m sure i can beat <person> or any other monster . <continued_utterance> will i beat him , this <person> , will i beat him or not ?
you ' re an imposter .
officer , your honor , your eminence , dr . <person> cave me the keys to his brownstone . <person> ' t that so ?
<person> , is that an old zeiss ? <continued_utterance> porro prism ?
eight by thirty <person> . no marks on the objectives . <person> bloom .
<person> , i am not going back . i ' m staying here with you .
then you ' ll die .

please . <continued_utterance> <person> is it , are you a runner or chaser ?
thank you . <person> , is , uh --
well , of course he is !
i went for a walk .
no you didn ' t . you took the car .
why was there no warning from <person> ?
because he didn ' t know anything .
your name ?
<person> . <person> .
i can ' t believe what i just did . i innocently go to buy the nightgown and this amazing blonde salesgirl starts coming on to me . we wind up doing it standing up in front of a three-way mirror in the dressing room . <continued_utterance> if <person> would just marry me , i know i wouldn ' t do stuff like that -- it would be a legal violation .
as opposed to tonight ' s standing violation . you think marriage is going to make you faithful ?
and i just want to know if i ' m crazy or not -- if what i think is happening is actually happening . or am i one of those people , those women , who are blind to what ' s going on ? who pretend not to see their husband ' s attention toward another woman ?
let ' s go home .
yeah , didn ' t you have a date , or something ?
oh , she no es my girl .
well . we all grow up sometime . he not drop a tray of dishes in days . something going right . you think he ready ?
i guess we ' ll both find out on sunday . i sure hope so .
i heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength .
that ' s stupid .
no .
of course , when we return , we ' ll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth . we ' ll chalk it up to isolation , collective derangement .
motion sickness , i ' m afraid . i believe i will get off at the next stop .
<person> well .
thanks .
<person> ' t give up . you ' re going to make it .
it was kind of like clicking , maybe a language wasn ' t it ?
listen to this . a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning . when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange ' clicking gibberish ' .
<person> ?
my mom .
not this time .
do you want to stay here ?
this is important .
that why the barbies are watching ?
did you see the lawyer ?
called him . we set an ap .
not my first date , <person> . he ' s taking the bqe . <person> like it ' s brooklyn .
i want husbands and wives , i want baby carriages , and no brooks brothers .
the boy had jumped from above .
we just missed it by minutes .
you have class tonight ?
mortgage lenders and financing .
<person> !
yeah , yeah , the matrix is badass . i was like , <person> ? what ?
where are you ?
where do you think . i ' m on site .
that ' s what nightscopes are for , soldier . for the dark .
yes , sir . but the sixth rule is `` never give the enemy an advantage unnecessarily . `` if they ' re expecting us --
you kiss like a spanish fly . joking around . i don ' t know what i ' m talking about .
yes you do .
get off me .
ah come on , come on , come on , come on , come on .
i ' m sorry . i ' m quiet . <person> how quiet i am . you can barely hear me .
my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact .
yes , i ate . i ate the sushi that i hand made for you . the sushi that i planned to lay all over my naked body as a valentines surprise for you .
why are you so upset ? i called .
<person> , before we get into numbers , i want you to try a taste . i got a deck with me .
what ? right here ?
yes , but .
you got your camera ?
this is about an arrest made yesterday at the waverly movie theater - the clerk checks the records .
this precinct didn ' t do any business at the waverly theater .
he wouldn ' t do that .
making himself all cosy in your house . going through your stuff , prob ' ly wearing your fucking pants -
i want you here .
you ' re lying .
it just bled .
i ' ve got to do the house up before i sell it . it looks like an eighties timewarp . would you like the job ? <continued_utterance> painting it and tidying the garden ?
back to the drawing board , i guess . or not . so . you ' re married . congratulations . you look happy .
i am .
is that why the card failed .
what ?
. do you know how much trouble you ' re in . ?
yes . and that ' s the difference between you and me .
that mcp , you know , that ' s half the problem right --
the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do . i can ' t sit and
is there a problem ?
no , sir .
what ' s the other news ? <continued_utterance> oh my god --
i ' m moving back to st . <person> -- we are getting married in the fall .
you know what i want .
you ' re like some crazy man- you ' re obsessed .
we ' re picking up a distress call , captain .
on speakers .
and cole , next time i won ' t be late for you .
next time i won ' t be scared of you .
i think it ' s going to be a real fun . event .
<person> . bye .
there is the bathroom . i put in soap and a toothbrush .
thanks . <person> , she ' s quite a character , that <person> .
what does your gut tell you ?
i know but -- smith stayed with me through chemo . if he could stay with me through that , i should be able to stay in this relationship for him .
<person> , you big yellow turd !
he just wants attention . you don ' t play with him like you used to . <person> concentrates for a moment .
i t ' s lucky you . got me <person> , it could have been one of the other lads , and then think how much trouble you ' d be in .
you come through that door and you ' ll be going out prostrate .
<person> tho ' -- first the k . c . foreman -- then <person> -- an ' now these women .
<person> -- you ain ' t thinkin ' somebody might try bumpin ' them ?
all right . truth . i believe that one . why is it so urgent you couldn ' t wait until morning ?
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon .
no , no , i ' m sure , but -- you understand . it should only be a couple of days . what ' s the thing you ' re working on ?
it ' s called <person> . it ' s a security program itself , actually . monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems . if it finds anything going on that ' s not scheduled , it shuts it down . i sent you a memo on it .
i ' m sorry . i think you ' re a terrific woman . i just don ' t think we should see each other anymore .
why not ? and tell me the truth .
he says my dad ' s back in jail again .
ah , i ' m sorry , man .
<person> , mr . <person> . you ' d be surprised .
i attended two . <person> and mother of good counsel . i remember <person> . and . i don ' t know , <person> . mr . <person> . oh , and mrs . <person> , she had a glass eye .
an interesting definition . but it is not one that applies to me . i am completely artificial . i have no organic components .
have you ever wondered what it ' s like to have flesh ?
i ' m supposed to dig .
who says ?
what about us ?
i ' m prepared to take the blame .
the cops and company raise hell they find out .
truck drivers bring up harlem specials that blow up in your hand . but this guy don ' t deal no shit . just quality . if you ever need anything , i can put you in touch .
i hear ya hands . i see ya hands .
he ' s got it .
<person> .
<person> ?
what shit , honey ?
you don ' t want to hear about it .
no , seriously , how did you get it ?
i used to play this game with my cousin .
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me . <continued_utterance> do i really feel like . i am . ?
yes . yes .
the man who shot at you .
who was he ?
what are you talking about ?
i ' m not going through this again <person> , don ' t fucking lie to me .
i ' m such an asshole .
she wasn ' t your type anyway .
well , i ' m tired . <person> ' t you tired ?
the chick digs you . she lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published .
i beg your pardon ?
i quit .
<person> ' musta gone wrong -- we better fan out and see what ' s goin ' on .
but , madam --
you don ' t want to know .
i think i do .
i take it back . we ' re going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer .
i ' m not going to argue with that .
i , uh . i ' m leaving .
why ?
billy , that ' s too early .
she said she ' s got to be home by nine .
<person> , i don ' t do that anymore .
you used to dance .
which one ' s <person> ?
the one where they bang the chicks on the bus . thirteen bucks a month . <person> access , live web <person> feed . the works . it ' ll be like i ' m on the bus , banging them myself .
oh , that ' s for <person> . so , <person> tells me you ' re a butcher . <person> ' s talk meat .
<person> , no one wants to talk shop . especially butcher shop .
what ?
may i have the honor ?
we could go into hadditon , get a meal .
yes but . what about the guests ?
i ' m not sure . accurate , i guess .
hmm . interesting .
why would he do that ? you didn ' t have anything to do with the accident .
because i was driving behind the bus , <person> . because i saw it . i saw it happen . <continued_utterance> if that bastard does subpoena me , if he forces me to go over this again , then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing .
spirit ? oh ! you mean `` aq '' . `` aggressive qualities '' ?
whatever the latest jargon is .
<person> , <person> . i have to use the phone .
<person> on .
damn fool . i knew that you were going to say that !
who ' s the more foolish . the fool or the fool who follows him ?
i ' ve been going to <person> ' s place . and cleaning it .
do you know what i ' ve given up for you ? for this . for you . for you .
what scene ?
the one where you go to the slave market . you can cut right to the scene where <person> the baptist -
<person> .
come one , come on , it ' s fun . it ' s fun .
somebody make a note . i want li . , for the broad . what does she like ? lilacs . <person> . a truck of lilacs when the broad comes . and get something for <person> , get him , what does he like . ?
<person> . <person> . <person> ' s in this movie ?
<person> .
go , floyd .
i ' m not so sure . you oughtta sit him down , remind him how a chain-of-command works .
he ' s fine , <person> .
some unfinished business .
if you wan na do business in this town , there ' s other people around here got more weight than old <person> .
<person> , my brother isn ' t as bad as he ' s painted . he isn ' t perfect , but -
but he isn ' t going to like this , <person> . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i wouldn ' t give him a second thought if not for you .
did you not hear me say my husband fell in love with my gown ? has your fiance expressed any interest in what you ' ll be wearing ?
none at all .
you can ' t do that , i won ' t let you !
no , no , no , this is a job that ' s hard to
<person> ' t bother him with that . we got to get going .
it ' ll just take a second .
good night , <person> .
can i ask you one other thing ? what ' s with the turtlenecks ? it ' s the middle of summer .
i think so .
it ' s been a while , no ?
that ' s all right .
i was thinking maybe i could set a few out by the register ?
no .
why not ?
i received a telegram from <person> informing me that he had made me a privy councillor . i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse . after the dreadful events of november <number> , the violent attacks on the jews , i stopped using the title .
what about vice-president of the chamber of music , you used that title didn ' t you ? but then i suppose you had no choice there either , because i suppose dr . <person> just sent you a telegram saying , <person> mr . vice-president .
<person> , mr . <person> . i am very sorry we will not see each other as frequently .
yes . they turn and begin walking down the street .
no ! no , no ! <person> and help you , i will . find your friend , hmm ?
i ' m not looking for a friend . i ' m looking for a <person> .
the propecy is coming true , the dark side is growing .
and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future . only going through the dark side can we see .
i think <person> did it .
did what <person> ?
it ' s kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing . it ' s kinda cool . it ' s like you ' re in on some kind of secret . you tell a chick you ' ve been some place , it ' s like bragging that you know how to find it . the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there . you have to have someone come before . there is a direct line connecting you back to the original , unequivocally cool , club patrons . it ' s kinda like <person> .
sounds more like <person> .
as i said , in every way . physically and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you <number> . <number> .
. he used to say , `` if it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it . ``
<person> ! <continued_utterance> <person>o , scotch is a drink . scots are a people . <person> , that just always bugged me .
i ' m sorry , i didn ' t know it meant so much to you .
i don ' t care . we ' ve got ta stop her .
killing <person> might actually prevent the war .
why else do you think we were assigned to her , if not to find the killer ? protection is a job for local security . not jedi . it ' s overkill , <person>aster . investigation is implied in our mandate .
we will do as the council has instructed , and you will learn your place , young one .
ahhhh . i ' m getting there , yes .
<person> ? i think if you let me tell you the full everything of this we ' d be in a position to deal with it better . because eleven weeks ago when .
you ' ll find some other girl . but she won ' t have my style .
st . <person> , you brought me back to life .
i don ' t know . to grow , to go out .
anything ?
<person> , had an audience .
it ' s okay . . it was a great save . <person> ' s start the thrombolytic protocol . `` <number> units of heparin . mr . <person> , if this works and i have every reason to believe it will , it ' s going to reverse what ' s going on so there will be little or no damage to your heart . you with me ? okay , here we go .
you ' re scared of him . i can see it .
the hell i am . <continued_utterance> dad , don ' t hang up . we ' re going to talk . i need your help .
not fired darlin ' . just not needed .
what do you mean , not needed ? of course we need her . she ' s gon na take care of you and feed you and .
silence , you god ! i am <person> ! i am <person> ! i am <person> ! i am <person> , the jew of malta -- of yes , master <person> , and i am <person> . what is the play , and what is my part ?
a moment , sir !
just what did you hear ?
well there was the crack in the planet . that was noisy . <continued_utterance> there ' s an actual noise in my head . no kidding .
not if we let her in .
no .
against our own team ?
are you questioning my patriotism ?
this is like nursery school .
<person> ' t you see it ? it ' s a picture of the creature .
could be anything .

well , thank you , i ' ve heard a lot of nice things about you too , and .
the lost twenty . and <person> was the most recent and the most painful . no one likes to talk about it . his leaving was a great loss to the order .
what happened ?
<person> not to smoke them . and i packed you a sandwich , just in case your blood sugar got low . and some of that iced-tea you like , and a nonfat , low cholesterol cookie . and a peach .
what a doll . got something else ?
<person> didn ' t come .
oh . well . how are you going to get it home ?
no !
yes !
i don ' t even know you .
you know me . i ' m just like you . it ' s two in the morning and i don ' t know nobody . the two just stand there in silence a second . there ' s nothing more to say . she stands back and lets him in .
he ' s in sickbay . <person> says he can be repaired . but we have to wait until we .
<person> to our own time ?
you didn ' t kiss me -- i suppose ?
did you expect me to deny that , too ?
i feel as if you haven ' t heard anything i ' ve been saying to you .
i don ' t believe you .
ten thirty ?
we ' ll be there .
and mine is wearing thin , young man ! we supported you because you promised action . and yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with <person> while --
commander suran , the games are over . in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair .
he ' ll have to take a check . i couldn ' t find my wallet .
<person> , he knows that .
<person> want him for ?
he ' s not in trouble . it ' s personal .
i got ta go actually , so --
<person> , go .

it ' s you should take care , my dear . i ' m afraid there ' s one man you can ' t rawhide into jumping the way you want . you ' ve made a fool of yourself over him once . <person> watch out you don ' t do it again .
i did it for her . <continued_utterance> <person> kid has to believe in someone . even if it ' s you .

<person> was never like this . <person> would never have been like this .
oh boy . destroy humanity and the federation is crippled .
and the romulans invade .
on no , i ' d be much too frightened to tease a senator .
you ' re so bad !
honestly ? i ' d leave it off .
so then you think i could go to a poetry concert like this ?
you took the fuckin jam out of my donut <person> , you did .
you said get a good deal so .
what the hell happened ? !
i don ' t believe it . i don ' t believe it .
some tips . <person> ' t dart your eyes around . <person> ' t look in the mirror or you ' ll id yourself . ok ? you got a half hour of tape , so give me some lead-in to the main event . but don ' t wait too long , i don ' t want to be going out for popcorn . and don ' t act natural . <person> ' t act at all . just forget the thing is on . got it ?
no problem .
who ' d ever try driving cattle over table-top ? -- unless they were crazy .
i don ' t agree with you . in any case -- if you must have it -- i ' d no intention of engaging a man at foreman ' s wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman !
there was only two .
more than two . everything i need . <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> a necklace .
do you remember him ?
oh yes . i remember everyone who was on the lakul . every face . even the ones who didn ' t make it .
right .
then it never happened . <person> goes to answer the door . <continued_utterance> hi .
that ' s quite a secret .
i spent a week reading <person> and watching re-runs of the twilight zone . <person> . i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
i thought you met someone else .
it doesn ' t matter . i think about you every day .
that sounds right . i ' m going .
you gon na get yourself killed for this ? this toxic-waste bitch !
i don ' t want a science lecture . you were on that observatory looking for trilithium . why ?
i was ordered to by the captain .
mrs . <person> , the v-chip hasn ' t been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .

<person> ?
you ' re in deep enough , <person> .
i ' ve called for all i ' ve got . <person> house .

it ' s called probing . it ' s a military procedure . you send a reconnaissance group , very small , to check out things . not to engage , but to evaluate the situation . evaluate the level of danger . <person> sure things are all clear .
`` hasta la vista , baby '' ?
yeah , or `` later , dickwad . `` or if someone gets upset you say `` chill out . `` like that . or you can do combinations .

none .
<person> music died in <number> , that ' s what i think . before that it was fantastic . i can tell you that . <person> was crashing , hanging out at the fillmore . me and my girlfriend <person> used to go up the fire escape , you know ? it was unbelievable . <person> stars everywhere . that airplane -- that ' s my group , man . all libras . but now everybody ' s split or got sick or busted . i think i ' ll move to one of those communes in vermont , you know ? that ' s where all the smart ones went . i stayed here .

oh my god . are you sure . ? who would do such a thing ?
ock .

well he ' s got her in a tizzy , i ' ll tell you that !
publish your work ? ! you hear that may . ?
yeah , in fact i have to leave a little early tonight , to meet <person> . he offered me to be his assistant .
it was just words .
but good words . that ' s where ideas begin . maybe you should listen to them .
i do what i got ta do to survive .
you have no right to call yourself a bowler . <person> slaps theo in the face .

c ' mon , you can do better than that .
it ' s a program . it shifts identities . it also performs small amounts of time travel . or `` time engineering . `` i don ' t know the jargon . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been put on this train to look for someone . a criminal . and i need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train . <person> right here ' s only place i can figure out what ' s really happening . but i have very little time . and each time i come back , you won ' t remember me and i ' ll have to go through this all over again .
you are , i think , deliciously mad .
everything has it ' s drawbacks .

i have spoken with your father .
so my lord ? i speak with him every day . <continued_utterance> good sir ? <continued_utterance> i heard you are a poet . <continued_utterance> but a poet of no words ?
oh , but <person> , i ' m sure this thing must be some practical joke . you know , <person> sometimes goes too far . of course i shouldn ' t be saying this to an outsider , but sometimes he ' s terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades .
but don ' t you understand , mrs . <person> -- your son is responsible for a woman ' s death .
<person> .
<person> , don ' t say anything .
he has gone to the line camp at <person> .

i ' d like to hear it . can you sing something ?
i do not want to .
where are we going ?
that ' s for us to know and <person> to find out . we have only three days . <person> ' s not waste time .

we ' re out of money .
you built an old <person> in new hampshire .
already ? you poor thing . it won ' t last .
why not ?
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector . any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction . <person> is starting to get an idea . he ' s onto something here . he moves to a large table in the center of the room .
a minor course correction . where is the ribbon now ?
<person> ' t go . spend the night with me .
oh . one night won ' t kill you . and tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life . <continued_utterance> is everything okay ?
<person> is when i need you the most . only one more season . this year we ' ll make enough on the harvest so i ' ll be able to hire some more hands . and then you can go to the academy next year . <continued_utterance> you must understand i need you here , <person> .
but it ' s a whole ' nother year .
hey , it ' s none of my business why you ' re chasing a retard . you want my opinion , it ' s the girl . she had to hold the guy ' s hand all the way to the car like he was a kid .
you saw that ?
i don ' t believe it .
<person> to me --
oh , yeah . <person> .
and ?
why ?
i got ta thing . just drop me off here .
<person> . security ' s been our biggest worry . now that you ' re here we can shut this thing down tight .
from what ? what ' s with all the security ?
no , baby . you ' re money .
she didn ' t like me , anyway .
our habitat , i mean . this place can ' t handle another attack .
another attack ? <continued_utterance> why are you looking at me like that ?
what is your name ? my name is <person> .
<person> , come off it , pal .
a list ? why ?
we ' re getting girls their booze so they ' ll get with us . i put a lot of thought into that list . it ' s the perfect party bar , so don ' t mess it up and get <person> again .
you from out of town . ?
yeah , you know , actually , i was just looking for my daughter .
it just isn ' t fair . oh , <person> is right . i ' m never gon na get out of here !
is there anything i might do to help ?
the death of my father .
tell me . <person> ' t lie , or i ' ll know .
<person> . all this time right in front of us . how could i have been so blind ?
<person> , we won ' t even remember this tomorrow .
well , i finished my circle . i don ' t pick up any life readings .
there isn ' t enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser . the sensors are placed , i ' m going back .
<person> ? oh yes , he is the one , lovely waistcoat , shame about the poetry .
that dog ! angle on the queen .
what ?
get on . i ' ll take you to him .
you bringing your new friend ?

<person> ' t you get that stuff off him ?
no , they ' ve done everything they can until the crane comes .
i ' m making something happen !
you gone too far !
and you and mr . <person> knew the truth all the time ?
yes .
i know that one was me .
<person> not to keep score . <continued_utterance> soft lips .
as any mule in christendom . but if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .
i like her .
oh , fine . . i ' m fine , i ' m .
one more fine and i won ' t believe you .
get the fuck out of my house .
<person> , come on . what the heck ? <person> ' t be a dick .
i don ' t tell that . i save that for blackmail .
then perhaps i ' d better hang up .
fine , fine .
beautiful view , isn ' t it ?
<person> , i caught your act the other night and -
did you now ? on which bounce ?
oh .
should i keep reading ?
what ?
well , you just seem , like .
maybe de<person> is shooting .
i know that trick ! he wants to belittle me . he ' s trying to get my price down . i ' ve waited twenty years for this call . now mr . de<person> can wait till i ' m good and ready .
why ?
what he does with them - takes privacy . time , tools . he ' s in his <number> ' s or <number> ' s - he ' s got real physical strength , but combined with an older man ' s self-control . he ' s cautious , precise , never impulsive . this won ' t end in suicide , like they often do .
<person> , please , <person> . <person> . be cool .
who the fuck is <person> ?
you ' ll take a cut of what i make , won ' t ya ?
i ' m out , <person> .
well . not every saturday .
just so you know -- we always had front row at the mammal show . <person> does the funniest dolphin impression . actually , it ' s more -- <person> as a dolphin --
<person> , get this through your head . i ' m not just your agent . it ' s not the ten per cent . i ' m your friend .
how ' s that about your being my friend ?
i ' d love to . babe -- but i ' ve got to go . it was great . <person> usual .
it was twenty minutes . <person> usual .
huh .
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it ' s not even worthy of a response . i guess i ' ll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .
<person> tough on the butt .
everything has it ' s drawbacks .
hope she was worth it .
uh huh .
<person> , listen to what you ' re saying . this thing ' s changed itself into a man . disappearing may not be that big a deal .
so far you ' ve let it cross the heart of america . for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security . i don ' t see the humor in that .
i wouldn ' t think so .
that ' s what i thought . so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late , you know .
stop this , please , stop this now !
no , i ' m not going to stop it . <person> himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter .
yes . and in doing so , you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming .
and i thought my mother was the master of guilt . <person> .
-- get back to me , yeah , i know . here ' s what i ' m gon na do . i ' m gon na have a couple my `` teammates '' here escort you back to wherever you came from . and then i ' m gon na go back to the office and wait for that official cooperation request . okay by you ?
swell .
i don ' t like people looking at me like that .
like what ?
what other motive could i have ?
i don ' t know -- it ' s just that <person> was a peculiar man -- had a funny way of doing things . <continued_utterance> well , i ' m sorry , mr . <person> , that you ' ve been brought all this way on a fool ' s errand , but -- i ' m afraid the deal ' s off .
they revoke our flight status .
oh , i see . teamwork .
the landlady - as far as i could tell , the landlady said he was here right now .
he ' s gone to dinner ! search the place . i can ' t think why you would imagine <person> would hide from you .
i don ' t care for b . s . i don ' t care to hear it . i don ' t care to speak it .
<person> .
i wouldn ' t say `` friends . `` i ' m a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning . that ' s a wonderful pet to have .
got you out of the laundry , didn ' t it ?
no ? just wait . <continued_utterance> word gets around . the sisters have taken a real shine to you , yes they have . especially <person> .
tell me something . would it help if i explained to them i ' m not homosexual ?
i don ' t really sell raw materials .
i just moved here , you know , and i don ' t have a space to work . do you think i could do some work for you , help you clean up or whatever you need , in exchange for using your shop ? you don ' t have to pay me .
what ?
<person> comes to visit me sometimes .
just kickin ' back , i guess . i don ' t know . <person> and i were supposed to go golfing .
huh .
no funnier than you sloggin ' through it , just to deliver a letter from a woman .
when are we gon na get around to readin ' it ?
you made me hurt him !
look what i got for you . <continued_utterance> <person> birthday <person> !
. it ' s my problem , too . <continued_utterance> i got used to . thinking of them .
really . by what right ? six months of part-time screw-ups ?
<person> ?
<person> .
a virgin brain ! well we ' re going to start you off right . so what do you know about this ? save us some time .
just what i ' ve read . that the technology was developed for the feds , to replace the body wire . and now it ' s gone black market . so , uh , do i get the deck from you ?
what ' s the line on visitation ?
<number> to <number> . that ain ' t bad .
just point her at capri and avoid the rocks .
what are you doing ?
what ' re you going to do ? <continued_utterance> you can ' t just . kill him .
i ' m not . just a little poach job .
so far you ' ve let it cross the heart of america . for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security . i don ' t see the humor in that .
maybe . look , this is just something to think about . from what i got at the shopping center , it was more scared than anything else . i don ' t feel it ' s as big a threat as you think it is .
this is absolutely yummy .
we could go into hadditon , get a meal .
<person> is your dad .
what do you think my dad ' s gon na do for you ?
i am having fun . <continued_utterance> no thanks .
<person> breath .
manifested ?
created . <person> to life . i don ' t know . but at the end , <person> said , `` stop calling me <person> '' . and -- norman stops , staring at the pad . <continued_utterance> he translated it wrong .
we don ' t need any misfits around here , son .
you kiddin ? who else would hack through south bronx or <person> at night ?
<person> , <person> , please .

you have the key . tell me some good things about <person> . <person> ' t get up . just tell me some nice things .
good things about <person> ? could take some time ! . <person> is talented . <person> is tender . <person> is beautiful .
why did she do it ?
you . she said i didn ' t love her .
<person> rule is not democracy , <person> . it gives the people what they want , not what they need . and , truthfully , i was relieved when my two terms were up . so were my parents . they worried about me during the blockade and couldn ' t wait for it all to be over . actually , i was hoping to have a family by now . my sisters have the most amazing , wonderful kids . but when the <person> asked me to serve as senator , i couldn ' t refuse her .
i agree ! i think the republic needs you . i ' m glad you chose to serve . i feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways .
no officer . not at all .
is that more beer you got over there ?
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
trials aren ' t only about truth , mr . <person> . even though they should be . they ' re about what people <continued_utterance> we were afraid . <person> seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake .
sure . of course .
thanks . ' night .
-- a slice of pizza --
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you ' re halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it ' s just a drink , if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don ' t you can go home if you see what i mean . i wonder if it still works this way .
me too .
i would love to see you again sometime .
that ' s . <continued_utterance> it ' s why i ' m here . i ' m afraid i have some . very bad news to tell you , the . worst . kind of news . <continued_utterance> <person> died last night . in a fishing accident . in white sand bay .

you ' ve been here all bloody night , srinivas . what have you been doing ?
you heard the sky marshall . move it all down -
<person> , prepare to receice outgoing fire . ! i ' ll take the first group .
am i ? <continued_utterance> all right , i am , i know it ! all my life , i ' ve just been . upbeat . optimistic . <person> . i can ' t help it . even when i was little , i remember my mother used to say , `` that child is pure sunshine . she ' ll either be a nun -- or a stewardess . ``
so use it . when we sing hymns , they ' re usually about rejoicing , right ? celebration . most music is . so don ' t hold back . let all that joy go right into your voice . make me happy . let me hear it . <person> out . <person> down .
<person> got us another gig .
i ' m sleeping .

starling - you ' ve earned back your place in the academy . we never would ' ve found him without you , and nobody ' s ever going to forget that . least of all me .
seattle boys think he ' s guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
they ' re not his neighbor , like you are . he is a husband , a father , he risked his <continued_utterance> well , folks are pretty cold . and folks who believe in nothing else . they ' re cold , too . <continued_utterance> i ' ve tried to understand your unhappiness , all these years . having gone to war , losing your arm . <continued_utterance> but other boys came back . and pushed on . they found girls , and married , had babies .
the secret of it . that only magicians . can ever understand . <continued_utterance> see , when we die . our body goes away . our body . but
but you can still see him .
hi boss .
you ' re not allergic are you ?
lie . that ' s one . keep going .
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed . and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like .
i ' ll work anywhere , anytime . i know i can ' t be choosy .
how ' s your driving record ?
me ? um . you know , i haven ' t really decided yet . i might check out long and <person> .
maybe you ' ll just be independent .
you want something done , j . j . , but i doubt if you yourself know what ' s involved .
i ' m a schoolboy - teach me , teach me .
drop that attitude . here ' s some- thing really worth while .

dr . <person> , <person> here in washington . can you give us an idea of why they ' re here ?
they ' re so advanced . i . eh . can ' t imagine what they would want from us . i know they could be dangerous . but they could also be the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind .
a day .
<person> ?
you did , didn ' t you ?
<person> ' t do this .
it ' s a shame it doesn ' t fit . perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it .
yeah but i didn ' t know you then .
stop joking . who are you ? are you an operative ?
i had no idea you were so thoroughly weird . i ' m not entirely sure i like it .
that ' s right , yeah ! i got some old debts i ' ve got to pay off with this stuff . even if i didn ' t , you don ' t think i ' d be fool enough to stick around here , do you ? why don ' t you come with us ? you ' re pretty good in a fight . i could use you .
come on ! why don ' t you take a look around ? you know what ' s about to happen , what they ' re up against . they could use a good pilot like you . you ' re turning your back on them .
i ' m fun .
oh , sweetie . no , you ' re not .
good money -- sixty a month
there ain ' t enough money in this town to make it worth your while to work for that gal . <continued_utterance> when she gits goin ' she can be meaner ' n a skillet full o ' snakes . she ain ' t goin ' to forget the way you made a fool of her today -- in front of the whole town .
they ' re right here .
oh . <continued_utterance> what are you thinking , <person> ?
are we expected to carry our bags at this time of night ?

<person> , for about a month now . <person> , just stay away from <person> , okay ? and stay away from me . stop trying to rescue me . those days are over . i ' m a big girl now . stop trying to save me , okay , because i don ' t need saving . just . give up on me .
<person> ' t do it .
because if <person> is powerful and also emotional .
damn it , edmunds ?
who the hell are you ?
spider-man .
he ' s given me some stuff too . toys , and some books .
<person> . <continued_utterance> he ' s a very kind man . and he knew that you ' d need a computer for doing schoolwork .
they ' ve come for my car .
please . now i ' ve forgotten how many spades are out .
and when did you last see <person> ?
a few days ago .
yes , sir .
he come back ?
<person> how can you hate `` the colonel ? ''
because the colonel puts an addictive chemical in it that makes you crave it fortnightly .
<person> , you like everybody .
i don ' t like you .
and this woman is a writer ! that ' s what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers .
i know that . you think i don ' t know that ? `` i know that ' s a dumb way to begin , but it ' s the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i ' m just losing my mind . ``
right . <continued_utterance> a couple of bowls of chili . and another round of these .
i have to do this . so i can become a nun .
you ' re ridiculing me because i care about this .
no . i ' m not . i mean this . let ' s get away from those two in case they ' re as miserable as they look .
we need experience .
and you , with the devil ' s brew passing through your lips . a mind is a terrible thing to waste .
<person> , <person> . <person> to hear that .
i ain ' t . he was an asshole . run off years ago , family ain ' t heard of him since . figured him for dead anyway . so this lawyer prick says , your brother died a rich man . oil wells and shit , close to a million bucks . <person> , it ' s frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get .
you seem to have an answer for everything .
something wrong with that ?
someone tried to rob me of some paper . i suspect they were looking for that one .
what is it ?
so ?
i ' m a rockhound . at least i was , in my old life . i ' d like to be again , on a limited scale .
he took stuff from you ?
besides the address book ? he took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer . and my skis . and my tv .
is big deal . <person> . you good boy , smart , everybody like you , but .
but .
you sure you wan na start off that big ? bet like that could put a real dent in us .
i feel lucky tonight .
if you only knew the power of the dark side . obi-wan never told you what happened to your father .
he told me enough ! it was you who killed him .
oh , so you wait ' til we get out to the hamptons to let me know you ' re a wise ass . <person> on . . . it just so happens , my dear , that women of a certain age , don ' t date me . you ever think of it that way ? no , it ' s always me . you dames are all alike . hey .
<person> .
i told her i loved her .
by way of saying you were unhappy .
why ?
time for a change . keep your margins straight .
really ? what ' s that ?
his balls .
he ' s focused on <person> . who fits the profile of <person> ' s victims . he went on <person> ' s computer and e- mailed copies of <person> ' s files to an e-mail account in denmark . constant threat of discovery , <person> will become more disorganized .
<person> . my office will arrange a press conference . i will tell a room full of correspondents we have a suspect who is dead and murder victims who are alive . and i ' ll sound like a madman .
you from back east of something ?
no , he ' s from the future .
maybe you ' ve got a knack for this . i guess we ' re about to find out .
like i have a `` knack '' for dr . <person> ?
three grand on the black .
you sure you wan na start off that big ? bet like that could put a real dent in us .
yes ?
inspector roverini . can we come in ?
i don ' t know where he is .
nobody knows where he is .
what am i - arm candy ?
more like arm fungus with that face on . <person> , meet <person> . <person> , meet <person> , my fiance .
played a mean harmonica as a younger man . lost my taste for it . <person> ' t make much sense on the inside .
here ' s where it makes most sense . we need it so we don ' t forget .
no .
i ' m your program ?
yes .
when ?
i didn ' t even like her , to be honest .
she was hot .
i , wait , i no . i . i want to talk to my lll .
izzat her ? it ' s her , isn ' t it . she was here . is that her . ?
i am delighted ; any chance to go aboard <person> , however briefly , is always an excuse for nostalgia .
i cut your new orders personally . by the end of the month , you ' ll have your first command : uss excelsior .
what ' s that ?
it might be a calculation of the amount of power he needs to create the hole between the force and the anti-force .
no . it ' s the silver star .
send it on to his father . it ' ll ease the pain of his son ' s death .
as much as we care for him , <person> . we have to remember that <person> isn ' t capable of disappointment .
i don ' t believe that , sir . we ' ve shared many disappointing journeys .
<person> told me .
how does he . ? <continued_utterance> that ' s just great . we burnt down a client ' s house . how do you get around that ?
promise me you ' ll give it a try . please ?
i will . i promise . see you later
i don ' t know .
how can the sphere do that ?
the nexus .
<person> has no meaning there . the predator has no teeth .
yes ! hi . what can i do for you ?
we ' ve got a house we need to turn around and our regular guys are busy in santa fe today . thought i ' d give you all a call . rose knocks over a bottle of nail polish remover as she grabs a pen and writes down the info .
then why are you putting on mascara ?
i ' m a little tired and it ' s just a pick-me-up .
<person> is a liar !
who said <person> ?
anything . that had a blond hair .
<person> introduction of <person> <number> . one single blond hair . which <person> dug out of that fracture . below the mast . of <person> heine ' s boat . <continued_utterance> we will call <person> , who will confirm this . and <person> whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceased ' s skull fracture . <continued_utterance> but for now . your witness .
can we not do this now ? he ' s actually incredibly smart and fascinating and if you had talked to him about something other than his marital status you would ' ve found out how smart he is . he owns like <number> different companies .
what does that mean he owns ten different companies ? he can ' t commit , that ' s what that means . not that , <person> forbid , i want him to commit .
what time .
nine .
that ' s another thing . you seem obsessed with this woman ' s dying .
well , it turned out that cremation is almost as expensive as the non- torch method -- so if i don ' t find a cheaper solution -- i ' ll probably end up .
who ' s norma ?
who ' s who ?
you did break in .
<person> to . <person> ' t quite make the connection with that sucker , though . if i had a direct terminal .
sedition and indecency !
what ? !
. they ' re going to send me to a party .
no , <person> , you ' re going home . you ' re just taking the long way home .
he offered to help , starling , not to snitch . that wouldn ' t give him enough chance to show off . remember , <person> looks mainly for fun . never forget fun .
but if he knew we have so little time -
more people watch it .
<person> , forget it if you ' re not going to be serious,
<person> could be down there !
he ' s been there and hasn ' t found what he wants . can you spare someone ? there may be people hurt .
<person> . on break ?
yeah . two blue crushes please .
i need a reason to say no . until leslie agrees to marry me , i ' ve got to grab some of the gusto .
you ' ve seen too many beer commercials .

. and even then .
everything is somebody else ' s-
not your children . not your life .
no-gah-buh- no ! rule number two - no names ! no goddamn names , you retard !
oh for chrissakes . `` white trash <person> . `` i didn ' t realize the rules went into effect before we entered <person> .
i ' m hip .

beth and <person> ?
they ' re in the sub , sir . waiting .
no , it ' s <person> ' s . <person> , eh ?
golly . who ' s paying for this ?
<person> up .
what ' s so special about <person> ?
we just have a railroad flat in a tenement --
it ' s over a roller disco . the last of the roller discos but it ' s quiet by five am and a great narrow space -
you made your point . i was wrong to make a joke about a person ' s life .
i really want to know about his wife .
not unless you can raise the dead .
here . you may change your mind .
she sewed for everybody . stores , ladies , whatever . i don ' t know about men .
who was her best friend , mr . <person> ? who ' d she hang out with ?
you could have called me --
no way . no way i was going to be the first woman you went out with after . there is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after .
<person> ? <continued_utterance> is that you down there ?
<person> ! <person> , <person> . me and the squad .
of course not , <person> . it ' s just that i don ' t want to be left alone . not now , while i ' m under this terrible strain . my nerves are being torn apart . all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind .
i haven ' t done anything , norma .
dr . <person> , there ' s no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence . transsexuals are very passive .
clever girl . you ' re so close to the way you ' re going to catch him - do you realize that ?
i said excuse me .
<person> down . <continued_utterance> what ? i don ' t know you . what can i do for you ? you look like a jedi . whatever it is . i didn ' t do it .
could you tell me when ' s the next train ?
n ' about ten minutes . what was your movie about ? <continued_utterance> no , of course , you don ' t want to talk about it .
dubious but special honor , <person> - crewing <person> ' s boat . <person> , bar ' s open .
yes please !
i was wondering why you haven ' t been sleeping over . jules , i don ' t think you should start bopping your boss .
<person> late , <person> . you should see him -- sort of a cross between <person> and <person> .
<person> ' t grieve , admiral -- it ' s logical : the good of the many outweighs --
. the good of the few .
it ' s very common to become emotional after having an episode like you ' ve had .
so it ' s not crazy for a man to do something entirely out of character after having a heart attack ?
where you going ?
going home .
<person> applesauce .
<person> .
trust your first instincts , <person> . you never do . it ' s your big mistake . that and the haircut .

for i love . lo-ove you soooo .
how could i not ?
captain , don ' t assume he ' s anything like you are . you should resist the urge to think you know him .
marrying the senator ' s daughter has nothing to do with it . can ' t a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker ?
take it easy , boy . i ' m your friend , remember ? i ' d do anything for you .
that the stage for <person> ?
leaving any minute . <continued_utterance> <person> -- seventeen-fifty -- name ?
<person> good , mrs . <person> .

i ' ve got a date .
he ' s got a date . he ' s got a date , is this guy fantastic . ? already he learned how to write a movie , and he found a girl to get his toes curled , what a guy , what a . what a literary find !
i don ' t think so . one jedi has to be worth a hundred geonosians .
it wasn ' t the geonosians i was thinking about . how well do you think one jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids ? count dooku signals . thousands of droids start to pour into all parts of the arena .
he didn ' t tell me you was a fuck- up , either . you played the big con since then .
no , i lammed it around for a while while things cooled off . philly , denver , baltimore , nuthin ' towns . <continued_utterance> but don ' t kid yourself , friend , i still know how . <continued_utterance> you gon na stay for breakfast , or do you already know how to eat ?
<person> ? she ' s okay . <continued_utterance> dad , i was talking to <person> about reincarnation , and she thinks that probably you knew <person> in another life .

<person> is so fond of <person> .
i ' ve moved in with <person> .
he ' s gon na set up <person> for us .
he ' ll never do it .
a recoil , with no compensating mechanism .
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the . original , the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness .
c ' mon , you know that won ' t .
we ' ve got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards . we ' ve got people pointing fingers , making side deals , and dickering over percentages . yesterday , i heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad . the rescue squad . because they didn ' t act fast enough . <continued_utterance> if you two dropped the case , then the others would come to their senses <continued_utterance> and follow . you ' re good sensible parents , you and <person> . people respect you . <continued_utterance> <person> .
it ' s already five o ' clock .

ar , sala ! <person> , <person> ! pit-stop ka speed , <person> ka ishtyle <continued_utterance> go , go !
woah . what happened here ?
folks who run this place love surprise inspections . they turn a blind eye to some things , but not a gadget like that . they ' ll find it , and you ' ll lose it . mention my name , we ' ll never do business again . not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum .
i understand . thank you , mr . ?
there was an accident . drunk driving . they weren ' t sure .
he wasn ' t drinking . <person> fell asleep at the wheel .
i can ' t say i ' m very happy about doing this -- i only hope it works out for the best .
it ' s the better choice of two evils -- now let ' s see -- i , <person> -- it is <person> , isn ' t it ?

then what is it ? <person> ' t you already know who the bomber is ? <person> ' t you have all the answers ?
it ' s been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns . and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds .
not another lecture , <person> . not on the economics of politics . it ' s too early in the morning . and besides , you ' re generalising . the chancellor doesn ' t appear to be corrupt .

they do something to me . it ' s hard to think straight .
mr . <person> , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
so what do we do ?
eight point . no , uh , seven .
if you can ' t do those numbers , you haven ' t got a chance .
<person> ' s sick , guys .
you have the worst flu since .

well , why didn ' t you just say so in the first place ?
i want to hear your version .

the armies of commerce ! why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them ?
i ' m afraid that , despite the chancellor ' s best efforts , there are still many bureaucrats , judges , and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds .
no don ' t touch me , don ' t you dare .
i ' m sorry .
you don ' t get two chances with <person> .
at least i ' ll die smiling .
i became sure of what an incredibly lucky woman you are and i must make myself not envy you which is hard . no , it ' s not hard . it ' s impossible .
<person> here - believe me .

how did you get over it ? i mean how long ' til it stopped hurting ?
sometimes is still hurts . you know how it is , man . i mean , each day you think about it less and less . and then one day you wake up and you don ' t think of it at all , and you almost miss that feeling . it ' s kinda weird . you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long . and the , boom , something reminds you of her , and you just smile that bittersweet smile .
it ' s over , <person> .
<person> , no .

this is totally different . i ' m talking about avoiding what you ' re talking about . that ' s the distinction . i have not made the commitment yet . i am not married . i have not said the words . in a few days , i might get married , and if i do , then i won ' t be doing stuff like this anymore . <person> , what ' s the whole point of getting married ?
no . i was in the bathroom and .
oh , you did it in the bathroom ? <person> , this is craziness , why don ' t you use your bed ? you ' re up all night . you ' re in the radioactive labs . you never take time to eat or sleep . am i right ?

i can ' t afford a suit .
i didn ' t say buy a suit . i said find a suit . so when you make it big , you ' ll already know what looks good .
we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems , agree what ' s in the best interests of all the people , and then do it .
that is exactly what we do . the trouble is that people don ' t wlways agree . in fact , they hardly ever do .
but .
we didn ' t know if any bleed- throughs could occur . the implications would be staggering . that ' s why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events .
well , it ' s certainly what you ' d call interesting .
you hate it .
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings .
<person> carefully , <person> . maybe not in your own name , but as privy councillor or vice-president .

all your soldiers speak <person> ?
no , just one .
you ' ve left school , put yourself into debt , lied to <person> who got you this job in the first place -- and all for a woman who doesn ' t seem to be interested in you .
when she sees me in this setting and realizes my potential , which she has always secretly known about me , the veil will be stripped from her eyes and she will give herself to me tonight .
i can ' t stay here .
<person> , please . <person> , i ' m serious . i won ' t make it .
calculated risk . only we happen to know , j . j . , that you like me . i ' m your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent . <person> permits himself a faint smile . <person> is approaching with script in hand .
i wouldn ' t like to take a bite of you ; you ' re a cookie full of arsenic .
information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
<person> again ! and get out of here .
isn ' t that what you want us to believe ? that we ' re completely defenseless ? that you know what ' s best ?
<person> to me , mrs <person> . <person> very carefully . i do know what ' s best . as we ' re sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves . and this makes me very , very mad . it ' s why i came all the way up here . if everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school . i promise you that i will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job . <continued_utterance> who is responsible for this tragedy . then , in your name and the walkers ' name and the name of whoever decides to join us , i shall sue . i shall sue for negligence until they bleed .

you can ' t just make a person up .
<person> , <person> ' s saying goodbye .
i ' ll come down .
<person> , doesn ' t this `` <person> '' strike you as - i don ' t know - kind of vague ?
do you need a police escort , starling ? or do you think you can find the airport by yourself ?
why ?
i kinda thought i might make a good one . i ' m very observant .
do you understand me ?
no , sir .
kind of weird , don ' t you think ? teaching a gorilla to talk . probably , gorillas aren ' t supposed to talk .
that ' s what ' s so cool about it .
i suppose we are .
i ask a question ? why ' d you do it ?
this is our wedding and you ' re not taking it seriously .
no , i ' m not -- it ' s a circus ! two hundred people -- page six -- this is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look ?

some ideals are worth dying for , aren ' t they , <person> ?

i ' m not the love of your life .
who says ?
she hit it , mr . <person> !
four or five years when a girl like that ' s bowling on the pro tour for team <person> , she ' ll pay a handsome profit on my investment .
what good ' s a reward if you ain ' t around to use it ? besides , attacking that battle station ain ' t my idea of courage . it ' s more like suicide .
all right . well , take care of yourself , <person> . i guess that ' s what you ' re best at , isn ' t it ?
shut up , sir ! we need pick up now !
what is your position ?
yes , yes you may notice that he can not even bring himself to utter his name , he . he refers to him as k . <continued_utterance> and ask him about his private life .
his private life ?

no . it was someone else . they don ' t know who . that ' s why i ' m here . to find out .
i ' m sorry . i didn ' t know .
growing up i quit speaking after that . i didn ' t say a word for three years . when you ' re not in the conversation , you get forgotten real quick . so i ' d watch people . study them . the mouth can say anything , but the body doesn ' t lie . the tilt of the head , the way the hands move . <person> draws closer . <person> watching her mouth .

you weren ' t hired to miss him .
there wasn ' t any way he coulda known we was in there . we made a clean pick on the lock and didn ' t leave no footprints in the hall .
<person> for you . you ' ve got yourself the best guy in town .

i ' m very , very good at it .
because this part requires a lot of it . you ' d play a cleaning lady .
no , that ' s your fault . it ' s her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . which means , the most important job .

no , i don ' t want the ' fuckin ' `` tie -- i ' m sorry -- i ' m glad she bought you a tie . you needed one . you look good in that tie . next time you two go shopping , maybe you could tell her we need a new maytag stackable , double-decker washer and dryer set . mike smiles , she gives him a kiss , and a flick on the nose . <continued_utterance> you want to see the bedroom .

we are passing through the bassen rift . the projections will return when we have cleared it .
i ' ve had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights . <person> ' t tell what they look like , cause they ' re staying in the shadows -- covert like . no one ' s got hurt mind you . and that ' s the give away .

only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both .
<person> , ask your own manager - he ' s standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife . so how do you get him doing j . j . a favor ?
oh ?
folks who run this place love surprise inspections . they turn a blind eye to some things , but not a gadget like that . they ' ll find it , and you ' ll lose it . mention my name , we ' ll never do business again . not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum .

you don ' t know shit . <person> suffering <person> and her poor suffering people . it ' s called `` going native '' -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it . she had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it . and now they ' re getting exactly what they want , which is the sheik will be back in the mix . but ten times as strong , because now he ' s the big man who stood up to the americans . i did what was necessary . i make no apologies . if you think you ' re going to be able to use that file against me , you know even less about politics than i imagined .

she ' s my destiny .
<person> ? you living in a perfume commercial ? she ' s a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride .
i said ' excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .
you were . overjoyed yourself , to hear the news ?
the time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds

<person> .
trying not to be . trying to jump ship .
i am not backing out .
you can bet your bollocks to a barn dance you ' re not backing out .
i can ' t tell .
why not ?
i saw it -- !
there ' s an air-lock .
it was either that , or a sardine . <continued_utterance> you get what you pay for .
that ' s true . you grow up here ?
then . when did she get better ?
she didn ' t .
she doesn ' t want us to go to baltimore . she wants to meet us in new york city on <person> ' s day . on top of the empire state building .
<person> . we ' ll be there .
<person> ?
we have destroyed your mosque . now , the followers of <person> will drive you dogs out of our city . <continued_utterance> <person> has returned to his temple ! <person> has returned !

that man -- who is he ?
<person> ! for the <person> it is time to eat as well . <person> , eat . hot . <person> food , hm ? <person> , hmm ?

i ' m not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends .
now i think i have upset you . my english perhaps is coarse .
he ' s coming on to me . he ' s feeling my ass during rehearsal .
he ' s your husband .
well you can ' t eat shell fish , dad , i t ' s against your persuasion .
what persuasion myself or the prawns belongs to is not the issue , the issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed to sneak in to ' my sandwich . <continued_utterance> sneaky bastards .
wait a minute , kid . i do know a little about surfing . i also know a lot about the wave here . what exactly are you looking for from me ?
i need a mentor ; you know like in <person> .

if you think i ' m going to live through another year of finding poorly written , unmailed love scratchings around this apartment .
i found her again . it ' s fate . it ' s true love . i have her hospital schedule !
we don ' t recognise the republic here , senator . but if <person> were to join our alliance , i could easily hear your plea for clemency .
and if i don ' t join your rebellion , i assume this jedi with me will also die ?
yeah well i didn ' t expect them to lock us up in here did i ?

<person> . ripe mangos hanging on a branch .
oh . <person> . why the borders ? almost every painting has one . was he in prison or something ?
no , it ' s the other piece . <person> .
<person> to fly . forrester , the magnificent animal , is waiting . did the hospital call ? is my stepmonster dead yet ?
i forgot your name .
dr . <person> .
<person> , i know . but i can ' t be responsible no more for making sure nothing happens . that ' s another terrible job i quit .
what are you talking about ? i take responsibility for anything within a block . you have nothing to worry about . that ' s my job .
i wan na be her , in that dress with him licking my teapot lids .
yeah . me too .
i get him to do it ?
he killed <person> , didn ' t he ? tell me , <person> !
i don ' t think i really want to see hell <person> . what ' s wrong with a normal gun ?
the are psychological advantages to a gun that looks like it can perforate the moon .
<person> .
what do you mean ?
<person> usually just sends those to the national media . the local press doesn ' t know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway .
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program . push the issues .
<person> nobody ' s gon na take this shit from a couple dominican rookies when you go to the u . s . for spring training this season . they glance up , eyes wide . did he just say .
you ' ve been invited to spring training . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
that moment will come . and your heart is going to whisper , ' here it is ' winds his fingers . around her hand . <continued_utterance> and you ' ll come through .

<person> !
<person> of education .
even if you don ' t recognize ' <person> in satchel ' as the most compelling piece ever to appear in . card even if . <continued_utterance> a triple increase in ad revenue . does get . the man ' s attention .
<person> ' t even double if yer figger it right . <person> is . a real reporter woulda <continued_utterance> named the obvious suspect .
no -- but mr . <person> has a letter that would prove it . my aunt wrote it before we came out here .
s ' pose we could get it ?
then i will kill you , cut off your ugly face , put it over mine , and buy it my fucking self .
you don ' t have the technology or the steady hands to pull off a procedure like that !
tell him i have a fiance , <person> has a fiance and freddie <person> probably had a string of them .
il signor <person> ha una fidanzata , il signor <person> ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie <person> ha molte fidanzate .
a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
clearly , you have learned nothing . and you present an ongoing threat , both to this convent and to yourself .
so you ' re hoping <person> can get you re- instated ?
well , that was plan a .
<person> was a gambler , eh ?
oh , yeah -- reckon a pretty poor one , tho ' -- still you ' d say him and <person> was friends .
you ' re picking up my lingo , hon . <continued_utterance> <person> , i like this new attitude of yours . you ' re growing up and i like it ! i don ' t like it when you ' re limp and dependent , when you ' re odd and wayward . this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world . <person> , don ' t forget , dear , you won ' t always have me with you , will you . ?
no , i won ' t .
where ?
sections twenty through twenty- eight on decks thirteen . fourteen . . and fifteen .
i was there in <number> . i lived on a farm .
with the higgins !
sido-dyas . isn't he the jedi who hired you for this job ?
never heard of him . i was recuited by a man called <person> on one of the moons of bogden .
<person> said .
i don ' t want to get you wet .
but don ' t you understand , mrs . <person> -- your son is responsible for a woman ' s death .
did <person> tell you this ?
i ' m gon na miss you . <continued_utterance> c ' mon , let ' s dance .
go on , i ' ll be out in a minute . and tell <person> to keep his dirty hands off my girl .
what ' re you gon na do , put me in a bag and bury me ?
i ' m gon na put you in the last place on earth that <person> would ever look for you .
you want this in black chips .
sure , that ' ll be fine . <continued_utterance> do you have anything smaller ?
red , i do believe you ' re talking out of your ass .
<person> what you want . these walls are funny . first you hate ' em , then you get used to ' em . after long enough , you get so you depend on ' em . that ' s `` institutionalized . ``
. `` everything that ' s going to happen to her '' . what was going to happen to her ? you hurt her . ? did y ' hit her , son . ?
hit her ? no . i . i called her . i called her a whore . i .
i ' ve been busy , mate . you alright ?
i need to get hold of some gear .
nothing .
the gun ? it ' s in the upstairs closet .
into what ?
you ' ll see her die , that ' s all . they ' re mortal , despite what she told you . she will die . then what will you do ?
what a dick .
i think he ' s cute .
yeah . i don ' t know . i have to speak to the fire marshal .
it would be very verisimilitudinous if you could .
one moment , please . <continued_utterance> as you can see on your screen , subject weapon does not exist in any known culture . markings can not be identified . <person> self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society .
excuse me ? could you try again please ?
you ' re qualified and available . and frankly , i can ' t spare a real agent right now . <continued_utterance> i don ' t expect him to talk to you , but i have to be able to say we tried . <person> was a brilliant psychiatrist , and he knows all the dodges . <person> on him , copy of our questionnaire , special id for you . if he won ' t talk , then i want straight reporting . how ' s he look , how ' s his cell look , what ' s he writing ? the director himself will see your report , over your own signature - if i decide it ' s good enough . i want that by <number> wednesday , and keep this to yourself . <continued_utterance> now . i want your full attention , starling . are you listening to me ?
yes sir .
immediately , <person> .
<person> .
<person> , he should not have been given this assignment . i ' m afraid <person> won ' t be able to protect the senator .
why ?
<person> do you think is more important , courage or confidence ?
courage , i guess .
<person> , we don ' t have watches .
sheet . did you bring ze mirror ?
do this for me or i ' ll set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face .
<person> ?
<person> ! !
thank you , jennyhaydn .
well , it ' s early in the season yet .
<person> ?
oh no . i couldn ' t let it out of my house . you ' ll have to finish it here .
it ' s getting kind of late --
<person> ' s go . time to move out .
fuck you ! <person> go of me !
<person> to interrupt again but <person> wants to know , when <person> says , `` i love ya '' , you want that to be ' ya ' , not ' you ' , right ?
right .
i ' m not like you , <person> . you ' re lucky . you ' re smart . marrying the boss ' s daughter is a nice short cut to a career , isn ' t it ?

right now you ' re in no position to ask questions ! and your snide remarks -- -
wait a minute , i haven ' t handed over punishing privileges to you yet ! put the whip down and i might respect what you ' re saying . switching his leonine tail , hunsecker looks broodingly at <person> . <person> says one beseeching word , `` <person> . `` , but no one hears him .
rejection . <person> and devastating . as long as she hasn ' t rejected me , there ' s hope .
i have lived with a secret obsession many years myself . however , i realize the other person has no interest in me -- so i pursue my career which is going even more unsuccessfully .
can you project its course ? <continued_utterance> <person> . i have nothing but sympathy for what you ' re going through . but right now , i need your full attention on the task at hand . if you can ' t provide it . then i ' ll have to relieve you of duty until <person> can remove this . emotion chip of yours . i ' m sorry , but you leave me no other choice . this snaps <person> back . he considers this for a long moment , then looks determined .
i do not wish to remove the chip , sir . although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with . i can not imagine going back to a life without them . i have taken an important step toward becoming truly human . if i were to turn back now . i would like to continue in my duties , sir .
i hope so . they haven ' t posted anything .
a job ' s come up and i thought about you . not really a job , more of - an interesting errand . walk me to my car , starling . <continued_utterance> we ' re trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody , for a psychobehavioral profile . could be a big help in unsolved cases . most of them have been happy to talk to us . they have a compulsion to boast , these people . do you spook easily , starling ?

<person> must be very busy indeed if he ' s recruiting help from the student body . <person> hunting that new one , <person> . such a naughty boy ! did crawford send you to ask for my advice on him ?
yes , sir . but the sixth rule is `` never give the enemy an advantage unnecessarily . `` if they ' re expecting us --
<person> , sergeant , this may come as news to you , but you ' re not a real hot thinker ! your pitiful efforts at tactics have cost us three men already . so turn it off , that little pea brain of yours ! that goes for all the rest of you mental giants too . all you have to do is go boom-boom . <person> ? boom-boom ! <person> kill ! say it . <person> . kill . kill . <person> in battle gear the seventeen new soldiers obediently repeat the words after her , their eyes blank and sullen . `` <person> kill kill . `` they look like somber death machines as we .

the courts know you ' re here .
so <person> opens up another past for you . a parallel past . it looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world . in essence , by sending you back , an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created . it looks identical to ours , but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality .

we ' re a habitat . not a castle . the only defense we have is <person> .

<person> , okay . thanks . <person> and i --
we ' re fine , sir . it will take some . time to explain .
i look forward to reading your report .
excuse me . i have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things .
and after they showed me the `` engine manifolds . `` then they showed me something called a `` plasma mop '' time passes . <continued_utterance> . then the `` cardassians '' put me into something called a `` garbage chute '' and i went out into space again --
that was it . we came out of the bedroom and had coffee with everybody .
you saved her life .
<person> , i am looking for-
- how ' s your voice , <person> ?
because i ' ll do anything ! please !

<person> ' t seem to remember ever owning a droid . <person> interesting . <continued_utterance> i think we better get indoors . the sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers .
<person> !
that ' s why he didn ' t get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! i put that to him , he couldn ' t answer . why didn ' t he go and direct in america , like that italian , <person> .
<person> . perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important , things like an orchestra , a school . that ' s his country . maybe he has an old mother who can ' t be left alone . maybe he has brothers , sisters . you can ' t .
we ?
yes .
like a sickness and its cure together .
yes , like rain and sun , like cold and heat . is your lady beautiful ? since i came to visit from the country , i have not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?
it ' s also our only way out of here ! it holds three people . and there ' s only three of us left now .
you , me and <person> ?
which one of those women is in charge here ?
neither of ' em . they ' re just moms .
it ' s just -- i ' ve already had two big weddings .
well , what did you have in mind ?
the scoundrel . i want to see that data , <person> !
but <person> . if i knew you were interested . sorry , i ' ve already given it to . <person> , and he is after all the head of our physics department . and i couldn ' t . ock turns sweet again . he smiles too broadly .
i ' ve seen a lot of suspicious- looking people around here today .
who ?
<person> . he had no sisters , no brothers , only a lot of love affairs .
<person> , major , why should he leave his country , his mother tongue , his family , his history , his past , his future , just because now , suddenly , there is a dictatorship ? why ?
me ? i ' m busy . just finished one script . i ' m due on another assignment .
i don ' t care .
general <person> , sir ?
at ease , lieutenant . <person> for you , for all of you . this is grand .
no .
what do you mean no ? !
is that your third question ?
it is .
but the romulans abandoned the plan .
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated . remember , he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age . he was engineered to skip thirty years of life . but since the rna sequencing was never activated , his cellular structure has started to break down . he ' s dying .
what do you mean , `` ' yes '' ?
yesssss . yes . yes . yes .
what ' s wrong with law and order ?
depends on who ' s a-dishin ' it out . never was good at takin ' orders meself . as for the law -- well , you ' ll soon find out what that means ' round these parts .
well , we ate everything without you .
we ?
<person> .
take it or leave it . <continued_utterance> no , not me . there ' ll be an elderly gent to take the bread . <continued_utterance> catch you later , copper .

but why me ?
i ' m sure you wouldn ' t care if he needed your help , right ?
why should i help that old fuck .
i ' d have thought this was the answer to your prayers . lose the witch , and her two brats , in one swoop . problems solved . <person> is clearly distraught . this is no act .
you can ' t take <person> ' s children away from him .
you little fool -- if you go to <person> with that man -- you stand to lose everything .
but why ? -- why are you being so secretive ? -- if you know something , why don ' t you tell me ?
what dp i do ?
let me take a wild and reckless guess . stick a knife in his guts and see if it ' s got a diamond in there ? i ' ll hold it still and ' you open it up .
try the wine .
i ' m partial to beer . and i don ' t have long . i came by to thank you for your help . and i apologize if you were detained . you did the right thing . trying to save him .
you had a nightmare again last night .
<person> don ' t have nightmares .
whoa .
come on , do you think i ' m doing the right thing ? tell the truth . you ' ve been through it .
i ' m here .
and tell <person> to swing away .
but . won ' t you be de-rezzed ?
probably .
<person> on the floor and put your hands behind your back .

oh ! and don ' t wave your hands about !
<person> , that sounds like a lot . i need you here .

maybe later .
that ' s the chance we have to take .
no , we don ' t .

this is <person> , the policeman assigned to protect me . <person> .
we were supposed to go to college together ! since elementary school ! what ever happened to that !
what happened to that , is that you ' re too stupid to get into the schools i did !
is it some sort of joke ? like one of those hoaxes ?
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with <number> tonnes of coral on top of it ? someone went to a lot of trouble . <person> again .
<person> pursuit .

what about insurance ? <person> ' t insurance pay for these things ?
partly . but there ' s a lot the insurance doesn ' t cover . that ' s one of the reasons we have a lawyer . to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest .
well , mr . <person> , you seem very interested in the subject of murder .
no more than anyone else . no more than you , for instance .
yes mate .
<person> ' t ever fucking come to my house again .
you are me .
no . my name is <person> . i am your brother .
<person> ' t underestimate the power of the force .
the jedi are extinct , their fire has gone out of the universe . you , my friend , are all that ' s left of their religion . <continued_utterance> yes .

moral turp . you ' re on my home court , friend . i have the mayor and the town behind me , and forget making your movie : i may own the studio when i get through with you : i got a civil suit , i got rape , i got collusion .

my lord .

. but he found you .
it isn ' t the war , ishmael . all those years growing up . you never had a real girl of your own . <continued_utterance> and i know you have it in you to love . i know that much . i wish i knew more .
i ' m sorry to hear that .
well , there ' s a price on my head . if i don ' t pay off jabba the hut , i ' m a dead man .
thank you , sir .
you know , <person> . it amazes me .
no . hillbilly , you ' d better get your wise ass outa here and quick , or you ' re gon na be in trouble . travis is being propelled by an inner force , a force which takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control .
you carry a gun ? <continued_utterance> get it .
did he have wavy hair and broad shoulders ?
i don ' t know . but maybe . a lot of the pieces in this store give me feelings . i think maybe when people own things and then they pass away -- a part of themselves gets printed on those things -- like fingerprints .
did i raise you like this ? did i raise you to give up ?
i didn ' t give up . i ' m starting something new here .
how do you know that ?
i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .

she ' s not like the others in the senate , <person> .
well , what have you got ?
nothing , i mean we got a few coins but no notes .

i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something .
mr . <person> , the word is given .
<person> , sir .
mrs . <person> , how are you going to do it ?
well , i suppose i ' ll have to get a gun from somewhere .
but that ' s what happened before .

i just stopped your heart for five seconds . it felt like an eternity , didn ' t it ? did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage ?
no . i didn ' t know that .
you can not straight up to that little jerk . <continued_utterance> and bring my knees up , real hard , yeh ?

looks like it .
i couldn ' t understand it before - pushing <person> ' s car onto the state line . makes sense now . he wanted to make the case federal . he ' s drawing us in .
no , honey . it ' s the start of something awful .
do i have to get a shot ?
i ' ll tell you if you ' ll look at this form . it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide . they said . this one likes to skin his humps .
<person> and misleading . why do you think he takes their skins , <person> ? thrill me with your wisdom .
i ' m going . my regards to vince , and the mrs . <continued_utterance> ladies .
that ' s it ! i ' m not taking it from him , and i ' m not taking it from vince ! from now on , it ' s all about me ! and if i can ' t spend it , drink it , or sleep with it -- it ' s gone . <person> used to say , `` life is short , and then you fry . `` so long , girls -- see you in church ! christy grabs the mink and heads out the door .
your watch .
oh yes , my watch . i almost forgot . <continued_utterance> splendid .

but so much is the same . on a biological level he is . and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do . i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him .
he would deny a `` human '' connection is possible . he considers himself entirely <person> .

i think my ' primo shit ' got left in my ' bellbottoms . ' <person> lighting up . <person> soulful drag .
so . she ignores this little kovitsky punk , takes the high moral ground . <continued_utterance> he ' s relentless . a major asshole .
. what was that . ? <continued_utterance> . what was your mistake . ?
. you think we bring our troubles on ourselves . ?
dr . <person> must have found it unnecessary in later versions .
it ' s possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing . mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics ?
that didn ' t leave much for <person> .
he had a great big bungalow on wheels . i had the upstairs . <person> where it says ' readers ' department ' ? i remember my walls were covered with black patent leather .
<person> ? i was trying something different . i was crashing differently . ambivalently .
i saw that . i like it . <continued_utterance> try to keep in mind that a young person playing willy <person> thinks he ' s only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair . but the tragedy is that we know that you , the young actor , will end up in this very place of desolation .

so you ' re angry . big deal .
really ? look in your ex-wife ' s eyes .
it ' s complicated for <person> . it ' s complicated for me . you don ' t have kids -- you don ' t understand --
why am i so fucking angry ? that ' s my boss ! you sleep with him after twenty minutes and now you ' re calling him up ? what ' s the matter with you ? you know he ' s got a family , right ? you know he ' s got a family ?

-- i like workin ' that way .
<person> good , <person> .
how do you like that ? we ' ve made twelve pictures together .
you could look into the glass and see the water . the way it ripples and moves . it looked so real .
sometimes , when you believe something to be real , it becomes real . <person> enough , anyway .
you need a hose but you don ' t have the time . it ' s fine that you look like that . it ' s genuine . you can use genuine .
thank you , mom .
yes , professor .
where is he ? it ' s ten past eight o ' clock .
can we talk calmly about this ?
you look me in the face and lie !
it ' s the rose bowl . miles , actual miles , of great things for sale for <person> ' s sake . we can have brunch in pasadena .

well . compared . <continued_utterance> your wife was in a red <person> which went through a guardrail over the chesapeake bay bridge . <continued_utterance> they were doin ' <number> in a fog . the <continued_utterance> car was cut in half by the impact with the rail . her male companion ' s body floated up downstream .
and petal . ?
i ' m sure you have <person> .
wish me luck .
why me ?
because you ' ll know what to do with it .
no shit .
and secondly . that woman over there . that ' s <person> , and we ' re getting married .
but he ' s been dead for three hundred . oh god . we ' ve gone back in time again , haven ' t we ?
i ' m afraid so . if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans . <person> will remain in the second dark age . an easy target when the borg arrive in the <number> th century .
they tell you everything in this book . <continued_utterance> it says they ' re probably very small -- like my height -- because , as their brains developed , there was no use for physical development . it says they ' re probably vegetarians , because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet .
who wrote this book ?
that is a theory .
that ' s exactly what it is . a theory . that evidence supports . when the suspect is in custody you can ask him yourself what happened and you won ' t need me . inspector .
new praetor ?
there ' s more . as always . he ' s <person> . believe me , we don ' t understand it either . you ' re the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say . get the lay of the land , if the empire becomes unstable , it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant .
are you crying ?
no ! yeah , so what if i am ? i ' m a fucking idiot and it was my last chance ! so i should be crying .
i guess so .
i guess you ' d have to guess . not having been there with them . having to guess whether your husband ' s report was word for word accurate .
is it .
<person> , n ' it ' s for sale . one of the few things money can buy .
screeching firedoors , curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom i still bear the scars .
we try to keep it peaceful here ; far from the madding crowd .
why are you following me ?
i ' m not following you .
you know i feel ridiculous i didn ' t mention them yesterday - i clean forgot - ridiculous .
perhaps you didn ' t mention them because there ' s only one conclusion to be drawn . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to take <person> for a little walk , <person> . mr maccarron wants to talk with you .
the invitation is fancier than the dress .
i heard that .
i have to change reels .
i said fuck off . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you gon na scream ?

time to go to ludicrous speed ! <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>

why is it moving ?
like me , it has been designed with modular power sources .
it was something my father always liked me to do .
you ' re planning to speak ?
no -- to -- it -- here . i have no real connection to our life here .
what life here ? seriously -- all i do is work -- and you run off to new york every chance you get .
<person> ' s got twenty minute delays and they ' re working on both bridges .
what else did he say about the device ? did he describe it at all ? anything about a button , or a cord , or .
no . i didn ' t say that .
then what , <person> ?
woah !
so , how ' d it go last night ?
what ' s wrong with you tonight ?
something came up . i don ' t want to talk about it .
ohhh . <person> news , kid . i hate to disappoint you , but this is the reason they call me <person> . i ' m the plumber around here . <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>
oh , boy . <person> , i ' m from california , and i can surf , i just don ' t know what to expect from the wave on <person> . i . i was just hoping you could help , i really am sorry for bothering you .
<person> , sure . and look . <person> . <person> . <person> granite . there ' s some graded limestone , from when they cut this place out of the hill .
so ?
<person> . <person> .
<person> ? well , that answers everything . why the hell are we -- they dematerialize .
ah , see , that ' s the thing . somehow they don ' t come back until you really don ' t care anymore .
there ' s the rub .
yes .
where did you come from ? <continued_utterance> how are you here ?
you couldn ' t look better .
thank you . come on in .
so he was mean ?
no . not mean . just . very angry .
did his parents attend to that ?
what do you mean ?
and they loved <person> .
oh yes . like i said , they always came out together to see him off to school . it ' s like he was their little treasure . he was such a beautiful boy . that ' s a picture of him on the wall there , behind abbott . mitchell turns around to find the picture of bear .
we ' re going to win this .
walk in the park . and thanks for the ' we ' .
then we ' re in the same place that we ' re in right now !
it ' s fucking humiliating ! everyone in the store sees them kicking me out . what if they make me put all the liquor back on the shelf ? i can ' t do that !
no it ' s true . i can ' t find ' him , but i know a man that can . <continued_utterance> tony . <person> . he ' ll find <person> for you .
who ' s he ?
what took you so long ?
oh , you know , <person> , i couldn ' t find a speeder i really liked , with an open cockpit . and with the right speed capabilities . and then you know i had to get a really gonzo color .
however , we can also pray for other things .
measles .
yeah .
i thought i was going to die .
you are . you ' re losing your mind . what about <person> ?
i ' m going to marry <person> . i just have to get this out of my system .
what does <person> care of that ? he is readying the curtain for <person> .
you have opened the playhouses ?
you know my name ?
<person> , listen to me . there ' s something i have to tell you .
no , i ' m not going to stop it . <person> himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter .
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter .
pittsburgh .
i ain ' t ever been there , but it don ' t seem like such a bad place .
<person> ' t say that <person> . you ' re the closest thing i have to a father . i love you . i don ' t want to cause you pain .
then why don ' t you listen to me ? !
i got ta move the smaller stones here ; it shouldn ' t take me long . i ' l l be a couple of days .
speak to my cousin <person> .
what do you think ? you want to marry me , don ' t you ?
she didn ' t know she was pregnant .
<person> well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you . <person> <number> .
<person> , <person> , thanks a whole bunch . thanks for sticking me in a convent . so you think , after all this , maybe i really am a nun ?
it wasn ' t my fault ! they just showed up . it ' s helping the convent .
you ' re supposed to be hiding out !
useless distractions .
it ' s like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?
oh , okay .
you believe that ?
i treated you like a son or nephew .
it ' s no you , it ' s .
so it ' s not crazy for a man to do something entirely out of character after having a heart attack ?
like crying ?
that ' s between you and yourself , norma .
you think i made that up about the gun . <continued_utterance> see , you didn ' t believe me ! . now i suppose you don ' t think i have the courage !
in one goddamn night ? what are ya sprayin ' money around like that for ?
i checked the place out . there weren ' t no dicks in there .
no .
if this is going to get all heavy --
how could you see his face in the dark ?
i did not do this . i saw two guys fighting and should of ran the other way but i didn ' t . you need to find the person who killed this man . you need to find the guy who did this .
if you think i ' m enjoying this , you ' re wrong .
what ' s their offer ? what can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally fucking me ? spit it out , you spineless turd .
. i know , i ' m so . because i said : yes , a woman who . the . the community respects her . please don ' t go . please don ' t go . what can i do but beseech you . ? trauma , toil . when are we free of them . ? when . ?
he treated me as if i were a child .
we all go through slumps you know .
it wasn ' t a slump .
i need a wrestler with a masters .
what ' s this ? <continued_utterance> from you ? <continued_utterance> is it wrestling tights ?
uh-huh . did he ask you to come alone ?
no , <person> .
dr . <person> of <person> .
<person> , are we on the air ?
<person> , it doesn ' t make any difference . <person> aren ' t allowed to marry . you swore an oath , remember ? you ' d be expelled from the order . i will not let you give up your responsibilities .
i was destined to be a <person> . i don ' t think i could be anything else . but you are asking me to be rational . that is something i know i can not do . i wish i could wish my feelings away . but i can ' t .
why not ? he ' s fit . i ' d do him .
<person> - he ' s my uncle .
i have . many times . i didn ' t sleep . i counted .
so what ' s the damage . total ?
erm .
<person> .
the big crowd watching .
guy scores point over reynolds .
yes . like i was putting them into my big basket . clearing the hillside of its children . <continued_utterance> <person> and i used to do a lot of that in the spring .
berry-picking .
three minutes and counting .
take her , come on . just --
so does your son .
even better news for him . wavey you think so . <continued_utterance> herold i can ' t undo the hurt i ' ve done . unless you let me . <continued_utterance> there ' s a million reasons to send me away . good ones . and only two reasons not to . <continued_utterance> i love you . and you love me .
but it ' s not , it ' s a dog and i have never done a dog .
my heart bleeds .
still . <person> like we could figure out . something .
a friend told me once . <person> is the only thing that counts . he nods . almost to himself . quoyle it ' s the engine of life . <continued_utterance> so when you told me how you think about your husband . i really understood , becau .
yeah , having supper with the mrs . she ' s over there . <continued_utterance> he ' s somewhere .
thanks , i see him .
something happened , didn ' t it ?
yes , it did .
you ' re welcome <person> .
i worked so long that night . i ain ' t never fallen asleep driving before . and never since . most of the ride home , there wasn ' t a car insight in either direction . if i ' d fallen asleep then , i ' d a ended up in a ditch with a head ache . it had to happen at that right moment . that certain ten-fifteen seconds when i passed her walking . it was like it was meant to be . <continued_utterance> i guess if this is the end of the world , i ' m screwed right ? people who kill reverends ' wives aren ' t exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven .
countdown to what ?
i don ' t know , but whatever it is , it ' s only six hours away .
as i said , it is beyond our comprehension .
as i said , then it ' s <person> , right ? <continued_utterance> why are we talking about this shit when we could be fucking ? <person> smiles .
norma , grow up . you ' re a woman of fifty . there ' s nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five .
i ' m the greatest star of them all .
. shivering .
. and you ' re just looking at your claws like `` how do i kill this bunny ? '' .
<person> has gone into real estate .
really ?
i don ' t even know you , <person> . now we ' ll extend you ever courtesy , just soon as we can , but for right now -
<person> , this , ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects i ' d rather discuss just between the two of us . know what i mean ?
you believe in the same ideals we believe in ! the same ideals we are striving to make prominent .
if what you say is true , you should stay in the republic and help <person> put things right .
normal is what everyone else is .
what do you want ?
ja , mada chod . he ' s not looking for you . ja !
i need to see him . <continued_utterance> i killed <person> . i ' ll kill you too . <person> .
and what precisely am i supposed to know ?
come on ! you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me .
i ' d love to , but .
<person> off the winter blues . come celebrate the spring .
none of which i am consciously aware -- except , of course , happy birthday -- surely the best of times .
<person> . and where are you off to , now ?
i don ' t know you , but i ' ll be honest with you . i don ' t like this . i don ' t like any of this . especially , the water .
<person> ? a marine biologist ?
i quit .
you quit .
you burn him , you lose any chance you ever had .
it ' s lose-lose from here on in , who said that ?
for the next sailing of the mary . <person> ' s run down - she ' s never been abroad and as you so cogently put it , i ' m not made of iron . <person> slowly pushes the envelope back to hunsecker , who leaves it lying on the table before him .
that ' s good . now that louse is outa <person> ' s hair for good .
well what are you waiting for ?
the five quid you are going to pay me .
oh yeah . who cares ? i ' m the queen of typos . <person> , this is really starting to open up . what do you think ?
my palate ' s kind of shot , but from what i can tell , i ' d dub it pretty damn good .

the chancellor means well , <person> ' lady but he is incompetent . he has promised to cut the bureaucracy , but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever , no ? senator , the republic can not be fixed . it is time to start over . the democratic process in the republic is a sham , a shell game played on the voters . it will not be long before the cult of greed , called the republic , will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom .
i can not believe that . i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic . i know of your treaties with the trade federation , the commerce guilds , and the others , count . what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business . it ' s business becoming government !

i ' m glad you asked . i didn ' t want to be so forward . i mean , if you ' re waiting inside , then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite , and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there ' s the chance that you would really want to talk and it ' s me who ' d be busy , but in an attempt not to be rude , i sit there and listen to some story that you don ' t really want to tell and i don ' t really have time to hear . you know ?

of course i ' ll be calling to keep you in check , make sure your grades don ' t slip .
look who ' s talking . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
it ' s my belief that <person> was doing exactly what she ' d been doing for years . besides , the school board ' s insurance on <person> is minimal . a few million at the very most . the really deep pockets are to be found in the town , or in the company that made the bus .
you think someone else caused the accident ?
so .
so <person> opens up another past for you . a parallel past . it looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world . in essence , by sending you back , an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created . it looks identical to ours , but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality .
it ' s okay . i was a street cop in philadelphia for three years before i joined the fbi .
<person> nice . you like to play games .
where you been geezer , i ' ve been trying to get hold of you .

<person> fazeli never helps anybody but himself .
he ' s my father , <person> .
no . get in .
you can have one . <continued_utterance> are you angry at me ?
<person> is a different medium .
you said <person> did not invent theater to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering which of them will go to <person> .
for you . this is where you wanted to be .
but i never had a wife , children , a home like this .
of course . she introduced me to myself . to my vagina and to hers .
you have no idea how evil she is .
<person> ' s find a place out of the rain . i ' m sure we ' ll get a ride in the morning .
i can ' t be late . i don ' t know if the radio balloons work above your planet . i don ' t know if my words went to the ship . if i ' m not there , the captain will think i ' m dead and go .

<person> me help you with that . <continued_utterance> i ' m looking for <person> .
for <person> ' s sake . you got some disease ? you force me back to this shit-hole , we leave our friends , a good life , loads of money- for this . <person> ' t that enough ?
we came back to find her .
she ' s not gon na know .
she wired this system .
did she accept ?
you don ' t like it , do you . i think she will accept , but i ' m not sure . she may be too dependent on her brother .
<person> . <person> ' t forget to put some clothes on .
i mean , i should go out , shouldn ' t i ? since . when don ' t i go out ? just cause some emergency room doctor tells me to stay in bed , doesn ' t mean i have to turn into a monk .
exactly . that ' s why it ' s a make- able deal .
<person> . that tape is a lightning bolt from god . it ' s worth more than you , more than me , more than <person> . you understand ? it can change things . things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road . and you do not have the right to use it for currency . you go . you go alone . this is where i draw the line . i care about you <person> . a lot more than you know . which makes us both pretty stupid . but you pawn that tape , you mean nothing to me . <person> doesn ' t know what to say . tough choice . he clenches his jaw . <continued_utterance> ah , hell . <person> --
fifty dollars is a lot of money .
<person> . right . <continued_utterance> ah , shit .
no .

you have no authorization to be making this call . <person> .
no ! <person> ! <person> ' t hang up ! forget authorization . there ' s no time . soon you ' re going to find out what happened on this train . and then your own day is going to start . but not until then . right now it ' s just you and me talking . and you ' re a different <person> than the one i ' m going to go back to in a few minutes . you ' re separate from him . separate worlds . do you understand ?
that ' s enough , i think . <person> hunting . oh , and <person> - next time you will tell me why you ran away . shall i summarize ?
yes , <person> . please .
they ' re not his neighbor , like you are . he is a husband , a father , he risked his <continued_utterance> well , folks are pretty cold . and folks who believe in nothing else . they ' re cold , too . <continued_utterance> i ' ve tried to understand your unhappiness , all these years . having gone to war , losing your arm . <continued_utterance> but other boys came back . and pushed on . they found girls , and married , had babies .
someday i ' ll get lucky , too .

<person> . no such thing as easy time in the hole . a week seems like a year .
i had mr . <person> to keep me company . <person> felt the time at all .

first off , if there ' s one , there ' s more . that ' s how it is , soldiers travel in bunches . second , they don ' t waste soldiers on folks like us , that ' s for police ! training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call `` cost effective . ``

i invited him to a party .
<person> saw him . <person> caught him in the act , caught him being martin <person> . <person> first by his mother , then by <person> . for the first time he ' s failed at taking a life , and since we found the apartment , he can ' t be <person> . to be seen , to be recognized , is a horrifying thing to <person> . he has no identity and wants it that way .
where is the real mr . <person> ?
i would be interested to know what we are talking about .
<person> , captain ! tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people . federation and romulan . <person> and vulcan and <person> and <person> . i ' m speaking of the thing that makes us the same . we want peace . <continued_utterance> i want to end the centuries of mistrust . i want to be your ally , not your enemy . as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas .

it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger . not their grief .
who did they get for that ?

<person> was born in two hours , went right to my breast and camped there for three days . always with this . mischievous look . <continued_utterance> somehow , his blanket always looked like a cape , even the nurse said that . he <continued_utterance> took <number> hours . she just wasn ' t sure about entering this world . <continued_utterance> the doctor wanted to go in and get her , but i knew she ' d come in her own time . <continued_utterance> that ' s who she is . <person> ' t let anybody rush her .
i ' ll keep that in mind .
you didn ' t need to kill him .
what ? typical . i save your life and you ' re on at me . all you ever do is mess us up . whenever you ' re around-
<person> , i know you ' re not happy about this . but it wasn ' t my idea for your father to have some kind of mid-life crisis and disappear with his secretary to mexico with our life savings .
`` <person> . `` there ' s no such thing as a secretary anymore .
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon .
or . ?
maybe you weren ' t thinking for once and look what a good time we had . <person> ' s not ruin something great .

<person> , perhaps you are correct .
if he ' s not sleeping . why do they call it a awake ? he thinks . as if it is a worthwhile question .
we ' re the ones have to be awake . to how much we love him . <continued_utterance> and how we should be good to each other . while we have the chance . <continued_utterance> you think ?
oh really ? nothing ? my dad doesn ' t do anything unless there ' s something in it for him .

<person> where he went ?
we ' ll probably hear of another dame murdered .
<person> , that ' s a thing of beauty , honest to god , a real thing of beauty . i ' m going to try to remember that . <person> , humanity and justice . <person> . but you used the word ' naive ' . are you now saying you think you were wrong ? that art and politics can ' t be separated ?
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they weren ' t kept separate i learned to my cost .
that depends .
well , when you do go to sleep : barricade your door .
but very cold .
that one .
well , what ' s your theory ?
i ' m a woman . i don ' t theorize . i only deal with facts .

it ' s too dangerous with all the sandpeople around . we ' ll have to wait until morning .

so you ran away .
no , i ' m not laughing .
you think that ' s silly ?
get the fuck out of my house .
what the fuck did i do ?
you have a shiny head .
he is very observant .
i couldn ' t kill <person> . i need his help . theo helps <person> load suitcases into the trunk of her car .
<person> fazeli never helps anybody but himself .
thanks . <person> , she ' s quite a character , that <person> .
she was the greatest . you wouldn ' t know . you are too young . in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters . men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails . there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings . later , he strangled himself with it .
<person> .
right . <person> is one of the oldest cities in the country . a lot of generations have lived and died in this city . almost every place you visit has a history and a story behind it . even this school and the grounds they sit on . can anyone guess what this building was used for a hundred years ago , before you went here , before i went to this school even ? <continued_utterance> yes , <person> ?
what , just the three of us ?
you know anybody that ' s got an army for rent , that ' s fine . but my , uh , <person> said to go take that sucker out . an ' let ' s face it , the big ox isn ' t gon na get any weaker . i feel like hittin ' him now , while i ' m good an ' mad . some nerve . what does he care whether you guys get killed , long as he keeps rakin ' in quarters ?
to the next fifty .
and there , in the same city where they met as girls , four new york women entered the next phase of their lives . dressed head to toe in love . <continued_utterance> and that ' s the one label -- that never goes out of style .
my cigarette lighter . he said once he could have left it on the islands as evidence but he wouldn ' t do that . not in broad day light .
but he ' s going somewhere , <person> . he told his mother --
then you may remain so long as you remain silent . pay attention and you will see how genius creates a legend .
thank you , sir .
<person> till tuesday . <continued_utterance> here -- time to re-join the world .
<person> ?
so , why do they call you <person> ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
well it ' s like this . it started cause i ' m sweet with the ladies . but mostly it ' s cause i got the sweetest knuckle curve in the whole republic .

they suspended me for <number> years .
<number> years !
more bullshit ! more bullshit ! what kind of odds are they giving me ? there must be some kind of office pool . one month ? a couple of days ?
easy . easy . i ' m not gon na leave you alone like this . <continued_utterance> i ' m not gon na let anything happen to you .
well <person> , i ' ve never seen it that way . for me police work is all about following procedure and remaining accountable to the general public .
captain ! when i joined the police force , i thought i was going to be serpico and unfortunately i ended up being <person> . i would have settled for <person> .
i just hate to see you pining away . it makes me want to vomit , frankly . <person> hearts are for assholes .
hey , iris , you okay ?
oh , this is me . no , it ' s okay . she fell . <person> in her bathroom . hit her head . it actually split in half . horrible .
in half ?

better question , where you ' ve been so long , do you like girls ?
you should go talk to her .
ok . ok . count me down .
<person> , but if i get yelled at , i ' m never gon na listen to this show again .
<person> enough .
to the jungle ! where outa the blue some shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole day .
you were lucky , <person> .
anything ' s possible . <person> , please listen .
you listen . we live in a real world . come back to it . you ' re studying to become a <person> knight . i ' m a senator . if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion , they will take us to a place we can not go . regardless of the way we feel about each other .
it is not my riding day , my lord .
bless me , i thought it was a horse .
and they get caught !
that ' s right . so all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes .
a gesture of friendship . but . we thought : if you see some of the yemenins - any of these , in particular . would you say <person> to them ?
who else have you done a favor for , <person> ?
so who am i interviewing ?
her .
would you follow me , please . the general is expecting you .
there is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of an army than policing its own citizens .
but if they do , you must realise there aren ' t enough <person> to protect the republic . we are keepers of the peace , not soldiers .
<person> , do you think it will really come to war ?

his hatred of the federation is apparent . he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason . he is going after earth .
oh boy . destroy humanity and the federation is crippled .

far as them republican boys in augusta are concerned , there ' s only three ways to spend the taxpayer ' s hard-earned when it come to prisons . more walls . more bars . more guards .

i love my country , i believe in music , what was i to do ?
<person> around you . <person> the country you served . <person> at people who had real courage , who took risks , who risked their lives . like <person> ' s father . <continued_utterance> <person> , take your fingers out of your ears ! <continued_utterance> i ' m talking about your father .
red . i ' m <person> . pleasure doing business with you .

you knew enough to tell <person> that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
just wondering .
are you nervous ?
but who says you will . i got a guy i can depend on . he ' s liquidating everything he has for this . you wouldn ' t even give carver his money back .
i need more proof , that ' s all .
so , when did you get so sane ?
when i realized how insane i ' ve been all this time tryin ' to be like <person> and <person> . and you and <person> . i ' m not part of this post-college georgetown life ; marriage and jobs . <person> and <person> ' ll be better off without me .

i made no deal !
i don ' t buy that .
the orderly heard <person> whispering to him , all afternoon , and <person> crying . they found him at bed check . he ' d swallowed his own tongue . <person> is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit , and he ' s trying to blame it on you . i told the little prick your conduct was flawless . starling . ?

we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours . there must be some design schematics . blueprints .
we ' re tearing this place apart looking for them . but the computers are down , and the fires destroyed half the files . so far , nothing . <continued_utterance> if it was just part of the warp drive , i ' d know what to do . but this . it ' s like trying to rebuild <person> ' s airplane with canvass and sticks .
i guess it was meant to be .
does it hurt ?
only a couple hundred bucks . i ' ll give you half .

<person> didn ' t tell me you had a big mouth .

<person> , mr . <person> , could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself , as a personal loan ?
probably . in my case it ' s probably a whole building .
then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key , say
oh , ' cause the phone doesn ' t ring as much at night and the `` alone '' thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to . but i got the hang of it . you got ta sleep in the middle of the bed . it ' s absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side .
<person> , now i ' m convinced what i think of you is right . you are a tower of strength .
but honey , i need to know where i can reach you or i ' ll be worried sick . it turns out i can ' t stay up here . the electricity ' s off . and i don ' t know just where i ' ll be .

will we see you later ?
how would you know that ?
he told me everything . i was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago , so i . i ' m going to go now , i think . unless he meant
why not ?
because i can see what you ' re thinking .

i hate to disappoint you , pal , most-the time , that ' s how it is for users , too .
great .
i look stupid . i look stupid , don ' t i ? i look like i ' m trying too hard . i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i ' d look like i just got a haircut .
why not ?
and if i could describe it , it probably wouldn ' t be on a radio show . but what the hell . it ' s not one specific thing . it ' s more of a feeling . <continued_utterance> you touch her for the first time , and suddenly . you ' re home . it ' s almost like .
i hope it wasn ' t cheap .
oh , it was .
<person> ? will they die ?
difficult to see . always in motion is the future .

i came this far alone . we came this far alone . we require no assistance from the fleet . now leave me to my thoughts . <continued_utterance> are we prepared ?
oh , you want to -- hah . i could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . they hate this tower . they ' d close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . and you should hear the way they commune ! sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . no , i don ' t think you <person> steps closer , speaks quietly to <person> .
<person> . my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again .
is that what ' s affecting your performance ?
i ' m not being unpatriotic , and i ' m doing my damndest to catch them . bell ' s up on <number> and i ' m down here on <number> past grand junction . they ' re heading west . if they ' re not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them . all i ' m asking is that you people think about it .

why didn ' t you `` bus a cap in his ass '' then <person> ? mind you , you would do more damage if you threw it at him .
<person> ' t have to be now . <person> ' s go taste .
i owe her a call anyway . <continued_utterance> hey , honey . so we ' re up here about to taste some whites , and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon . <continued_utterance> no , i know , i didn ' t forget , but we wound up at <person> ' s mom ' s house , and it got really late , and it was hard to call , so i ' m calling you now . i said i was sorry . yes , i did . you heard me say i was sorry , right ? <continued_utterance> <person> heard me say i was sorry . <continued_utterance> give me a break , will you ? i just called to find out about the salmon -- for our wedding -- to be more involved , like you said -- and all you want to do is get into it about last night and , okay , i ' m sorry . i ' m sorry i didn ' t call . you ' re totally right . i know , but i ' m trying to make this the best wedding i can with the best wine we can find . <person> ' t i get any credit for that ? okay . <person> , i ' ve got to go . i ' m out here in the parking lot , and <person> is waiting for me .
i don ' t know . someone .
you ?
well , for one thing , he thinks j . j .
<person> , she studies <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t you ?
<person> tracked ?
that above and beyond guy was there . <person> . we got talking shop and --
ever feel like you ' re not accomplishing anything ?
i think i ' m in touch with the feeling . <person> ' s go get a drink .
<person> --
go back . i ' m going to kill him .
that boy is our last hope .
no . there is another .
i am old enough to . to make my own --
but i didn ' t feel like getting to know your roaches .
we ' re not going to a singing lesson , she ' s just gon na start taking singing lessons .
so , what are you doing tonight ?
<person> at me , <person> ! do you feel the blood pumping inside you ? your hands , your eyes , your nature , are the same as mine . <person> deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you ' ve forgotten . it ' s the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it ' s the very thing that truly defines us . to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are . <continued_utterance> i know you as well as i know myself , <person> . there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be .
long ago .
one thing . go ahead .
thanks . <person> , you ' re going to lose your husband and you ' ll never find someone as good . there will only be men who you know are cheap and shallow and have no real warmth in their souls . you may have gotten by on those surfaces once but now you ' ve been spoiled by a good man and you can no longer glide on such thin ice . if you do not act quickly you will soon cement an awful fate for yourself . a life , with no hope of repair , which has already begun to turn desperate and dumb . that ' s it . <person> safely .
no , wait . they ' ll hear !
come here , you big coward ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! come here !
that ' s not news , <person> .
no . but this is . they wouldn ' t take my blood .
oh . <person> . that ' s good then . <continued_utterance> my son-in-law ' s coming to take me to lunch at the <person> ' s . they have such nice rolls there .
would you like to sit for a moment , mrs . <person> ?
yes . please do .
i ' ve fantasized about <person> dying and being able to start again .
it ' ll never be over , will it ? look at me , i ' m shaking . some legend , huh ? you must be pretty disappointed .
no . i ' m not .
she was there . the girl was there . i ' m going back . i want you to do something .
what would that be ?
enough for a room ?
<person> . maybe an apartment .
the kind that puts really big holes in people .
was it black ? was it silver ?
yes you fucking are !
i didn ' t give birth to you ! i didn ' t bring you into this world .
well , <person> has <person> , <person> , <person> , <person> , the high and <person> bridge- which is pronounced <person> , so-
i thought you hadn ' t been to uk .
could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town ?
yes .
he ' s no concern of mine , as long as you don ' t talk to him . <person> ' t talk to anybody . you understand ? not with everything that ' s going on right now .
you ' re too goddamned paranoid .
let him be damned for his pages !
oh -- no , no !
are you afraid ?
yes .
can you stop it ?
maybe . with these weapons .
and what of the enterprise ?
i have little interest in your quaint vessel , captain . if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years , it will not be harmed .
well , your mother just said she could use my help on a few errands while you ' re in class . <continued_utterance> what ?
no . just that i hate summer school .
well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he ' s starin ' at me with these narrow eyes .
when your son came back from the war , what did he say about all this ?
do you have a moment , sir ?
of course , sit down . he sits at his desk she sits across from him .
romeo and juliet -- just a suggestion .
thank you , <person> . <continued_utterance> you are a gentleman .
. no , but --
-- but you have hard evidence linking this apartment to the people that blew up bus <number> -- ?
oh fuck .
how ' d you get in ?
i ' m sick .
we ' re out of ambulances , miss , but we ' ll send a taxi . please wait in front of your house , miss .
still , she ' s got a lot of spirit . i don ' t know , what do you think ? do you think a princess and a guy like me .
no !
no . it was you . you had some manila folders and a pink bag from saks .
you ' re right ! now i remember ! it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late . the next day i was completely bushed . it was unbelievable .
what was i thinking ?
maybe you weren ' t thinking for once and look what a good time we had . <person> ' s not ruin something great .
what ' d you say her name was -- your wife ' s ?
<person> .
. driving him . ? did you say `` him '' ?
yeah . it ' s a man ' s world , pal - but you ' re in the wrong bar .
<person> way did he do , <person> ?
straight north . he was gon na take it all and run .
what a dirty trick .
it ' s just <person> ' s way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there . consider it a rookie initiation .
forgive me for saying so , <person> , but your methods are too . shall we say . soft ? as head of the pta , i am exercising my right under article <number> of the pta code .
<person> <number> ! you don ' t mean- ? !
what do you want ?
you ' re being tricked . <person> picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors . he ' s figured out they ' re made of subatomic particles called neutrinos , and he ' s going to create a negative neutrino field . twenty four hours a day , until they ' re back on earth .
i guess we ' re skipping the tearful reunion . have a seat , <person> .
how ' s things back at the ranch ?
now tip it . what you ' re doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim . tells you how old it is , among other things , usually more important with reds . this is a very young wine , so it ' s going to retain its color pretty solidly . now stick your nose in it . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t be shy . get your nose in there . <continued_utterance> what do you smell ?
i don ' t know . wine ? fermented grapes ?
<person> ' t that be on record ?
it ought to be . unless it was very recent . i hate to say it , but it looks like the system you ' re searching for doesn ' t exist .
now , sir . we did take care of that user you sent us --
yes , and now you ' ve got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation .
definitely old .
that ' s <person> , alright . how many y ' need ?
and <person> ?
he ' s pitching now . you should see him , <person> , got an arm like his brother .
you have to do something .
it ' s awful .
<person> ' s just say you don ' t seem the ambivalent type .
is that right ?
i don ' t want to know .
i find it really insulting that you would assume that it has to be a guy . this movie star ' s son could have had a relationship with a girl in
why don ' t they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary ?
i don ' t know . maybe they don ' t leave a canary . <person> ' t be technical . what i ' m saying is if this newsstand guy ' s italian and his fingers are gone , maybe he ' s a thief .
well , maybe you weren ' t .
<person> , when i said i couldn ' t channel you . that didn ' t mean i wouldn ' t give my right arm to do just that . <continued_utterance> maybe i don ' t want to be looking over my shoulder . every day for twenty years . knowing someone else would have done it right . the way i can ' t .
i know . <continued_utterance> are you afraid of him , <person> ?
yes . god knows where he ' s been . or what he ' s done . <continued_utterance> i ' ve never been afraid of anyone before . not this way . i feel he could break me in half . with no real effort and no real . feeling .
aw christ , it doesn ' t make no difference now . if snyder knows about it so does everybody else . he never gets anything first . <person> , there ' s no answer at luther ' s .
<person> to me , hooker . what ever you do , don ' t go back to your place tonight , don ' t go anyplace you usually go , ya hear me ? get outa town or somethin ' , but .
did you forget where i live ? it ' s four o ' clock .
i just woke up . i ' m sorry .
a juice tiger ?
aye , it ' s a juicer . it ' s part of my national enquirer , <person> diet . would you like potato juice ?
what would you think of me if -
nothing i didn ' t think of you before .
you ' re full of tricks , aren ' t you ? <continued_utterance> we need gas . <continued_utterance> no gas .
no gas .
no i don ' t . i keep asking because i feel fat .
oh g-d , i ' m sorry . you ' re not really fat ! i was just saying that because , uh , i thought that ' s what you wanted me to say .
is there shrimp on it ?
yes .
are you thick ?
what ?
<person> ' t you afraid the empire ' s going to find out about this little operation and shut you down ?
that ' s always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we ' ve built here . but things have developed that will insure security . i ' ve just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever .
am not !
are so !
<person> . i got business to do , theo . i ' ll come back and haunt you later . <person> ' t say i never gave you nothing .
do those two work for your dad or mine ?
that ' s not news , <person> . that ' s bullshit . i wouldn ' t wipe my ass with that paper .
what are you talking about ? it ' s the fifth highest circulating paper in the united states , i ' ll have you know .
<person> . i wonder why it didn ' t show up in any analysis archive .
it ' s these funny little cuts on the side give it away . those analysis droids you ' ve got over there only focus on symbols , you know . i should think you <person> would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom .
was i ? i ' m sorry .
what ' s wrong with you tonight ?
one-zero-four-nine-three-three- one . or d ' you mind if i just call you ' one ' ? <continued_utterance> you know what i say you are , <person> ? i say you ' re a piece of shit .
that bastard ! people by the lakeside:
o ' <person> . he left his file on my doorstep . <person> , he was fbi .
that ' s impossible .
how can i know such a thing ?
i ' ll tell you , then . the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal <person> had shot himself . <person> to it . they listen . did they pick little k ' s recording ? did they pick some other conductor ? no , they picked you , and why ? because you represented them so beautifully . when the devil died , they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march . you were everything to them .
no . but you were . she found you .
she found me ? what does that mean ? she stops . not wanting to go on . <continued_utterance> <person> , christina , are you going to spit it out ?
oh my god -- did you just hear lily ?
hey -- i need to talk . <continued_utterance> i ' m sitting here trying to write these vows and . is this something we really want to do ?
<person> place in the world . you think <person> would look for you here ?
nuns , <person> . there are nuns here . everywhere . it ' s crawling with ' em .
why are you so into <person> ? it ' s like a thing with you .
i don ' t know . it ' s a hard grape to grow . as you know . it ' s thin-skinned , temperamental , ripens early . it ' s not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected . <person> needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world . and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really , can tap into <person> ' s most fragile , delicate qualities . only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can <person> be coaxed into its fullest expression . and when that happens , its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet . <continued_utterance> i mean , cabernets can be powerful and exalting , but they seem prosaic to me for some reason . by comparison . how about you ?
who for then what ?
well , you looked at your watch and said it wasn ' t late for you . i wondered who it was late for .
pity . !
oh , come on , <person> , be a good sport . <person> ' s talk this over face to face . throw me a line . spidey reaches out .
-- <person> ' t work .
works for the israelis .
you hungry ?
we ordering in -- ?
now , you make a toast .
to new worlds .
no way .
you alright ? y ' okay ?
<person> ? oh , hey , honey . how you doing ? uh-huh . uh-huh . <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> , honey . <person> me call you back . <person> and i are in the middle of something . no , it ' s nothing serious -- <person> is just having one of his freak- outs . yeah . love you too . i ' ll call you right back .
this whole week has gone sour . it isn ' t turning out like it was supposed to . i want to go home .
what `` plans ? '' you and <person> got `` plans ? ''
she ' s taking singing lessons .
have you considered that he might also be in bed with the other side ?
<person> in bed with them ? that would too much to wish for .
is that what she used to sing ?
i miss her . what do you think happens to someone after they die ?
why did you quit ?
actually , i ' m not sure if i quit . i think that i got fired . i ' m such a liar . i never could tell the truth .
now be careful , <person> . <continued_utterance> he made a fair move . screaming about it won ' t help you .
let him have it . it ' s not wise to upset a wookiee .
why not just bring the whole toilet ?
ben likes to be read to . do you know dr . <person> . ?
i am against it . it wasn ' t my call .
`` i ' m only following orders '' didn ' t work at nuremberg . it may not be your policy but they ' re your tactics .
all of us .
where is he now ?
they used to hang people here .
that ' s not correct . where ' d you hear that ?
i don ' t . i don ' t believe it .
that is why you fail .
i . i think that ' s right .
. you think that ' s right .
well , anything coulda caused that .
anything . that had a blond hair .
it ' s always politics . like this thing we ' re in here , he ' s paying you to tune me up , right ? but i could pay you more not to . see what i mean ? i could write you a check right now --
come on , let ' s go , i got to get back .
<person> . can you get her ?
no problem . take a few weeks .
how fast would you say mrs . <person> was going ? to the best of your recollection ?
seventy-two miles an hour .
what ? ! when ?
the other day . i have it here .
<person> , what a woman .
<person> ' t do very well , did you ?
i saw you crushing the crusher .
you like wrestling ?
whose show was this on ?
jed ' s got cables .
but i ' m ready . come on .
is that - i mean - are you wearing that ?
i know - that ' s what i said too . <person> , we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank .
well , shit-fire , <person> , that ' s the sweetest goddamn thing ever .
about what ?
that would be between me and <person> , wouldn ' t it ?
a death mark ' s not an easy thing to live with . you ' re a good fighter , <person> . i hate to lose you .
thank you , general . <continued_utterance> well , <person> , i guess this is it .
<person> . i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player . <continued_utterance> `` what light is light , if silvia be not seen , what joy is joy , if silvia be not by ? unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection . <continued_utterance> `` except i be by silvia in the night , there is no music in the nightingale . unless i look on silvia in the day , there is no day for me to look upon . `` will interrupts `` him . ``
take off your hat .
very slick .
do you like the colour ?
you can bring them with a word .
oh , not for the world ! <continued_utterance> <person> , nurse !
<person> , i just want you to know , you ' re the only one i can talk to about her .
<person> . <person> , man .
no !
`` no '' ?
that stuff ' s bullshit , they ' re all faking it . and plus , your parents are gon na look at the bill .
it shows up under a different name . i hope . <person> .
i saw <person> , leaning on the bank of the building . said , `` what are you doin ' ? '' he said , `` i ' m waitin ' for the ' leven o ' clock crossing . ``
y ' wan na fix something , you should fix the pothole . <person> , they should be trussed up , thrown off some high building .
integrity - acute , like indigestion .
what does that mean - integrity ?
seven years .
this scam we got going here was your <continued_utterance> brainstorm , <person> . i admit , i thought it was a rotten idea , but i put up the scratch . and now we got a beautiful thing .
she works for tips !
you ' re blind , dude . <person> .
no .
well , i got one strike at least .
that far in what , <person> ? <person> doesn ' t say anything . <person> waiting .
you shouldn ' t be here , <person> . it ' s too dangerous for you and the others to be down here .
how long would you need it for ?
i ' ll be gone a week . but i could wire it back to you .
they all wind up like you ? the other agents ?
no . they ' re dead now . <continued_utterance> they broke down . then they opted out . killed themselves . after a while , those conversations about the yankees became impossible . ya see ?
<person> . well . all i got ' s the data but they ' ve agreed to publish it when it ' s finished . you know . it ' s my calculation on the planetary conjunction .
and its influence on the anti-force .
just didn ' t get around to it , huh ?
oh , <person> , please .
i don ' t know , man . i ' m getting , like , really nervous .
are you okay ?
um .
it would be verisimilitudinous .
in all that time , have you ever had an assistant ?
never needed one . not much to it , is there ?
there ' s no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot .
what a dirty trick .
this is where you live ?
you bet .
-- just because you went to night school , or filled out the back of a matchbook or whatever you did to get a law degree doesn ' t make you <person> .
just because you talk the talk doesn ' t make you an expert . and just because you read my file doesn ' t make you an expert on me .
i know what the president will say .
what ' s that ?
interesting .
nothing comes .
as i said , he isn ' t italian . besides , i thought they just killed them .
<person> ' t be naive . they can ' t kill everybody . they have different punishments for different things . like , if they kill a stool pidgeon , they leave a canary on the body .
. while she watched the kids . then , you booked this flat in paris for your family ' s summer . but she said .
' . the kids have camp . their friends are here . over there , i ' ll just be shopping in a language i don ' t even know . my life , and the kids ' lives , aren ' t here to service your mid-life crisis . ' did it go like that ? <continued_utterance> she called it a fight . the fight .
<person> , when you meet someone and you ' re attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
i don ' t even know him . but i ' m having all these fantasies about a man i ' ve never met , who lives in seattle .
what ' s up ?
i can ' t take it anymore . i ' ve got to call evelyn .
i told you what i want .
i don ' t know , <person> .
no , i just promised myself i ' d give it a try . i got ta get out there sooner or later .
go for it , man .
go ahead and draw the face of the man you saw . <continued_utterance> we ' ll get an artist to help you .
i can draw him , thank you .

this spacecraft was designed to pick things up . they see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in . they come across this . this . <continued_utterance> our present .
i ' ve never seen anyone killed before .
it ' s okay . i ' ve never been a detective before either . <continued_utterance> we ' ll go slow . <person> ? we ' ll get through it together .
commander suran , the games are over . in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair .
for the moment .
you saved my life .
i ' m a christian .
i can still use a gun .

<person> to know you , miss -- been expectin ' you at santa inez . i ' m <person> . any relation of red <person> ' s a friend of mine .
what ' s going on with him ?
<person> . she has a steady boyfriend .
<person>r , any girl that ' s worth your attention is of course gon na have a boyfriend . but if she really gets to know what you have to offer she ' ll . you get my drift ?
that ' s true . you grow up here ?
central high , ' n ' matinees , the bijou theatre .

what ' re they talking about ?
traffic light .

<person> !
yes . but the enterprise . my duty .
. is to yourself . <person> ' t make me hurt you again . <continued_utterance> and i need to control this ship . let me into your mind .
meanwhile , hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years younger than him .
i don ' t believe it .
why not ? <person> ' t you love <person> ?
of course i love him . i always will . i ' m just not in love with him any more .
tomorrow .
then tomorrow you will have the pages .
you ' re insane .
am i ? or am i making so much sense that you ' re going insane ?
but . the capsule i ' m in .
a manifestation . your way of making sense of it . this is crushing . colter fights back terror .
i graduated !
i always knew you would .
if you don ' t mind , mam , i ' d be mighty pleased if you ' d go out and have some coffee and pie with me .
why ?
`` rise , one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice . ``

thank you .
so you ' re not ready to show me any pages ? i ' m not putting pressure on you , i ' m just asking .
oh no , i ' m gon na chuck -
<person> bloated and all greeny .
well , most of the best freighter pilots can be found here . only watch your step . this place can be a little rough .
i ' m ready for anything .
err .
it ' s because of stories . i am sure you ' ve heard one or two of those stories . for example , did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing , however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing , so the governor saw fit not to kill em . he thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale . that way everybody wins , well , all except the two that died of course .
she thinks you ' re a bucket of dog vomit . trust me on this .
she ' s my destiny .
maybe .
i ' m so tired , <person> . i ' m tired in my body . i ' m tired in my mind . i ' m tired in my heart . i need a little help here . i don ' t know if you noticed -- but our little family isn ' t doing so good . <continued_utterance> i ' m praying for us , but i must not be praying right . it looks like we ' re just going to have to answer each other ' s prayers . if we can ' t talk to each other -- we ' re not going to make it . now baby , tell me . i won ' t be mad , honey . did you take the bumble bee pendant ?
just like we look forward to this . <continued_utterance> you ' re leaving .
i better get back .
only we got closer and it wasn ' t a jacket .
it was a body bag . a homeless person had frozen during the night .
and what does he do again ?
he used to work with you . until you found out he was having an affair with your wife .
you don ' t ? so , you ' re going to take the ten million and walk ?
no .
i ' m not sure i can reach him in time .
sure you can if you want to , and i know you ' ll want to . by the way , what ' s your beef against little <person> ?
if you say so , i will . <person> ' t wait till wednesday . i ' m so excited to see it .
i hope you like it .
they ' re going to release him .
<person> . when will he be free -- ?

it was the best money i ' d ever spent .
pretty girl .
every combat simulator has one . in the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno . <continued_utterance> you ' re an unusual choice for a distraction .

do i press above or below it ?
i don ' t know ! just . both ! <continued_utterance> i can ' t turn it ! it ' s gon na flood !
people throw stones . they call me names . i mean , really .

<person> ' t mince words , <person> ; tell me what you really think .
i ' m your doctor and i ' m your friend , <person> . <person> back your command . <person> it back before you really do grow old . before you turn into part of this collection .
the goods . the sound . the sale . <person> ' s rearrange a few things . <person> , you re not a natural soprano , you ' re an alto . get over here . <person> -- with the sopranos . <continued_utterance> <person> -- a c . <continued_utterance> middle section , hold that note , for dear life . <person> , an a . <person> ?

<person> --

<person> ? you are with him ?
he still needs a ticket . <continued_utterance> have it your way , pal .
<person> . i ' ll pay it .
wow . so this is what you ' re supposed to do on a rainy afternoon . <continued_utterance> i really thought i was sorta closed for business . just never expected this .
this is crazy . i can ' t remember the last time i cried . i think i ' m overwhelmed .
know what your destiny is , crazy boy ? a bullet between the eyes . and after that , he ' ll kill her .
me , i don ' t care . <person> ? she ' s already half dead .
at least he ' s not a cop . at least he can afford a decent gift .
i used to buy . you , . stuff . on your birthday . when we were seeing each other .
why didn ' t the marriage work out ?
did you not hear me say my husband fell in love with my gown ? has your fiance expressed any interest in what you ' ll be wearing ?
would you please hold all calls to my room ?
though i can tell you a few things about his dietary requirements .
and was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did ?
no , she hadn ' t even started to move the bus . it was the car ' s fault .
-- i didn ' t know it would come to this --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone . you know , <person> said something to me earlier . i think he ' s right . he said , `` when you got a guy who -- if he wasn ' t here -- he ' d be standing in the unemployment line , you got ta question if you got the right guy . `` on norman -- sweating .
he asked me to ask you to call him . <continued_utterance> i know ! it ' s none of my business . but i felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you . i swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall -- his heart stopped .
<person> -- it ' s so much more complicated than you can imagine .
you admire it ?
i like it when they cut heads off . and the daughter mutilated with knives .
you think i haven ' t noticed how you ' ve been worming your way in ? you keep your hands off my wife , you low-rent pedant .
you ' ve abused her long enough / with your goddamn lies -
why ?
cause she doesn ' t look at me like everybody and i don ' t want her to .
i don ' t know .
you ' ll owe me .
i ' m not whining ! i ' m not .
i didn ' t say it to hurt you .

the mistake . i love it .
how uncommon ?
one in a half million , maybe , it doesn ' t really have a name . but it isn ' t consequential . <person> ' t have any effect on cognitive processes .
you can ' t play your friends like marks , hooker . <continued_utterance> you know how easy it ' d be for one of lonnegan ' s guys to nail you ?

<person> . that tape is a lightning bolt from god . it ' s worth more than you , more than me , more than <person> . you understand ? it can change things . things that need changing before we all go off the end of the road . and you do not have the right to use it for currency . you go . you go alone . this is where i draw the line . i care about you <person> . a lot more than you know . which makes us both pretty stupid . but you pawn that tape , you mean nothing to me . <person> doesn ' t know what to say . tough choice . he clenches his jaw . <continued_utterance> ah , hell . <person> --

and these blast points , too accurate for <person> . only imperial stormtroopers are so precise .
why would imperial troops want to slaughter <person> ? <continued_utterance> if they traced the robots here , they may have learned who they sold them to . and that would lead them home !
that . that was a different matter , i . i was tricked .
how come ?
no , <person> , you shouldn ' t touch her .
nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . <person> told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her .

it ' s something .
you still don ' t believe in <person> ?
<person> , you ' re gon na make me cry .
and if the o . j . trial taught us anything , it taught us that in america , you can cut off someone ' s head and still be found innocent if you have enough money . your mom only shot a guy . <continued_utterance> now <person> , i know you dream of an all leather apartment with <person> - i heard the school shrink telling a lunch lady . <continued_utterance> and hannah , you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids sally struthers advertises .
meaning ?
in this game , the most committed wins .
eliminate them , you mean .
well , no one ' s out there , but officially these are `` hostile zones . `` therefore you ' d be within your rights to classify anyone as `` hostile , '' i think . but i repeat , you should be worried about boredom , not action . any other questions before i go ?
well . it ' s the thought that counts .
i broke ' em , careful . <person> her an omelette with ' em . and i saved the shells . in a little box . she can ' t help but show her surprise at that . <continued_utterance> oh , yeh . they ' re on a shelf behind my desk . at the paper .
no .

yes i do . tell me .
i felt something with you , i didn ' t know really existed . you know what that ' s like after a twenty year marriage ? to feel something for another person that ' s so off the charts , that - okay , not your problem . this is why i ' m not good in relationships . you know writers are like teachers , those who can - do , those who can ' t - write romantic comedies where this does not happen in the third act . and it certainly does not happen to a <number> year old woman . in the play i ' ll be <number> so it won ' t be as pathetic . i ' m just too old to feel crushed . i ' ve written this feeling but i never really got it . you know what this is ? this is heart broken . how ' s that for impervious ?
and when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ?
what telegram ?
yes !
no i ' m not !
<person> , you ' re talking about three guys over a seven year span . that ' s hardly news . no deaths . elopement in this state , as of this day , is still not illegal .
<person> well murder is . and this article says that these men were murdered by the same woman .
so you drank too much last night . so did i . unfortunately , i remember the whole thing .
that ' s not it . see . i ' m a pilot . i fly helicopters in iraq . i ' m in the army . <continued_utterance> i was on a mission . <person> before i woke up here i was in the middle of a mission .
<person> , son , you lost me on that last hill . just give us the punch line .
no punch line . maybe i was just admiring your know-how -- -yours and <person> ' s .
since when -- <number> ?
i ' ve had other things on my mind .
so what ' s the plan today ?
we head north , begin the grape tour up there , make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel . <continued_utterance> what ' s your problem ? <continued_utterance> what is it ?

yes . i bought the house from her , two years ago .
no . it ' s a good question . a fine question . complicated . i was just thinking to answer .
oh stop . come on . <person> ' t we close ?
i ' m absolutely positive .
no matter what i ' m asked , i ' ll tell the truth .
liz ? she ' s great . but she has a boyfriend .
a boy your age should have a girlfriend .
captain <person> . <person> <person> . i don ' t mean to stare , it ' s just -- well , you can ' t imagine how long i ' ve been waiting for this moment . i always imagined you taller , isn ' t that odd ? you may scan me without subterfuge , commander data .
and you ' re not as we imagined you .
<person> . sometimes i turn the sport page and look at the society news . and the pictures . she ' s very beautiful , <person> ' s daughter .
you ' re quite a reader , mr . <person> .
<person> ' t bother me , norman .
it ' s not worth the risk .
and calculus . you were going over a speech you ' d made .
i was ? i ' m sorry , mr . <person> . i certainly must have celebrated ! i can ' t remember you at all . <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .

a synthetic opium analogue .
does it cause drowsiness ? that ' s all we need . to get him unconscious -- put him under .
<person> , you ' re an ignorant fool .
<person> !
i ' ll help pay for <person> , if that ' s what you ' re really talking about . i ' ll even give you the money i got for my kids . that ' s what we used to do , remember ? help each other . this was a community .
i ' m sorry .
- he was with them !
but-
the t- <number> has the same files that i do . it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at <person> ' s house .
i don ' t care . we ' ve got ta stop her .
you can ' t drive a cadillac on water .
yes ! in the states they make cars that drive on water .
a real skunk .
<person> , you know dough-boy , <person>
what do you think my dad ' s gon na do for you ?
he said he ' d sponsor me .
you are very intense , you know that ?
i remember my <person> telling me not to say anything . and i didn ' t .
maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit . so he ' d have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in ? <continued_utterance> <person> , how many batteries and what size did you find on <continued_utterance> no spare .
no .
a few months tops .
then i ' ll come out and work for you and learn -
he ' s having an early night .
<person> man . we were knocking on that door for ever . i think i ' ve broken my strap .
how ' s the trip ?
good , good . drinking some good wines and kicking back , you know . so what ' s happening ? still no word ?
well , i ' m not coming , <person> . so you guys have fun .
i ' m going to hang up now , <person> .
<person> this guy , <person> , he ' s a press agent .
you watch him , <person> , i s . s . stutter !
you know damn well what . you ' re doing it !
doing what ? i ' m not doing anything -- !
we had a script conference .
i told her thank you very much , but it was inconvenient because , uh , because .
launch patrols .
evacuate remaining ground staff .
<person> at you , you ' re sleeping . <person> how vulnerable you are . i mean , i could do anything at that point .
what could you do ?
do i have to get a shot ?
what ? no . of course not . this is really fucked timing .
and i find - you know - as a professional writer- it ' s best to just , you know , stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed . and in the morning .
you know what to do ?
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners , on the moons of naboo .
i don ' t wish to disagree but i think that <person> was behind it .
what ? me ?
no -- to -- it -- here . i have no real connection to our life here .
<person> . <person> name . there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
no , mr . <person> doesn ' t do that at all .
yeah , hold on .
just call me later . i got ta get some smokes for <person> .
<person> ' s plans .
<person> . i ' m always planning .
<person> bello . <person> ' t you want to fuck every woman you see . just once .
this is <person> . <person> miles . <continued_utterance> i ' ll tell you - i am so cabin-crazy with <person> .
the young boy that died lit himself on fire . it was unfortunate , but how can they blame us ?
<person> ' t believe the hype ! !
if i did the math right .
it ' s the sheriff ' s math . i ' m wondering about .
typical .
here theo , it ' s the fazeli specialty ; a seven-ten split . theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing .
<person> , what are you doing ?
i told you i need a drink .
i can ?
you bet your life . `` the mill wheel goes around . some times it ' s even under water -- then it rises up , as high as it can go . ``
you ' re right . it ' s down there , and i ' m in here . i guess it comes down to a simple choice , really . get busy living or get busy dying .
<person> ?
you don ' t understand , they ' re pros ! from the age of twelve they ' ve been dodging people like you , people better than you .
you mean people like you ?
if you can ' t put this behind you , then we ' re stuck .
well i ' d better sort myself out then .
where ' s the original -- ?
in his passport .
i don ' t eat vegetables .
well , i can offer you something to drink ?
twenty-five by five , roll seven . and don ' t exceed port speed .
or . ?
huh ?
i can get you front and center . what do you like ? i can get you mets , knicks , <person> ? hell , i can get you the mayor ' s box .
seven , eight . so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space , and she asks me what i ' m doing , and i start trying to explain to her , about this state that i can put myself in , and this look comes over her face .
what kind of look ?
my father .
i am deeply honoured to be in your presence , <person> <person> . your father was a true patriot , a man of god .
from <person> ' s viewpoint . <continued_utterance> sure you ' re in jail , <person> . you ' re a prisoner of your own fears , of your own greed and ambition ; you ' re in jail .
from hunsecker ' s viewpoint . <continued_utterance> j . j . if you ' re trying to -
you did ? that ' s funny . so did we .
yes ?
a thousand down . we ' ll sign papers t ' morrow .
<person> hundred . and it ' s a deal .
i don ' t pay much attention to those guys .
in the last hour or so .
i stand down when the girl ' s back , sir .
they ' ll get her out , if she ' s in there . you did your part , what the fuck do you want , a citation ?
how about sunday night ? that ' s always the best time .
<person> .
<person> .
how ' s the arm ?
at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together . in the hollow cedar , everywhere . were a secret . <continued_utterance> i told myself that was good . that it made our friendship special . and didn ' t mean she was ashamed of it .
<person> . <person> is best .
why ?
just . wan na know .
did he have any particular problems that you knew of ? financial pressures . run-ins with the law .
no , nothing like that . <person> ' s wife , lydia , died of cancer a few years ago . he took over raising the children by himself . it was obvious how much he missed lydia .
<person> , maybe it is better if you don ' t come to the wedding .
whatever you say , <person> . you ' re the boss .
hi !
we had a date .
but <person> , you ' re a normal suburban guy at heart , from a normal suburban family . <person> ' t you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family .
yes , but , i ' m afraid , okay ? there are seven main rites of passage in a man ' s life . <person> , first day of school , last day of school . <person> . <person> . retirement . <person> . i ' m at marriage . i ' m two rites of passage away from death .
no problem . take a few weeks .
weeks ?

i look forward to seeing <person> again . i ' ve thought about it every day since i left . it ' s by far the most beautiful place i ' ve ever seen .
you were just a little boy then . it may not be as you remember it ; time changes your perception .
nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . <person> told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her .
what did your dad tell you to do to <person> ? theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees . <person> catches him , grabbing his ankles .
you alright <person> ?
do you know why the governor is the governor ?
you sure you want this , because . that ' s putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over .
i ' m afraid the situation demands that kind of risk .
honestly ? because i ' ve had this very unusual reaction .
yeah .
<person> ' s the place to be if you ' re a terrorist . <person> ' s hovering . <person> , take over . <continued_utterance> . tell her to watch out for reflections .
i got the judge .
for what ?
everything .
<person> livin ' with her . <continued_utterance> i actually saw her naked last night .
that doesn ' t sound so uptight .
that ' s a good one , coming from you .
why don ' t you just split ? you don ' t love him , anybody can see that . and to him you ' re just some kinda possession , like a ferrari , something to show the other guys .
so have you . grown more beautiful , i mean . and much shorter . for a senator , i mean .
oh <person> , you ' ll always be that little boy i knew on tatooine .

uh , i don ' t want to bet it all .
`` though lovers be lost love shall not . and death shall have no dominion . `` <person> wipes the hair from her face .

whatever it is . go do it . how you doing on the permit ?

you ain ' t goin ' nowhere on that leg .
and die laughing , because you ' re walking so stupid !

i ' ll be right up .
that ' d take you years .
years i ' ve got . what i don ' t have are the rocks . pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim .

it ' s the future , isn ' t it ? just like you told <person> . i knew you weren ' t from around here .
i ' m sorry . when i ' m around you , my mind is no longer my own .
it ' s the situation . the stress .

it ' s worth a try . i had something else to tell you . it ' ll come to me .
do you ever perform out here ? i ' d love to see you .
no .
i never did . or the whole idea of an afterlife . but i don ' t know any more . i have these dreams about . your mom . and we have long talks about . about you , and how you are , which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway . so what is that ? it ' s sort of an afterlife , isn ' t it ?
i ' m starting to forget her .

killing <person> might actually prevent the war .
i don ' t care ! ! there ' s got ta be another way . <person> ' t you learned anything ? ! <person> ' t you figured out why you can ' t kill people ? terminator is still stumped . <continued_utterance> look , maybe you don ' t care if you live or die . but everybody ' s not like that ! <person> ? ! we have feelings . we hurt . we ' re afraid . you got ta learn this stuff , man , i ' m not kidding . it ' s important .

oh , great . and what happens to her ?
it ' s like you always said -- if something ' s important enough , you make the time . <continued_utterance> so . that ' s why you ' ve been running around the galaxy like an eighteen-year-old . finding retirement a little lonely , are we ?
with that kind of tact , i ' m glad you ' re an engineer and not a psychiatrist .
what are you doing ?
are you my friend ?
not without a complete myelodysplastic infusion from the only donor with compatible dna . but that would mean draining all your blood .

i felt a little guilty , so i got out some of your old stories .
why , you sweet kid .
because you left , man . she ' s got her own world to deal with in new york . she was a sweet girl but fuck her . you got ta move on . you got ta let go of the past . the future is so beautiful . every day is so sunny out here . it ' s like <person> man . i mean , we made it . what ' s past is prologue . that which does not kill us makes us stronger . all that shit . you ' ll get over it .

and <person> told you that he ' ll tell that to .
mrs . <person> , if <person> <person> does not volunteer to say so in court , i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect . <continued_utterance> but in order to do that , you must let me bring a suit in your name <continued_utterance> charging negligent infliction of emotional harm . that ' s what i ' m now asking you to consider . <continued_utterance> it ' s clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event .
you ' re overlooking one of the great things about me . i don ' t have a type .

i got power ! gim me a minute !
we don ' t have a minute !
you won ' t know him .
are you taking the piss ?
what is it ?
any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up ?

you ' re implying th .
i don ' t believe you .

and what ' s that ?
that you came upon <person> by accident . like you said . gave him the battery . like you said . asked him about the seven acres . like you said . <continued_utterance> only . he said no . <continued_utterance> and something . happened . that you ' d never planned . because you ' re not a cold-blooded killer .

came into the system with a stolen password . an ' we caught him tryin ' to raid a high-clearance memory .
thanks .
what a couple of losers .
hi .
you look good .
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t leave until we figure out a way to document it , to prove its existence to the planet earth . this is hilarious : he thinks it ' s god , but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home .
<person> wants to destroy it .
<person> gives people their heart ' s desire . <person> ' t that right , <person> ?
that ' s right . my second question i got ta ask , so we get our bearings here . have you ever jacket in ?
my husband feels you betrayed him .
do you ?
stop ! stop reading from your goddamn script !
perhaps we overestimated your abilities .
what do you mean ?
these are not the kind of movies i go to .
<person> , and what does <person> say about that ?
i don ' t know . he took it hard .
i overhead what you told <person> . the lie .
i have a snoop .
ike ? ! <person> ' s mother rushes over to general plymkin . <continued_utterance> general . these are our children !
they are canadian sympathizers and they must be dealt with accordingly !
<person> ' t hurt me .
stop acting , for chrissakes .
oh . i needed that . thank you . <continued_utterance> so what are you guys up to tonight ?
we ' re pretty wiped . probably go back to the hotel and crash .
i do not love you , my lord .
how your mind hops about ! your father was a shopkeeper , your children will bear arms , and i will recover my fortune . that is the only matter under discussion today . you will like <person> .
there is . they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses .
<person> ? ! oh , come on <person> . <continued_utterance> you hear that , <person> ? now he ' s telling us .
neither of ' em . they ' re just moms .
well , my lord , whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention .
i assure you , <person> , that after today . no one will ever call you that again .
just do me a favor . bring my ship back in one piece .
oh , the martial arts expert . the north-south guy . here in san francisco ?
actually , miami .
why would imperial troops want to slaughter <person> ? <continued_utterance> if they traced the robots here , they may have learned who they sold them to . and that would lead them home !
<person> , <person> ! it ' s too dangerous .
my ankle . just go explain the situation .
uh , excuse me , sir , but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago , and he seems to have left his wallet behind , and we were wondering .
<person> again ! and get out of here .
i ' m going . my regards to vince , and the mrs . <continued_utterance> ladies .
it happens .
what happens when he loves <person> more than us ?
it ' s too late . you should have paid him when you had the chance . <person> ' s put a price on your head , so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you . i ' m lucky i found you first .
<person> , but this time i got the money .
a phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range .
just what you see , pal .
looks kinda like she ' s formed an attachment . <continued_utterance> for the locality , i mean .
i wanted so much to give ranch life a trial , but fear circumstances are against me , especially in view of the recent indian trouble --
yes , dr . <person> was absolutely clear about this : politics and art must be kept separate .
politics and art must be kept separate . i ' ll remember that . but let me see if you can help me with something i just don ' t understand . i ' d really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him . what ' s his secret ?
i guess they don ' t .
what am i thinking now ?
not lately .
i did . i flew in a jet plans too . <person> ! man , that ' s a thrill ! almost blow the sawdust out of my head . i ' m going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon .
<person> . norma .
no one leaves a star . that makes one a star . <continued_utterance> you ' re not leaving me !
there must be some good people .
<person> ' s hope so . because if cochrane dies . the future may die with him .
i have a new title , maybe .
huh .
hi .
hi . so far so good . so . what should we talk about ? how insecure we were in high school . <person> , the first girl i ever felt up . <person> . what about health ? did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak ?
well , maybe that ' s because they know i ' m going to follow them . behind the bus .
they can look forward to that .
that was never a condition of our agreement , nor was giving <person> to this bounty hunter !
perhaps you think you ' re being treated unfairly .
and what about the guy that was following me ?
now you ' re really getting paranoid .
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level . i can ' t overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation , <person> . a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds .
understood . <person> on it . i need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat . give me options .
and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future . only going through the dark side can we see .
it ' s been ten years , and the sith still have no shown themselves .
yes .
<person> . call me back .
i ' ll give you fifteen minutes grace time .
we ' ll be there . <person> . we love you .
nope . it ' s weird they ' re just in there .
get the frequency of the driver ' s radio and patch it through to this number . we need two lines . <person> , get a negotiator out here .
<person> , take some executive . bored with his life , bored with his wife . he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar . then he goes around for months , torn up worrying that he ' s got aids , that he ' ll infect his wife . and maybe he really does catch something --
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig .
she didn ' t .
but you said .
no . our team cut him loose . he ' s got a cousin there . i don ' t know what he ' s going to do .
shit . what about his family ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
<number> - <number> - <number> . that ' s all . i just wanted to leave my number . i don ' t want you to think i ' m weird , or desperate or something . . i mean , you know , we should just hang out . that ' s it . no expectations . just , you know , hang out . bye . he hangs up . <person> .

not in those words .
big mike ! big mike ! big mike !
<person> , yeah thanks . now , i want go over a few basic things . first of all , make sure you ' ve all filled out your paperwork with personnel , cause nobody gets paid unless they do . come to think of it , i suppose it ' s better for me that you don ' t fill out your paperwork , then i don ' t have to pay you . i ' ll make it optional . if you want to get paid , fill out your paperwork . <person> ' s remember , the people who come here are our guests , and your job is to see they have a safe and fun experience here . <person> ' s work together to keep the park clean and safe , and we ' ll have a great summer together . now with a few words is our head lifeguard , <person> . another cheer starts up , smaller this time , which alex starts .

there ' s about $ <number> here . and a hotline code number . they ' ll patch you through to me , wherever i am .
thank you .
<person> .
i knew we would be together forever , and that everything would be wonderful , just the way you feel about <person> . <person> . it ' s quite a formal name , isn ' t it ? one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time . in the sack i believe you call it --
besides the address book ? he took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer . and my skis . and my tv .
will you press charges ?
when the queen commands it .
but at the playhouse . <person> ?
move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission .
yes , my lord .
what does that mean ?
she smelled exactly like <person> ' s <person> soup . she was dirty , physically dirty .
all i have is my personal feelings . i wasn ' t raised with the ideals of the federation . but i ' m trying to understand them now . to live up to them to live up to you . <continued_utterance> i want to know where i come from . the remans gave me a future . you can tell me about my past .
there ' s so much , and so much of it is dull .
oh . where is this place ?
it ' s one of these . for some reason , cool bars in l . a . have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front .
oh my god . are they gon na take him downtown ?
<person> ! he got arrested ! we ' re on our own .
our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged .
he can ' t go to the ribbon . so he ' s trying to make the ribbon come to him . <person> , is it going to pass near any m-class planets ?
maybe .
every time we have dealings with <person> , i get nervous . we ' re dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon . remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with ? that ' s exactly the --
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about !
i ' m going to do it .
been better .
the agency has come up with another list of probables . <continued_utterance> i think we should circulate them . hey , this stuff may be good .
i don ' t know .
<person> to me , baby , there are going to be beautiful babies there .
try it on . <continued_utterance> <person> has to marry me , soon .
why , you pregnant ? kidding .
but they ' re going to kill her !
better her than me .
<person> , be careful when you talk to octavius . remember . the man is a very fragile genius . one day he ' ll bring us all the noble prize .
<person> , the man is a very dangerous crackpot !
what ?
was it a military crash ?
<person> not to screw him up permanently .
you want to be hypnotized . <person> yes .
you ' re working late .
remember him ?
he ' s not feeling well .
he still needs a ticket . <continued_utterance> have it your way , pal .
wipe your feet ! <continued_utterance> you are not dressed properly .
dressed for what ?
ah , you ' re the next big thing . you ' ll survive it . the employee olympics are only a week away . what happens is we have this big opening ceremony where each team chooses a theme and we ' re judged on our spirit . then different teams compete in contests that test their water world skills . the next morning it all ends with the surf contest . you ready ?
i suppose . i ' ve been working out a strategy to use if <person> has a real good day . it ' s risky .
i don ' t want to hurt anybody . i just want to go home .
all the roads into <person> are blocked . we ' d like to talk to you .
so what ' s the difference ?
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back . <person> , you can ' t do anything to make her want to come back . you can only do things to make her not want to come back .
<person> !
rephrase . do you agree that he might tie up to the defendant ' s bo .
and i have two coffees .
i just got a heads-up from your realtor . the apartment on <person> finally sold . <continued_utterance> you have sixty days before the new owner takes possession and you are out of there .
hey , <person> .
<person> , how are you ?
but you ' re still tormented , you must be , you ' ve killed somebody .
<person> ' t you put the past in a room , in the cellar , and lock the door and just never go in there ? because that ' s what i do .
come here .
ah ! <person> , dad i have a back zit , man it kills .
it ' s never the question that ' s indiscreet , only the answer .
tell you what , you send me an official inter-agency request for cooperation on this and i ' ll give you copies of everything we come up with . <person> , get your ass on out of here before you contaminate my crime scene any more than you already have .
<person> , get over under that table with <person> and <person> and the others . <person> , you better go on down the root cellar with <person> and help with the ones down there .
where ' s my mother ?
nothing .
are they male or female ?
or shall i call my servant ?
i know your face . you ' re <person> desmond . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big .
that ' s all you have to say ?
i ' m not a drama critic . <continued_utterance> well , mr . <person> , are you going to stay with the sinking ship ?
shut down the source code . <person> now . <continued_utterance> fine . i ' ll do it myself .
i wouldn ' t do that .
i know . she bought him a ticket for <person> and put him on the bus . he didn ' t stay on though and they drove off together .
<person> ' t make sense .
sure .
we just did shots of tequila . would you guys like a shot of tequila ?
bedrock ! i can not dig any further in zis direction !
we ' re going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days . dry up into crunchy little pinkies . the boys stare .
oh <person> . oh <person> .
one more step , asshole .
<person> , i ' m supposed to fix up your script . there ' s nothing in the deal about my staying here .
you ' ll like it here .
<person> is italian . always in and out of love .
yes , that ' s good . until he meets
from the moment i met you , all those years ago , a day hasn ' t gone by when i haven ' t thought of you . and now that i ' m close to you again , i ' m in agony . the closer i get to you , the worse it gets . the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry . i feel dizzy . i can ' t breathe . i ' m haunted by the kiss you should never have given me . my heart is beating , hoping that kiss will not become a scar . you are in my very soul , tormenting me . what can i do ? i will do anything you ask . <continued_utterance> if you are suffering as much as i am , tell me .
. i can ' t . we can ' t . it ' s just not possible .
. and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls . the first time i saw the capital , i was very young . i ' d never seen a waterfall before . i though they were so beautiful . i never dreamed one day i ' d live in the palace .
well , tell me , did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl ?
why should i want to get out of here ? this is where i live .
but you ' re the one that wanted to get away . you ' re the one that came into my cab .
it ' s not your fault . <person> , please get off the case .
it is my fault ! i ' m responsible for her !
these are not the kind of movies i go to .
well , i don ' t follow movies too much .
the people you served thought you did a good job . i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office .
<person> rule is not democracy , <person> . it gives the people what they want , not what they need . and , truthfully , i was relieved when my two terms were up . so were my parents . they worried about me during the blockade and couldn ' t wait for it all to be over . actually , i was hoping to have a family by now . my sisters have the most amazing , wonderful kids . but when the <person> asked me to serve as senator , i couldn ' t refuse her .
i see ghosts . <continued_utterance> they tell me stories . things that happened to them . things that happened to people they know .
how often do you see them ?
i don ' t know . this is kinda short notice . i ' m not sure we can get it all done by saturday .
<person> to . <person> ' s ridin ' the mark in from new york on the century .
did you call the state department ?
they told me to call ins .
tell me , <person> . what are you afraid of ?
i ' m afraid you ' ll hurt him .
i knew that .
<person> , i get the feeling that you like discipline . <person> work . <person> <number> .
well , actually , yes . <continued_utterance> can you get me four belgian porterhouses ? do you know what a porterhouse looks like ?
i ' m meat literate .
no time to discuss this in committee .
i am not a committee !
leaving any minute . <continued_utterance> <person> -- seventeen-fifty -- name ?
rocklin . <continued_utterance> mind if i ride alongside the driver ?
<person> .
yes , <person> , what is it ?
oh .
if you had a choice to live in the past or future and you could be anything you wanted , what would you be ?
nothing . <person> , i want to talk to you about . well . <person> said to ask you . <continued_utterance> see , the place where i can connect with <person> is my photography . because she loves video and all . <continued_utterance> she ' s been talking about this little editing machine , it ' s only .
. a ridiculously forgiveness ? for what , exactly ? <continued_utterance> how much time have you got ? let ' s start with this morning . <continued_utterance> i ' m sure that didn ' t upset her .
well , my mother is , sort of . not really .
if she lives within a mile of here , she ' s rich .

but nothing is happening .
yes , but very well .
<person> don ' t have nightmares .

no -- this is wasting time .
it ' s just there ' s so much to do in a single day .
<person> . the most important question is where to eat . i hope <person> made a reservation .
it ' s okay .
and i had to widen a few doors .
i only need about four hours a night .
me too . never slept eight hours in my life .
aye .
<person> torpedo bays , prepare to fire on my command .
<person> ' s in a different category .
we ' re dealing with degenerates here .
we could go down to the bar - no need for you to -
no , he should talk to you alone .
it ' s new -- have you any idea what you ' re saying ?
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications , <person> . as a matter of cosmic history , it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
so how about this ? he tells me i ' ve got to cover for him if his mother calls . he told her he ' s spending the night at my house .
he say that ?
tap water ' s fine .
ok and the wine menu ' s right next to you . yep . there you go-
no , not so much anymore .
<person> . when your mom and dad , uh , passed away . i had this idea . i wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was . <person> , what ever happened to that ?
you will .
all right , kid . but you ' d better be right about this .
tough , tough !
then why is it , please , that another conductor who was actually a member of the party , who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts , has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait ?
stuttering <person> ! stuttering <person> !

<person> , well fuck you , she ' s a priority to me ! <continued_utterance> hey , goddammit ! what ' s your problem ? <continued_utterance> help ! help ! ! i ' m being kidnapped ! get this psycho off of me ! <continued_utterance> let go of me ! ! <continued_utterance> oww ! <person> ' d you do that ?

how many times i got ta ask <person> to fix that ? he said he fixed this place up , so how come the roof leaks every time it rains ?
<person> .
stinky .
the odor was really strong .
where are you going ?
i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz . he gets into his car .
and young people must be protected from themselves at times -- don ' t you agree ? <person> throws him a quick look , which he returns steadily .
exactly .
we want to talk to ya about <person> .
<person> ' t think i know him .
<person> , reese , i know you want to help , but .
pay attention . the <number> series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . <person> , bad breath , everything . <person> hard to spot . i had to wait ' til he moved on you before i could zero him .
no ! it can ' t be !
did you miss me , buttercup ? all right , gang ! i am your new ruler now ! everyone bow down to me ! !
she thought you were money .
i don ' t think so .
i ' m just drawing blanks . i ' m embarrassed . it ' s my own fault i spent my time on math , which i ' m lucky if i don ' t flunk anyway and .
the guy we are looking for is not a ruse .
what do you mean ?
did they give him special care ?
like what ? i ' m not --
you ' re staring at me .
it ' s my gucci belt , turkish .
no <person> , there ' s a gun in your trousers . what is a gun doing in your trousers ?
what happened ?
as happens so frequently here on romulus , a new government came to power . they decided to abandon the plan -- frankly , i think they were afraid i ' d be discovered and it would lead to war . they weren ' t ready for that . <continued_utterance> romulan ale -- i ' m surprised . i can ' t stand it .
come on .
and ?
i pretty much raised her . you know the scene . depressed mother . withdrawn father . my dad was a photographer too .
<person> ?

<person> , i like that ! where you go , i follow .
christina .
my name ' s <person> . how many of these passengers have you drawn ?

oh , i get it ! a little talk with your wife to about the divorce ! i suppose she was the girl next door . held her hand in high school and before you knew it -- hooked ! am i right ?

oh , let <person> wait .
mr . <person> ?

<person> ? it ' s <person> . where are you right now ?
going to work . why ?
your small convent is in danger of closing , <person> . the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation .
but , <person> .
yes . and i ' m afraid this time they ' ll blow the bus .
if they wanted to blow the bus then why haven ' t they blown the bus -- ?
<person> to <person> . !
you little bitch !
yes . she ' s been here the past three months . ever since she came back from miami . i used to visit her occasionally . she didn ' t speak of me ?
she told me about a martial arts guy and there was some discussion about <person> .
yes .
well , do they sell it here ?
<person> ?
victoria ! how the hell are you ?
yes . come on . it ' s past midnight here .
if you truly don ' t know why i say `` no '' let me at last say the reason . at least that will be a relief .
you told me to .
you have to do what i say ? !
she taught you to shoplift ?
mum , she ' s marrying <person> . why would she look at an old git like dad ?
no . <person> ! did i say <person> ! cross-my heart and hope-to-die , stick-a-needle-in my-eye we ' ll never miss a payment ? !
uh , yes . yes you did .
i know our stated policy is not to negotiate with terrorists , but --
<person> , we can ' t release him because we don ' t have him . we never had him . and besides that , he ' s dead .
likely dead and buried south of the border somewhere . south of the american border somewhere . visa records put <person> , using <person> ' s id and <person> at a mexican surf resort . <person> ' last charge was sixteen hundred dollars at a ' no questions asked ' facelift clinic in guadalajara .
have you contacted the clinic ?
here ' s the question . it ' s been on my mind more and more . do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating me ?
what ? why would . why would anyone do something to someone they love for the purpose of messing them up ?
<person> , sweetheart . had a rough day ?
come here , wimp .
no . only an object of equal size .
well , why doesn ' t become a bomb or something to get me ?
i ' m serious . the summer i was nineteen , i was at jones beach , i swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg . there was no way i was gon na make it back . i was goin ' down , i was swallowing water and everything . <person> was a lifeguard . i don ' t know what he was doing out that far , he said he just had a feeling .
oh my god , did you have sex with him like , that night ?
because . there was no way to win .
a no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face . has that never occurred to you ?
stop ! i ' ve done all i can . i ' m sorry i couldn ' t do better , but i have my own problems .
<person> , you ' re a real hero .
i ' ve had a hard on almost all day and it won ' t go away . like i ' m riding on the back seat of a bus with bad shocks and every other passenger is a gorgeous woman with a yellow sports top whose leaning over . it ' s like every dream i ever had and some even i didn ' t have the balls to dream .
so you ' re considering taking it ? . <person> , here ' s the thing . i can ' t lose you and still keep the hours i ' m keeping . i can ' t do my life unless i can hold onto you . i think i just gave you an incredible bargaining position .
i built a chinese junk . sailed it up from brazil . <person> by a mile or so , got stranded here when i shipwrecked by <person> . <continued_utterance> <person> finished my repairs . be leaving soon . as paleontologists define the term . <continued_utterance> she ' s ugly . and the only thing i ' ve ever loved .
yer story tugs at me bladder .
that ' s where i come in . i channel it , funnel it , filter it . stocks , securities , tax free municipals . i send that money out into the big world . and when it comes back .
it ' s clean as a virgin ' s whistle ?
i am so sorry . i -- uh . i ' d . i uh , can ' t tell . this is so uncomfortable .
you could have just said you didn ' t remember .
if i do , you have to get away , disappear without a trace . different country , different name , everything . in case they send another one .
it ' ll never be over , will it ? look at me , i ' m shaking . some legend , huh ? you must be pretty disappointed .
<person> ale should be illegal .
it is , old chum .
i ' m going to need an operation . maybe a couple of them . they have to wait for it it to heal first . then they break it again .
<person> thing you have a voice-over career .
patterns , repetition of behavior .
now imagine a killer with no patterns , no tell-tale fetishes , no rituals , no hidden desire to be caught . a perfect vessel of evil , killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake . he ' d be immune to capture , wouldn ' t he ? your task forces , your forensics teams - they ' d be helpless .
the star ' s destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector . however , none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon .
give me a list of those effects . i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed . no matter how insignificant .
good one , <person> ! <continued_utterance> <person> !
should i shoot him ? ! ?
<person> , stay .
i can ' t really .
i don ' t remember the exact date .
and when did you last see <person> ?
<person> ?
come .
you can write anywhere .
but this is proper . not just stuff for the paper . ' it ' s about my teens - and is working for me here .
wan na sleep at my house , man ? you ' re my best friend !
yeah ! sleepover ! <person> . you got pizza bagels still ?
you were supposed to go downstairs , baby .
i know . i don ' t always do exactly what i ' m told . so i said , ' do you enjoy watching me ? ' and you said -- come on <person> .
<person> . i ' m on my way home and i don ' t want anybody i ' m with shot at when you .
<person> on .
what ' s that like ?
well , you know , it ' s tough . a lot of traveling . a lot of hotels . but , you know , it ' s a dream . and the money ' s really good . i think i might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in vegas .
no . <person> ' t tell me that .
i ' m sorry .
you can ' t see here . she ' s making a statement .
where is she ?
come on . <person> ' s just do it . we ' re getting married soon .
not so soon .
i told you i didn ' t want to see her ! <continued_utterance> that ' s .
<person> .
come on , <person> . come on , buddy . <person> . <continued_utterance> alright . we ' re going up .
and do what ? take on his whole posse ?
why is <person> after <person> ? why isn ' t he in mexico getting a new face ?
<person> saw him . <person> caught him in the act , caught him being martin <person> . <person> first by his mother , then by <person> . for the first time he ' s failed at taking a life , and since we found the apartment , he can ' t be <person> . to be seen , to be recognized , is a horrifying thing to <person> . he has no identity and wants it that way .
ssh ! you ' ll wake up that monkey .
get out !
you ' re saying , don ' t make the kids a football , don ' t put them through a war . but i ' m doing this for their well-being .
partly . but partly , you ' re mad . <continued_utterance> you know the kids aren ' t really in danger . this is about <person> , and you ' re right , i ' m disappointed in her learning curve , and .
you go naked . something about the field generated by a living organism . nothing dead will go .
why ?
<person> !
just press the button all the way down when you ' re ready , okay ?
next <person> , we ' ll sail into <person> in my cadillac car-boat . <person> ?
you are crazy !
no . i just said <person> was a better name than <person> .
oh . well , my name ' s <person> . i work at <person> ' s .
i am thinking , insect . i ' m thinking about exterminating you !
<person> , if that ' s the way you want it . <person> ' s see what those chrome knuckles can do , <person> .
we have to talk .
<person> luck . you can ' t even think in here . he leads them toward the back of the arcade . <continued_utterance> come on .

frances ?
<person> . not to dash your hopes , but i don ' t deal this kind of product , you know that . i ' ll give you four for it , cause i ' ve got ta cut off the last bit . and my customers want uncut .

we need to talk , just you and i .
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow . just the two of us . or just the one of us .

<person> . a scared little pussy-
hello , mom ?
theodore ? where are you ? are you alright ?
it ' s just as if i ' ve seen a ghost today .
but that wasn ' t your fault , dear , what happened to leslie . i ' ve told you that a million times . he goes to her gently ; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding , frightened eyes .
take a good look around , my friend , and tell me that ' s still true . but we ' re not shutting you out . in fact , i can ' t do it without you , <person> . i need men like you . men willing to put it on the line like you did in that schoolroom . these stars mean i have been putting it on the line for thirty years . and never made a mistake worth remembering . <person> ' t tell me i made a mistake about you .
they ' re not shutting us out . they need men like me .

<person> . how did you like it ?
i didn ' t .
that ' s cos she does it in five star resorts around the world - and not the feathers carpark . <continued_utterance> it ' s <person> !
`who ' s the daddy ? <person> and <person> recently announced they were expecting . but in a valentine tryst shocker <person> is snapped with ex <person> sergeant ! <person> and <person> - we say <person> . '

the bottom line is you ' re a bailer . you just bailed on me , you bailed on me this morning when <person> spat on me , and you ' re bailing on me next year !
so i mailed your letter .
`` dear <person> : thanks for your letter . it was great . we ' re very excited about meeting you in new york on <person> ' s day and seeing if we are m . f . e . o .

and you know what happens when people assume . they make an ass out of who ?
you and me .
you ' re too goddamned paranoid .
<person> ' s only reality on a finer scale .
i slept til one-thirty , when my wife woke me up with the news . we talked for a few hours . i left at six and went straight to my boat .
<person> ' t go anywhere else ? no errands , no purchases ? just straight to the boat . that ' s the truth .
mr . <person> .

i ' ll dig a hole and hide in it .

no , it ' s pretty but it ' s so -- simple .
that ! now stop it ! <continued_utterance> <person> ! !
i ' m not really supposed to do that . for fun , i mean . if <person> obi-wan were here , he ' d be very grumpy .

i used to lie awake thinking about you being here . in ewedown , the bumhole of nowhere . it was the best thing to happen ever . i ' ve been so in love with you . and when you left i couldn ' t bear it . i thought the valentine would make you come back .
twenty-eight years .

<person> , act crazy ?
curse and stuff .
<person> ! everybody ! <person> <number> . <continued_utterance> <person> ?

what right do you have to take me for granted ?
what right ? do you want me to tell you ?
how can i thank you ? how can i repay you for this part ? it ' s a . what a , thank you for this part . the first scene at the old mill .
<person> ' s been having some thoughts about the old mill scene , <person> .
our position is correct , except . no , <person> !
what do you mean ? where is it ?
so i hear .
<person> , we ain ' t that much fussy anyway . there ' s always opening on one fleet or another . <person> out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk , and leave your phone number . you got ta phone ?
you gone too far !
i ' m getting him down here .
<person> . definitely .
so what ' s your novel about ?
she can ' t because of her daughter .
you have a daughter ? you have a whole daughter you haven ' t mentioned . how old ?
<person> -- that ' s a foreman ' s wages .
i wouldn ' t offer you a red cent . but it ' s his money . and the way things are shaping , maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch .
what programs were accessed ?
that ' s what i don ' t get -- it ' s mostly basic stellar cartography : star charts ; communications protocols ; some uplinks from colony tracking stations . it ' s not even restricted material .
you ' ll do no such thing <person> .
<person> , we shan ' t , we ' ll settle it some other way , now don ' t get upset .
sir , <person> is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories .
i met your father once when i was just a boy , he was a great pilot . you ' ll do all right . if you ' ve got half of your father ' s skill , you ' ll do better than all right .
i t ' s not a fuckin tin of baked beans , what do you mean open him up ?
i mean open him up .
you ' re welcome . may i join you ?
yeah . sure . this is very nice of you .
the other side . turn it over .
a man- it doesn ' t say his name . he is sort of bald , but has long hair on the sides .
as in canned . <continued_utterance> yer not the only one . eventually .
should i finish the sawmill piece ?
interviews . witnesses . <person> pretty silly , our talking over one another .
<person> . i ' ll handle them from now on .
you don ' t think of it like that . i wish you ' d come visit .
but we ' d visit you and sit in your gorgeous house planning trips into the townships demanding to see the poorest of the poor . `` are you sure they ' re the worst off ? i mean , we ' ve come all this way . we don ' t want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid . we demand shock . `` it doesn ' t seem right sitting on the east side talking about revolution .
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her .
right .
<person> , you ' re all a bunch of ass ramming unclefuckers .
<person> ! ! !
my what ?
your cell . your room .
<person> ' you always have to dress like a fuckin ' pimp ?

oh , yeah . <person> well . still do .
it ' s temporary .
it ' s good . you ' re not pulling a mid-life crisis on us , are you ?
tell me .
you were never second . ever . <continued_utterance> you sleep now , <person> . everything will be different in the morning .
looks like we ' re in a dead heat after one hole . this is turning into quite a rivalry .
you better replace the pin , chi-chi . the natives look restless .
did you get the money ?
of course .
we .
we are over .
oh , yeah , so bad .
why do you want to be my friend ?
the girl ?
the secret service agent , was he fucking <person> . ?
help me with two minutes of silence ! <continued_utterance> go home , <person> . it ' s late .
i hate to see you like this --
then who do they fight ?
other soldiers ! there ' s a saying , `` soldiers deserve soldiers . ``
it ' s in a green <person> ?
yes . it ' s kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere .
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me .
her suit ' s gone .
ah .
ah .
ever wonder why the dalmatian ' s the symbol of the firehouse ?
first organized fire department was on the border of dalmatia and sardinia in the year <number> .
where ' s <person> ?
no idea , sir .
<person> . because of it . <continued_utterance> see , love . <person> ' t about what ' s good for you . <person> ' t about what you wish it was . <person> ' t about what . would make you happy . <continued_utterance> love . is about want . what you really want . and you can ' t change that . even if it ' s poison . <continued_utterance> so that ' s why it ' s great . to have a real friend . when you ' re . lonely .
i know you have to stay tomorrow . to sign the papers . but . <continued_utterance> i should be heading back . <person> . misses me . too much . <continued_utterance> and i ' m not feeling so well . what i get for mixing vodka and beer , huh . <continued_utterance> so i ' ll grab a taxi . you stay and finish . <person> to the music . is <continued_utterance> that all right ?
she was hot .
she really didn ' t do it for me , baby .
<person> is getting desperate . where is she , <person> ? where ' d you stash her ?
where ' s who ?
<person> !
assemble the weapon , load , fire on the target from various evasive positions in a thirty-second period . <continued_utterance> starting . now ! <continued_utterance> as you were , soldier .
you were what ?
i was bitten by a bug .
irrelevant ? killing me each time is irrelevant ?
you do not die . as you can see , you simply return to us .
<person> , it worked out really well .
that ' s great . so i guess that means marriage now , huh ?
well , this is actually , like , a big favor , but , well , my parents gave me like a hundred bucks to feed myself for the week , but the house if full of food , so i figure i should just spend all of it on extra drinks for the party .
wow . i would never even think of doing something that nice .
why ?
my husband feels you betrayed him .
it ' s no use . she just isn ' t here .
it doesn ' t make any sense . she was right behind me .
<person> ' t look that way - you know - from a distance .
i lied . to her . she thought she ' d seen you .
. which one . ?
. the red piece of shit over there .
anything out of the ordinary ?
please take a seat , sir .
no !
<person> away the years of grime and soot and paint ovens . q-tips and water changing the history of western art . <person> colors .
no . not like you and <person> used to be .
how did you know about that ?
i ' m not sure i can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class . in this case math . and the system kind of insists on the illusion that you ' ve learned math -- so they make you go to summer school . it helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission .
what do you mean they failed ?
how -- and i say this with love -- how could you not realize it ?
i ' ve been avoiding mirrors .
yeah , show me , i want to see you do it . pretend i ' m <person> . you ' re the maestro , and you have the baton in your right hand , but you give me the salute just the same .
not here , <person> , there are people , if anybody should see . please , please , <person> .
what ? i can ' t hear you babe .
i want to start getting stuff ready for next week - where ' s the grey suitcase ?
not while i ' m still a virgin .
why didn ' t you ever tell me that before ? <continued_utterance> st . elmo ' s fire - rev . <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
<person> ? what does that mean ?
the truck . the truck has severed most of her lower half .
i know your face . you ' re <person> desmond . you used to be in pictures . you used to be big .
i am big . it ' s the pictures that got small .
<person> . my user has information that could -- could make this a free system again .
hah .
<person> and . impervious .
so you think i ' m inhuman .
that ' s where it gets a little strange .
and what about the guy that was following me ?
well , he ' d read about me in the paper . he knew about <person> -- and about you . he suggested that if he got rid of <person> for me , i should kill his father .
you must have realized he was talking a lot of nonsense !
we ' ve only got honey .
i ' ll . take it straight .
i did do that , didn ' t i ?
how do you feel about snakes ?
i am . really . it was awesome .
i ' m so happy , <person> .

<person> ?
okay , where ' s <person> ?
well then . only one way to go .
do you think this is a wise course of action ?
i already told him that one .
<person> . what about quiet time ?
<person> ?
<person> ? <continued_utterance> come on , <person> ! there ' s no place to go !
you got her ? <continued_utterance> get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . <person> ?
i ' m trying . there .
oh . you know .
did you , um , did you get that pilot ?
surely they can ' t make the movie of cats .
of course they can .
no dogs , no way and that ' s final .
you loser . i hate you . you want to
to refresh your memory , as i told you last time , it was the libyans who --
i remember perfectly well what you said last time . do we ?
i was ordered to by the captain .
<person> ' s try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter , shall we ? you have information , and i need it . did the captain explain his orders to you ? did he say why you were searching for trilithium ?
<person> ' t worry . now that the council has ordered an investigation , it won ' t take <person>aster obi-wan long to find that bounty hunter .
i haven ' t worked for a year to defeat the `` <person>ilitary creation act '' not to be here when its fate is decided .
i want you . to tell the truth .
you think that
the blue .
<person> call .
but then he had to cover up , make her seem just like all the rest of them . that ' s what <person> was hinting !

why would you think her bedroom was the kitchen ?
<person> . i know we ' re not married but - - if you were going to have sex with someone else .
are you waiting for me to get out my datebook ?
late one night . about three . at the plaza .
three in the morning ? i don ' t think so . i have to go to bed early . i work days . it must have been somebody else .
maybe i could bowl in japan .
i got ta wash up .
a dozen or more , all figure eights .
and look at that streak of rust , across the mast .
. and ?
turns out i get this part . they ' re selling some dish soap or something , and they think it will be magical to have two twelve year old kids dancing ballroom on this fantasy set with clouds and everything . they lock this girl and i into a dance studio with a choreographer for two weeks , and then they shoot the commercial .

i ' m so pleased i was wonderful .
keep it . <person> at the time .
you could take bets at the fight .
put a lead on her turkish , before she gets bitten . <continued_utterance> make sure your man goes down in the fourth . you ' re on thin fuckin ice my pedigree chums and i ' ll be there if it breaks .
of course ! ! ice cream ! !
now go , your friends are in danger . the uso show is a mile east of here , just over that ridge . the clitoris has spoken .
<person> from our corner .
i think you better go to the doctor and get some shots .
you have mutual friends .
if you ' re referring to <person> .
hi !
her tits ! her tits ! how , that she signed in her contract , we hired her ' cause of ten years at the actors studio ? the way she played <person> ? her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first wife .
i love you .

i believe you . his gun was layin ' over there on the floor when i come in and --
no it wasn ' t -- it was right in my hand -- like it is now .
four years and a hundred miles away in stratford . a cold bed too , since the twins were born . <person> was a blessing .
so now you are free to love
he didn ' t have to tell .

but i have never seen this before . i am not complete .
the wave . i love that water . <continued_utterance> can ' t swim . it ' s only three inches deep .
ah ha ! <person> ' s go . <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>
what ' s so important ? what ' s he carrying ?
the technical readouts of that battle station . i only hope that when the data is analyzed , a weakness can be found . it ' s not over yet !
cos she loves <continued_utterance> there ' s going to come a moment . when she ' ll really need you to give that back . and you ' re just the girl that can do it .
now do i know when ?
<person> mate .

i have given them more <continued_utterance> ironic , huh ? <continued_utterance> ironic , that i ' m gon na need you . <continued_utterance> to be a little less . undeserving . <continued_utterance> drink your tea while i go vomit . <continued_utterance> you love my kids , that ' s a start . we ' ll work on it .
this is very good tea !
it ' s not me , <person> ' <person> . i worry about you . what if they realise i ' m not you ?
then my jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is .
that ' s a start . so , it could be <person> , <person> or <person> .
i ' ll use a life-line . fifty- fifty .
o . k . where ' s the cash ?
where ' s the story ? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own . it ' s really just a springboard .
good . this is good . sort of thing you ' d never find in a procedural manual . it tells me i was right about you .
i will kill you , <person> ' <person> .
that ' s great , that ' s brilliant .
i feel like a man who ' s just passed a gargantuan stool .
we found him , mrs . <person> . tangled in his net .
i told him this could happen .
no , he ' s not going to try anything . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong with him now ?
oh my . sir , he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast .
what ' s your real name ?
i don ' t like my real name .
<person> , don ' t .
thirty-something , single white female . best schools best grades . discovers adrenaline policing the inner city .
i don ' t know . but it does not feel good . i think if she goes there it will be one of two things . either she will be odd . or she will make herself the same as them .
that is exactly the way i felt about bernice going there . exactly .
no light-speed ?
it ' s not my fault .
nothing bad can happen in a church , right ?
right .
rachel and loren walk off to the dance floor
<person> ?
now you are playing with me , <person> .
no . i swear .
i was just in the cafeteria , there ' s plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .
but why would she -- ?
you ' re staring at me .
no i ' m not . i ' m not star --
you must be so pleased , i followed your jellybean trail right here , like a good little chump .
you got froggy on me a couple times . <continued_utterance> i thought that riff about the death squad was pretty good . i hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it .
so we can reminisce about how i smashed your nose ?
you didn ' t smash it .
fifty pounds !
fifty pounds ! a very worthy sum on a very worthy question . can a play show us the very truth and nature of love ? i bear witness to the wager , and will be the judge of it as occasion arises . i have not seen anything to settle it yet . so -- the fireworks will be soothing after the excitements of <person> ' s audience . have her then , but you are a lordly fool . she has been plucked since i saw her last , and not by you . it takes a woman to know it .
if you went down on a horse . you ' d tell me , right ?
sure , hon . <person> .
yeah .
god , <person> , it ' s all so fucked .
<person> , captain ! tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people . federation and romulan . <person> and vulcan and <person> and <person> . i ' m speaking of the thing that makes us the same . we want peace . <continued_utterance> i want to end the centuries of mistrust . i want to be your ally , not your enemy . as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas .
and the senate supports you ?
i ' ve got everything i ever wanted . i ' m so happy -- i ' m terrified . no one gets everything they want . <person> at you . <person> at miranda . you ' re such good people and look what happened to you . of course , something bad is going to happen to me .
<person> , you shit your pants this year . maybe you ' re done . <continued_utterance> you run every day -- that ' s what you do . you can ' t stop being who you are -- just because you ' re afraid . right ? <continued_utterance> now let ' s get down to business . i ' ve got to have my apartment done in time for that baby shower .
<person> , i never ever met anybody like you before .
i can believe that .
there ' s the rub .
<person> , man . <person> we always talk about the same thing all the time .
who does ? <continued_utterance> you don ' t look like you feel well .
i ' m going through some things .
you still haven ' t said , right ?
is this your way of .
<person> , sure .
o . k . , you guys in line take your time , and i wanta see lotsa joy on wrecking crew .

the parker data . get me the parker data , you hear ? ! ! !
<person> . <person> where ? and live on what ? what can you provide ? what have you got , <person> ?
<person> .

but nothing is happening .
you mean -- you have to do something . <continued_utterance> -- this was all your idea , remember .
my idea -- that ' s all you know about it .
you should come and hear me .
<person> . i will .
it might be in the kitchen .
i ' m only going to be away one night , okay , and <person> will be here . you ' ll have a swell time . you ' ll watch a little geraldo , some nightmare on elm street <number> , i ' ll never know .
it is for me , sister ! <person> , i ain ' t in this for your revolution , and i ' m not in it for you , princess . i expect to be well paid . i ' m in it for the money !
you needn ' t worry about your reward . if money is all that you love , then that ' s what you ' ll receive ! <continued_utterance> your friend is quite a mercenary . i wonder if he really cares about anything . or anyone .
<person> .
nice .
so long .
oh , you --
do you have music up there ?
yes .
why do we stop here ?
if you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs .
i did .
get me a radio . at least i won ' t have to look at his face .
will you be spending more than a night ?
<person> to say . i might have . some business here .
so why do you stay ?
i ' m a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i ' m trapped in his easy payment plan .
<person> ?
<person> .
was he drinking ? could you tell ?
<person>ny , it ' s time for you to go to bed .
four five nights ago . that ' s how i know the romance is off . also <person> ' s in a very bad mood .
<person> , <person> , you ' d better make sure you ' re telling me the truth .
i don ' t think do . it ' s not sleep ; it ' s something else . it ' s all around me .
those are dreams .
anything urgent ?
no .
dolores , people have to know that you ' ve suffered too . <continued_utterance> and they won ' t understand until you let me clear your name - your good name - once and for all . will you let me do that ? will you let me do my duty ?
you heard what <person> said ?
this is the last time i expect to see you down here .
never heard of the place .
-- you ' ve observed him giving cash to --
. no , but --
no . i die .
but <person> , you ' re a normal suburban guy at heart , from a normal suburban family . <person> ' t you tell me you always wanted to get married and have a family .
oh , <person> can make an exception .
<person> ' t take that risk , <person> . <person> . <continued_utterance> safety catch .
you ' re fantastic , <person> . i love you .
it ' s a slant . hey . i know there ' s a lot you went through but i knew all along that <person> was right about you coming back . i mean totally knew it so i wasn ' t that worried . but still i . i really appreciate it , dad . thanks . stop staring at me . what ?
no . <continued_utterance> i , uh . don ' t think you should either .
then excuse me , because if i had the equipment i ' d inject the vodka .
i ' m <person> for <number> years , starling . i won ' t disobey orders , not even now .
but i just became a private citizen . i can go anywhere i want to .
you made her a star ?
i directed all her early pictures . there were three young directors who showed promise in those days : d . w . <person> , c . b . demille , and <person> von mayerling .
oh , yeah . <person> . she ' s not mine no more . i sold her .
sold her .
you will ? you too ? <continued_utterance> help me with these drums , i need to get them to my laboratory immediately .
do as he says .
<person> , the male camel toe look is really big this year .
these pants suck . <person> ' s the get the fuck out of here .
are you still in touch ?
not really . the last time i saw her was at that clinic . that was a long time ago .
then do that , starling . do just exactly that .
<person> , what is it ? there ' s something you ' re not telling me .
what ?
is this crazy ?
<person> what a fraud he was . <continued_utterance> no , but i do like to think about the life of wine , how it ' s a living thing . i like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing , how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained . what the weather was like . i think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes , and if it ' s an old wine , how many of them must be dead by now . i love how wine continues to evolve , how every time i open a bottle it ' s going to taste different than if i had opened it on any other day . because a bottle of wine is actually alive -- it ' s constantly evolving and gaining complexity . that is , until it peaks -- like your ' <number> -- and begins its steady , inevitable decline . and it tastes so fucking good .
<person> over there ?
that ' s one job , you told me a lot of jobs .
a few places - that ' s a few jobs . <person> , i don ' t want to think about new york .
never mind , it ' s gone now . i got ta go .

-- there ' s got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft ? there ' s no such thing . our space program isn ' t even forty years old .
you want me to be sad that someone ' s taking me out to dinner ?
i want you to be sad that we had something really special and it ' s going away !
there is that .
<person> . i ' m trying to believe you .
i caught one , back there .
caught one ? you mean you got shot ?
does this mean what i think it means ?
it ' s over , sir , the storm has cleared .
i killed men who looked just like you , pig-fed german bastards . and their blood don ' t wash off so easy . <continued_utterance> so don ' t talk to me about japs , you big nazi son of a bitch .
i am a bastard . i ' m a big <person> son of a bitch . and i still got your bamboo fishing rod .
. and even then .
. you might get cut out .
there sure is .
you can stay here .
<person> , i hope i don ' t have to remind you --
i appreciate your concern , <person> , but i ' ve been itching to try out the argo .
<person> . options ?
destroy the deflector dish .
sure . that would be fine .
<person> ? i was hoping .
i wouldn ' t go that far .
seriously , they ' re really good , miss . ?
it ' s a good school ?
tops . it ' s tops .
me ? never . never . <continued_utterance> i . i know everyone now says they were never <person> but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true . i am a catholic , it would have been totally against my conscience . <person> . <continued_utterance> is it true you ' re going to interview dr . <person> today ?
i ' ll ask the questions , helmuth .
i never played for winos .

<person> ? the door ? how can it be chipped ?
i don ' t know how it can be chipped , but it ' s chipped .

but all those people dying .
those are not your orders . you are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission .
i never went in that sphere .
you don ' t remember you did . but i ' m sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get <person> , don ' t you ? you remember that .
yes ! that ' s it . yes . you seem a bit older than i remember .
that dream was quite a while ago .
we need something that cuts through metal .
or an experienced thief .

they need you ? a bunch of nuns ? for what ? moral guidance ? make-up tips ?
you don ' t get it ! it ' s a big thing for them , it ' s like . <person> ' s palace . prime-time . they ' re singing for the cardinals . it ' s like . `` <person> . `` if first prize was a trip to the vatican . they ' ve worked really hard , they deserve this .
<person> , this is amazing . if you play this backwards , it says `` <person> is dead . ``
i know .
i ' ve read it twice , norman . it ' s brilliant .
it ' s bullshit . the report ' s a joke .

come with me . the team ' s already waiting .
what team ?
believe me , i ' m very accurate with one of these things .
<person> .
<person> , th ' <person> rossen , i ' m here in .
wat .
does <person> know this ?
no . i ' m doing it behind her back .
no . i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
you mean for you . a <number> -year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it ' s best for her if every- one pretends it didn ' t happen ? this isn ' t going to work out .
we should have gone a long time ago .
oh , god . <person> brother ' s in love .
but why ? he didn ' t weight the others . clarice moves , on fire , unable to keep still . <continued_utterance> the first , what the hell did <person> say about . `` first principles , '' he said . simplicity . what does this guy do , he `` covets . `` how do we first start to covet ? `` we covet what we see - '' <continued_utterance> `` - every day . ``
hot damn , clarice .
what ' s your reaction ?
honestly ? because i ' ve had this very unusual reaction .
it ' s a woman ' s privilege to change her mind . now i can shop for some pretty clothes . i wouldn ' t want you to be ashamed of me in washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties .
and what do you mean by that ?
be my guest .
<person> .
you said that ?
well , i said , <person> , please , we ' re on a bridge .
you and me .
what do you think , kid ?
mmm .
<person> ' ' em over , home-cooked meal , if you ' d . <continued_utterance> well , i ' d be awfully .
<person> , younger ?

even if it was <person> <person> was talkin ' about -- it don ' t follow that he killed him .
no -- general opinion is that it was rustlers .
he can ' t know we ' re talking .
then don ' t tell him .
his last wish was to be buried on earth . in dirt , he said . `` i want to buried in dirt . `` what a clown .
they shouldn ' t let people like you into space .
so , he bought it -- and you ' re going to live there with him ?
yes , together . that ' s right .

i just heard . erm . i wasn ' t being nosey , i just heard <person> .
we can still see each other . just like always . it ' s a different kind of sin . <person> .
you pig !
cock-sucker ?
yeah , we say cocksucker .
if it wasn ' t new year ' s eve , i ' d arrest you for possession of illegal equipment --
just look at the tape ! you want to know who killed <person> ? go in the stall right now and hit <person> .
<person> doakey .
<person> . please . tell me what i did wrong .
oh , but it does . we will no longer bow like slaves before anyone . not the romulans and not your mighty federation . we ' re a race bred for war . for conquest .
think about what you ' re doing , <person> . are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons ?
it ' s not <person> . it ' s that truck and you .
and last night .
we ' re enjoyin ' the walk , thank you .
well . my aunt can ' t bring <person> to the daycare , she ' s got her shop now . but i worked it out with my boss . so i ' ll be bringin ' her come next week . <continued_utterance> no reaction . <continued_utterance> if that ' s all right .

how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark .
it was <person> ' s ninth .
do you really think it was brave ? <person> ' t he bow to him and shake his hand ?
i just got kicked off my first movie .
well . everybody has reversals . if you were never down how would you know when you were up ?
long enough to call victoria a ho .
it ' s a short word .
is it being deliberately cruel , you mean ? i don ' t think so .
i ' m just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances .
a weapon .
it would appear so . <continued_utterance> <person> equipped me with the prototype for the emergency transport unit . i recommend you use it to return to the enterprise .
what does <person> already know ?
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t be going down . thinks it ' s a mistake . <continued_utterance> she told me what you said , <person> .

i ' m never going to meet anyone who ' s going to measure up to your mom in your eyes ? what do you think ? there ' s a perfect woman walking around out there ? <continued_utterance> there ' s no such thing as a perf -- <continued_utterance> god , she ' s beautiful .
<person> ? she ' s okay . <continued_utterance> dad , i was talking to <person> about reincarnation , and she thinks that probably you knew <person> in another life .

<person> , are you just going to sit here and let him die ? ? he ' s your friend . your mentor .
<person> hunting . <person> out .
<person> , set a pursuit course .
what are you talking about ?
i made some friends at the academy . . when our frigate goes to one of the central systems , we ' re going to jump ship and join the alliance .

he records himself raping and killing her --
but at the same time he ' s sending the signal to her --
sunday . we should leave as soon as we can .
we ? she stiffens . tom
what ' s that ?
causes sleep .
well , just to put it back in our minds , could you repeat what you told us . about the <continued_utterance> <person> you inferred was replaced by the d- <number> , which must have been a spare .
what else could it be ?
i know . my mother doesn ' t know how to do things that aren ' t perfect .
which explains you .
they ' re from my old convent . <continued_utterance> run ! take off !
<person> ?
no . <person> .
what ? why ?
i think television ' s a dangerous thing .
it ' s twenty bucks in the bank . <continued_utterance> enough , <person> ! c ' mon . get out of there !
<person> work . the download ?
he believes he has our communications protocols . but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels . <continued_utterance> <person> , puny human animal .
stay ready . stay by yourself in your room .
what ' ll i do for fun ?
<person> ' t tell me he ' s `` busy '' . i asked for an ambulance for this woman and .
is she injured ?
mr . <person> , did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs . <person> ?
no . <person> . was she a great , fat person ? i may have seen her , i ' m not sure .
oh my ! oh my . maybe you better come out now , <person> .
not yet ! - just wait for me . maybe in about two seconds .
all of this so you could capture me ?
<person> ' t be so vain . after we found it , we made a few modifications . an extra memory port , a hidden transponder . perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn i ' ve gained access to <person> ' s communications protocols . i now know the location of your entire fleet . . you may go .
i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .
i don ' t think i have to now . <continued_utterance> look , it ' s almost christmas -- a kid needs a mother -- he puts an arm around <person> .
we ' re alive .
<person> ' t pick it up !
of course it is .
maybe it ' s a little long and maybe there are some repetitions . but you ' re not a professional writer .
a face ! i saw -- it was like a child -- he points . the porthole is empty .
you ' re crazy -- !
what ?
i know where <person> is .
the white dog . sometimes with the skinny ghost . kids do things like that , it ' s called imagination . like the necklaces .
you know how many she makes ?
first -- move us within transporter range and beam those people to the enterprise .
what about the gravimetric distortions ? they ' ll tear us apart .
please understand . if you go this way , you ' ll never get to your ship . the police know about <person> . we have to go another way . i ' ll get you to your ship . i promise .
i will go . but not you .
trust me , i ' m very good at this . <person> again . <continued_utterance> wasn ' t that fun ?
you might have oversold it .
right down to the kleenex i used . <person> , why ? is something wrong ?
he mentioned a name , at the very end . `` <person> . `` any followup on her ?
i ' m in charge . <continued_utterance> with an `` o '' . <person> with an `` o '' .
what -- you want me to retype it ? <person> : `` who are you ? '' `` i am one '' `` where are you from ? '' `` i am here '' `` where is the location from where you began ? ''
but not no more . now people take advantage . <person> ain ' t what it used to be . there ' s something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
- canker sore .
does it have wheat in it ?
i don ' t think so .
not if they feel threatened . the separatists don ' t have an army , but if they are provoked , they will move to defend themselves . i ' m sure of that . and with no time or money to build an army , my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help .
the armies of commerce ! why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them ?
you ' re really good with people .
how ' s mr . <person> ?
may i ?
omigod . that ' s it , isn ' t it ?
you can ' t .
why ? i was helpful last time -
<person> , he has one arm .
they think we ' re just a couple of hacks .
where you going ?
first class , bhai . where else ?
can i help you ?
yes . do you have haggis ?
but the plague
yes , i know . but he was always hanging around the house .
i guess i didn ' t realize how big i was until i saw it on your faces .
how -- and i say this with love -- how could you not realize it ?
that ain ' t much of a name .
it ' s easy to remember . <person> .
you ' re not hearing me .
you can change a directive , <person> . you ' ve done it before . <person> to me . he ' s going somewhere in <person> . <person> was never anything but a bus stop . <person> is the nuclear site . there are no roads in there . she was teaching him to hitchhike . i ' m telling you . we block the four roads into <person> and we got him .
<person> .
hi , arlene . come on . <continued_utterance> hi . this is cristina . the girl i ' m always raving about . this is <person> . the school director .
never !
well , i am to deptford now , i leave my respects , <person> .
<person> right . they come here , drink our water , use our fields , they leave all their crap in our drains -
<person> ! <person> !
mahogany . i ' d say that cost at least a couple hundred . maybe three .
three ? we should hock it . buy a c . d . rack for the bedroom .
that big lie about my wanting him to get it back means he ' s going to put my lighter on that island !
<person> , you ' ll have to get there before he does . you won ' t have time to play , you ' d better tell them .
you just woke up !
<person> and i - we took the boat out , we were fishing , and then it was dawn and we ' d caught absolutely nothing .
where can i find him ?
the <person> . <continued_utterance> you tell <person> i went to my sister ' s in ronkonkoma . oh , i ' m sorry about trying to kill you last night , theo . it was nothing personal . <person> puts on a pair of sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of gravel and dust .
you mean people ? i don ' t know . we just cry . you know . when it hurts .
pain causes it ?
bless me , i thought it was a horse .
i am going to church .
i don ' t think that ' s a good idea . he is a very important man , <person>-
- get me the supervisor on this line now-
she is looking at hunsecker .
yes or no , <person> . ?
still well on our side . <continued_utterance> i think it ' s worth a look . <person> ' t worry , <person> , we ' ll get you to betazed with time to spare .
thank you , sir .
well , people are always assuming we are .
and you know what happens when people assume . they make an ass out of who ?
<person> will be in on tuesday .
you ' ll have every bug in christendom -
have you heard of this case ? mrs . x ? she murders her husbands on their honeymoons and then changes her identity and marries again .
i never heard of it . so what ?
so i ' m learning .
he ' s not even aware of it . when you ' ve got his attention you feel like you ' re the only person in the world . that ' s why everybody loves him . other times .
how come you always want to make love to me from behind ? is it because you want to pretend i ' m somebody else ? <person> sighs .
<person> , your ass is gigantic and red , who am i gon na pretend you are ? <person> ? a beat . <continued_utterance> come on , kid . help me with these shower curtains .
yes .
<person> , please hold a moment for the master control program
god . i know where they should have a commune for you . they should have a commune for you at bellevue .

<person> , look at this ! he was writing some kind of diary .
<person> ? what does it say ?

i wish i could go with you . is there anything i can do to help ?

<person> , give him his ball back !
i was thirsty .
there ' s a bathroom upstairs .
<person> `` the gun ? '' or `` mad fist '' <person> ?
you ' re not exactly mr current affairs , are you <person> ? mad fist went mad , and the `` gun '' shot himself .
that ' s so beautiful .
i beg your pardon ?
i said watch where you ' re going , bitch ! <continued_utterance> now what , bitch ? now who ' s the bitch , bitch ?
hey , man . i ' m the bitch . i ' m
there ' s no one here , and i ' ve <continued_utterance> i ' m like a dying person . <continued_utterance> i don ' t sleep . i tell myself this can ' t go on , but it goes on anyway .
i did a terrible thing , ishmael . i knew what you felt . and what i didn ' t . <continued_utterance> and i never found the courage to tell you .
it ' s not even a mile .
we should have driven .
this is a tasting , sir . not a bar .
just give me a full goddamn pour .
it ' s all right .
<person> i know i know
oh man , it ' s a crazy story-

he ' s gay , you dobbin .
<person> , well , you find it awfully charming . my obnoxiousity .
obnoxiousity is not a word .
only rents by the month . two hundred and fifty for the two of them .
this is the last time i expect to see you down here .
what are you talking about ?
just for a second . <continued_utterance> we don ' t have to be those people . <person> ' s watching . they ' ve been masquerading as us for a while here . i ' ll distract them - you make a break for it and i ' ll meet you outside .
<person> . the kids are wonderful . i have a great job at lens shapers .
<person> . you wear a lab coat ?
we got it all right . this is an outpost here , not the third <person> ! you ' ve got us securing thirty-four locations and erecting monitor units in one month and --
piece of cake , guys ! these are totally remote , totally uninhabited territories . all you do is set down , send out a patrol purely as a formality , then have those veterans of yours put up an a-type unmanned monitoring unit . you should be on about number twenty-five by the time i get back from my vacation .
no . i have to go . i have to get back . you don ' t understand ! let me go !
what was he talking about ?
you love me and you ' re not marrying me .
<person> , i don ' t love you .
you think they ' re still up there ?
if they ' re not . we ' d better get used to living in montana .
you look so pale , dear . are you out of vitamins ?
i bought a bottle of them yesterday . <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
you don ' t know what you ' re fucking with here .
tell me .
look , why don ' t you cone here . where are you ?
i come there and you ' ll have the cops waiting .
it ' s all right babe i ' ll get it .
<person> , i ' ll get it when i get home .
i beg you . <person> ! it is <person> .
oh no , not again . <person> ! <person> .
his ashes ?
with love .
<person> me see . it ' s some kind of countdown clock .
countdown to what ?
it ' s the situation . the stress .
. the view .
it ' s better than ice cream .
it ' s better than springtime .
<person> ' t do it , professor !
i know you . and you , young lady . both of you are in my physic class , aren ' t you . ? come . you can help me . i need to get some of these drums to my laboratory . help me . and i ' ll give you special grades . what ' d you say ? suddenly he catches flash with a waldo and starts to choke him . liz screams and tries to help flash .
and i guess , i thought that after that big mess with <person> -- you ' d never want to get married .
i know .
she left us . you know that better than anyone . except me .
amazing artist though . the best living artist . there ' s no one who stares the truth in the face like she does . a sweet pussy , too .
it ' s a secret . but i guess you wouldn ' t understand about that , either .
oh honey , lots of people come to me for love and it ' s a secret .
i can ' t tell you . you ' ve got to see .
uh unh . i won ' t do it .
<person> and politics , yeah , art and politics . <person> ' s look at that . you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich , played in countries the nazis had conquered . are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from <number> on wasn ' t a commercial for <person> and all he stood for ?
we never , never officially represented the regime when we played abroad . we always performed as a private ensemble . as i think i already told you , i was a freelance conductor .
fucking hell , man . i thought you were gon na leave me cold .
i thought you were used to it .
who is `` they '' ?
<person>on ' t ask foolish questions . tell your brother i ' m a sensible man . he understands only two things - power-politics and homage - tell him i came tonight to pay homage !
<person> , what a saucy question !
why do you cheat persistently on your wife ?
<person> wants to destroy it .
well . he doesn ' t think it ' s god , but for different reasons than me . he ' s thinking : if i can figure out how to make it stop , than i am smarter than it is , and therefore it can not be god .
i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . <person> . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
are you talking about me ?
i just put my car in the garage .
go on in .
no , not at all . we were just talking about . <person> and i met yesterday , so .
so i heard . <continued_utterance> so , don ' t you think we look alike ?
<person> , the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial star destroyer .
<person> up !
oh dear .
<person> key .
you ' ve had worse from shaving . what ' d you do to set him off ?
<person> ' ! <person> came in to say fare-thee-well . <person> ' t you heard ? his parole came through !
not if you were the only man in the world .
but i am the only man in the world .
eight o ' clock .
it ' s five thirty now . you could come get me now and take me to the police tonight and then go to <person> ' s --
i couldn ' t resist .
any other surprises you left in my head , you fuckin ' dead man , you ?
aye-aye , captain .
and if they want to drink <person> , we ' re drinking <person> .
berries .
yes . like i was putting them into my big basket . clearing the hillside of its children . <continued_utterance> <person> and i used to do a lot of that in the spring .
hi . <person> ?
yes ?
right this way , please .
oh , wow , look at that ass . i could follow that forever . <continued_utterance> nice pick . <person> and brandon walk on towards the bar .
a modern . impressionist . renaissance .
but don ' t want museums to know where it is .
but i don ' t care about that now . he knew what he was doing today . he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage - if i would bend to every whim of his , like <person> ! i couldn ' t do that , <person> .
after a pause , she says : <continued_utterance> you ' re saying goodbye , aren ' t you ?
you know what it is , <person> . <continued_utterance> it ' s the squid ! stop it !
stop what ? what are you -- ?
hey look . you think i ' m gon na run out on ya or somethin ' ? just cause we hit it big . <person> , i owe you everything . if you hadn ' t taught me con , i wouldn ' t know nothin ' .
aw hell , you sound like some goddamn sucker . you know everything i know . you got nothin ' more to learn from me .
hey , don ' t thank me or anything .
<person> , right -- thanks . <continued_utterance> hey -- your prayers have been answered . i ' m leaving . in just a couple of days .
maybe it doesn ' t matter if he ' s a good dancer cause it ' s a slow song , if that ' s what he ' s afraid of .
no . maybe that ' s not the case . maybe she shouldn ' t be such a smug little shit because she ' d be surprised at what a good dancer he really is , but it ' s been a long time and he doesn ' t know if he ' s ready to .
. medallions of pork with a dusting of black truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped potatoes . and finally a copper river salmon grilled on an alder wood plank . and that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed watercress . <continued_utterance> and who gets the wine list ?
i guess <person> wants it .
or teach it a better tune .
how long is a movie script these days ? i mean , how many pages ?
i ' m not fighting with you , puss . she gets up and walks around in considerable agitation .
he never would have killed himself if i hadn ' t gone through with the annulment . <person> ' t you see that made all the rumors seem true ? i should have stood up for him . not run out .
i ' m all right , ma . <person> ' t worry about me .
you look so pale , dear . are you out of vitamins ?
<person> went to new york .
to the yankees ?
you ' re not much with girls , are you ?
well , iris , i look at it this way . a lot of girls come into my cab , some of them very beautiful . and i figure all day long men have been after them : trying to touch them , talk to them , ask them out . and they hate it . so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all . so i don ' t say a thing . i pretend i ' m not even there . i figure they ' ll understand that and appreciate me for it . it takes iris a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking : i am loved to the extent i do not exist .
<person> was washing <person> . in the shower . what did you think that was about ?
sex . of course .
you didn ' t see ?
will you tell me what the hell is going on here ?
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?
we can ' t go down there . we ' re not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , <person> . we ' re just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
was there anything unusual about the driver , <person> , or the bus that particular morning ?
like what ? i mean , i don ' t remember a lot .
where did you learn that ?
the cook .
i didn ' t imagine it -
i ' m not saying you did .
you know i can ' t make that promise .
<person> , clarice . you looked - so very lovely today , in your blue suit .
what ?
the wedding . you and <person> . it was in the papers .
<person> ' t call me <person> . it ' s just <person> now .
<person> .
no , i won ' t .
this <person> boy must be good for you . why not bring him around today , before the show ? this time i ' ll clean my glasses for a better look .
<person> , you just said fuck again .
stanly !
he says you are very beautiful , senora , and he is ashamed to ask five american dollars for this picture , but if he does not , his father will beat him .
that ' s a pretty good hustle , kid . four . <person> .
that ' s for sure .
what happened ?
no .
<person> ' t cry . am i really that bad ?
oh .
i ' ve never known .
it ' s messy . the thing ' s got a gun . we ' re just asking for somebody to get killed .
we don ' t know what else to do . we need results .
<person> , i ' ve decided to get over the whole `` you saw me naked '' thing . so , we don ' t have to deal with it anymore . <person> ?
good , ' cause i ' ve been hiding from you all day .
how did you end up on <person> ?
they sent me there to die . how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines ? it was . . i was a slave . and a monster . the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me . but one man took pity on me : the man who became my viceroy . he taught me how to survive . and in that dark place , where there was nothing of myself , i found my reman brothers . they showed me the only kindness i ever knew . <continued_utterance> for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister- planet . but the time has come for us to live as equals .
she ran away . about six months ago .
where did she go ?
but he isn ' t going to like this , <person> . and he makes you nervous , not me . no , i take that back - he makes me nervous , too . but i wouldn ' t give him a second thought if not for you .
<person> ' s forget him and -
. wouldn ' t that be dangerous ?
. not if you ' ve got something to hold on to .
no . <person> . <person> , please .
<person>s . no problem . how would you like ' m ?
and if they succeed , humans won ' t make <person> with the vulcans tomorrow . as <person> i should be the one beaming down .
normally , i would agree . but in this case , the mission requires a certain knowledge of <number> st century history . you ' re many things , <person> , but you ' re not much of an historian .
here are some pajamas .
you expect me to wear his pajamas ?
what do you want ?
looks like you stirred things up around here last night , stranger .
my gosh , <person> .
<person> , it was awful .
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants .
what assistant ?
err , because we didn ' t . now <person> we have or rather you have a problem .
what ?
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed . and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like .
all right . truth . i believe that one . why is it so urgent you couldn ' t wait until morning ?
well --
that ' s my last word -- think it over . <continued_utterance> how do you do , ladies --
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
we ' re a small convent , <person> . surely there are . more appropriate shelters .
yes .
not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question . better than making the tea , no ?
i don ' t know , i just found out about this .
i ' m telling you , if you never go back to college you ' ll regret it for the rest of your life . the memories i have of being a freshman -- those were three of the happiest years of my life .
oh i can see you ' ve had a bad day . we ' ll see the house another time , okay ?
no ! no ! i ' m sorry . ninety-seven five right ?
what kind of things ?
you know , us .
you hate him ? cole shakes his head , `` no . ! <continued_utterance> your mom set that up ? <continued_utterance> you ever tell her about how it is with <person> ?
i don ' t tell her a thing .
hey , sisters -- how you doin ' ?
better now .
he ' s so dreamy . he ' s like . a greek god . he ' s the cutest guy here . he ' s boss . he ' s fab . he ' s .
yes , <person> ?
no , travis . you ' re a sweet guy and all that , but i think this is it .
you mean you don ' t want to go to a movie ? there ' s plenty of movies around here .
how about dinner tonight ?
<person> and i got plans .
<person> , with all due respect to diplomatic protocols -- the federation council ' s not sitting out here , we are .
<person> . <person> is a very exacting occupation . we can wait .
stop ! i don ' t want to know . <person> still . so . it was <person> that ordered you here ?
i volunteered .
i am sorry .
then you could kiss me .
are you joking , man ? let ' s see here . she dated <person> , <person> , <person> and what ' s-his-face . all of those were cool guys . she ' s been hot way longer than you think . why would she end her high school career with me ?
well , <person> got with <person> .
they ' re from both of us .
a famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday . <person> ' t i feel special ?
oh , yeah . i ' m late . <person> .
you look handsome .
oh my !
what is it , <person> ?
very good , sir .
commander , i don ' t know how they did it on the talos , but we have door chimes on the enterprise . we use them .
you got your camera ?
sure , but i can ' t --
you make your customers ' motives a part of your business ?
if you wanted a toothbrush , i wouldn ' t ask questions . i ' d just quote a price . a toothbrush , see , is a non-lethal sort of object .
i know , but she did . she ' s with someone else now .
already ? you poor thing . it won ' t last .
fine . do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains ? the gangbangers ' ll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground . and when the fires start the street cops ' ll be capping off at anything that moves . it ' ll be all- out war and you know it .
<person> , well maybe it ' s time for a war !
hold tight <person> , when in rome .
i am not in rome doug , i am in a rush . <continued_utterance> i got ta make the bookies .
so then this isn ' t crazy . it ' s a sure bet .
well . <continued_utterance> i guess we ' re in this together . <continued_utterance> but , we have to make a smart plan !
it ' s okay , i am done for .
no , i mean we can ' <person> without you - we don ' t know where the hell we are ! !
so we ' ll go for <person> .
promise ?
please . what were you going to say ?
you badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won ' t even consider forgiving <person> for something he did six months ago .
found it under a pot .
well for fuck ' s sake . <person>id you nick my t-shirt ?
it ' s not in synch with evolution .
<person> up !
sure , lots of times . what a brainiac .
yeah . have you seen him today ?
you seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?
hans <person> was in the ministry of culture ; how could i know such a man ? i brief silence ; a smile . <continued_utterance> i hear the british have his . his archive , files , records .
how are you getting on with these fine people ?
like dykes and dogs .
it ' s very pretty , <person> . thank you .
you gon na play something ?
sounds familiar .
how ' d she put the rubber on with her mouth ?
not really . <person> ' t be right .
well , i ' m not that nice a person . <continued_utterance> she plays <person> . <person> to the barbies , like <person> talking to her . <continued_utterance> brings her cigarette . to the flame . <continued_utterance> she says she ' s sorry she left them . it was just to see if they could be good girls . and they were . <continued_utterance> . and she loves them . <continued_utterance> the barbies look better naked , <person> looks good in blue , guess who said that ? <continued_utterance> so we talked . just before <person> left her with that . stranger ? <person> had snapped her mom ' s bead necklace . that ' s why she ' s making more . <continued_utterance> when she ' s made enough . she ' ll be forgiven . <continued_utterance> she saves <person> a room at the house , but she ' s also got the key to the old place . in case her mom would rather go there .
<person> , let ' s see . how long were you in the camp for ?
three months .
no , your wife wouldn ' t let me leave this morning .
ah ! hey , that ' s not cool .
i want you to get <person> to abandon his plan .
what plan ?
i don ' t sleep well , anymore .
because of your mother ?
you got ta get that girl out of your head . it ' s time to move on . you ' re a stylish , successful , good looking cat . the ladies want to love you , you just got ta let them .
that ' s bullshit .
i ' d heard that . but she ' s well ?
yes . fine .
so you said at the time . speaking of which , your protg ' s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
she ' s half <person> , <person> . the admixture makes her more volatile than -- me , for example .
they ' re going to execute her . <person> , a few minutes ago you said you didn ' t want to just wait here to be captured . now all you want to do is stay .
marching into the detention area is not what i had in mind .
but the key is to be good at sex by the time you ' re in college . you don ' t want girls to think you suck dick at fucking .
i still think you ' ve got a chance with <person> . she got mad hot over last summer , and clearly hasn ' t realized it , `cause she still flirts with you .
no , i didn ' t forget sexy .
just didn ' t get around to it , huh ?
if i told you that there ' s a terrorist on this train , that i was sent here to catch him , would you believe me ?
most fervently .
plug in . he should be able to interpret the entire imperial computer network .
he says he ' s found the main computer to power the tractor beam that ' s holding the ship here . he ' ll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor . <continued_utterance> the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations . a power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave .
why ? you got money from <person> ' insurance with the school board . we all did .
it ' s not enough . for hospital bills . for <person> .
i saw part of the message he was .
i seem to have found it .
the walkers have agreed . the ottos . <person> ' s parents . it ' s important to initiate proceedings right away . things get covered up . people lie . that ' s why we have to begin our investigation quickly . before the evidence disappears .
i know <person> and wendell walker . they wouldn ' t hire a goddamned lawyer . and the ottos wouldn ' t deal <continued_utterance> with you . we ' re not country bumpkins you can put a big city hustle on . you ' re trying to use us .
you thought the deceased might .
of course not . we ' re just not quick to run and boast . in case something went wrong .
he was stealing my baby .
you ' re wrong ! ! he would never do anything like that ! ! let ' s go .
pride ? ! ? <person> , you ' re young , and you don ' t have a very firm grip on politics . i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time .
<person> , <person> ' lady . i was only trying to .
how was it hard ?
well , i left someone very special behind .
<person> . it was funny . but it cost me money .
come on , amigo , the world ' s full of marks . and nobody knows how to work ' em like you do , pal . you could sell a goddamn rat ' s asshole for a wedding ring ! let me buy you a drink .
<person> .
<person> , <person> , this is <person> .
- i want you .
i ' m going to buy you a red nightgown with satin and lace .
you know him !
well of course , of course i know him . he ' s me ! i haven ' t gone by the name obi-wan since oh , before you were born .
i ' m not getting a divorce .
why , you little doublecrosser . i didn ' t want this divorce , you did . that ' s what you ' ve been harping about for the past year .
sure .
i ' m pregnant .
where were you ?
i went to the wrestling , wanted to see that <person> , but he didn ' t show up .
there are no locks anywhere in this house .
how come ?
gently put it ' s head down there ; then quick in the skull with an air rifle . pluck it while it ' s warm , little pot to catch all the blood -
do you enjoy doing that ?
you shouldn ' t smoke so many of those .
i know , but it keeps down the size of my can .
it ' s just impossible .
nobody can be that busy .
it ' s like .
<person> , can you tell me about the sphere ?
go on , i want you to tell me .
well , she was dark , not too tall , rather pretty --
<person> down , you two . it ' s always like this .
<person> , well , now , she goes out with a ' better class of people . <person> .
yes .
class of ' <number> ?
i don ' t have it with me . tell <person> .
<person> ' s through with you . he has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser .
the is a dead russian on my lap sol i am not thinking about hitting anybody right now .
well you better start thinking <person> because otherwise you ' ll be fuckin lucky if you end up looking like that .
can i help you ? <person> , i ' m really busy .
<person> , um , my dad ' s a butcher , do you need a hand ?
you took me to see the beatles .
oh , <person> , i really liked you . you ' re <person> . . <person> . we did . we saw the beatles together . how the hell have you been ? what happened to you ?
capillaries .
and they ' re filled with blood .
it ' s more than that -- lately , i haven ' t been feeling a connection to --
what ? me ?
how long did you live there ?
two months .
please tell me you ' re not making this up .
no . it ' s there . what do you think it means ?
where can i find him . ?
he is looking for <person> <number> i ' m sure .
maybe you and <person> should stay with my mom . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t start . the only reason is that the neighborhood ' s shi . . crummy . i just don ' t like the idea of leaving you alone here at night .
i can still use a gun .
and all he cared about was doing his duty . that ' s all . that ' s all . he used to tell me .
i ' m so sorry .
he has made the choice , <person> . with your own eyes you saw it yesterday .
oh --
`` age of enlightenment '' . <person> . like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference . how demeaning . i may as well have just said `` let me jump your ignorant bones . `` .
. <person> .
my pants cost more than your education .
<person> blooded .
it was so big , i thought it was a tea cozy for your car . but if it ' s for me , it has to be bigger , huh ?
well . you ' ll grow into it .
oh , i don ' t care , i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and it ' s pissing me off .

but there was a lot of firing earlier . <continued_utterance> hey , easy with those .
what are you doing ?
i bought a couple of tickets .
you sure right ?
you know about signs <person> ? not like the ones people write on . it ' s like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it . then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled . they ' re things that happen by chance or luck , but make you feel that someone ' s watching out for you .
i never really thought about it .

to lose one son so young , then to lose the other two years later ; to think you ' ve lost him . that must have been devastating .
<person> was very charismatic and outgoing . <person> was introverted . he never thrived like <person> . he was a very disturbed young man . <person> was <person> ' s world . <person> never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him . he changed . <person> began to intimidate me . he could be very menacing . he began imitating <person> at school and that lead to fights with other students . at sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away . a few days later the thunder bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire .
you didn ' t even see it .

you ' ve had no head trauma , no serious viral infections you can recall , you haven ' t been out of the country , you ' re not a drug user , you have no history of migraines . i suppose i could open up your skull in the operating room and then decide what to do , but i ' d rather take a few pictures first , wouldn ' t you ?
if <person> is beyond our comprehension , and she -- -- is here for reasons that can ' t be understood , isn ' t <person> here ?
not necessarily .
i ' d like a shot at laertes . i think it ' s a much better part .

<person> .
now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school . the first time they meet .
how about `` <person> you ' re a douche bag for kissing <person> ? ''
that ' s a curse .
if i can ever repay your kindness . it would be my great pleasure . <continued_utterance> . and your ms . <person> ? a remarkable young woman .
we think so .
wow !
i ' ll just try the first one . <continued_utterance> <person> ! it ' s a lady giving a blow job to a horse ! <person> and <person> rush over .
no , she didn ' t <person> . but i think you should do the scene .
wally .
sir , yes , sir !
the live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide . if you do not hit your target , it will shoot you . <person> blackened automated target drones fitted with pulse guns <continued_utterance> the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury , but if you are hit , you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly . <person> , has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
has it ?
i love you so much .
just do it . i knew they wouldn ' t let me die . at least you can make me forget all of this . i hope . <continued_utterance> what are you waiting for ? you ' re just doing your job . i ' d do the same thing if i was you . at least you ' ve got a shot at saving those people on the bridges .
i doubt it .
you can stop . i will go on alone .
we ' re too far away to walk . <person> ' t you understand ?
just tell me one thing ! how many of them are there and are they armed ?
there in a man . one man . he was found in the trench by several children . <continued_utterance> this man was not armed .
that ' s bullshit .
is it ?
you ' re really gon na bail on me ? !
<person> .
but that doesn ' t add , does it .
no it doesn ' t .
. that ' s right .
one man .
he ' s not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking <person> .
<person> down , <person> . <person> ?
you can ' t do that . can you ?
you can in opera .
tell him the fbi is after him .
you ' re joking .
yes . about that , you are right .
you sold her .
you have to do what i say ? !
that is one of my mission parameters .
wow . we got ta give it a moment , but this is tasty . really good . how about you ?
i think they overdid it a bit . <person> much alcohol . overwhelms the fruit .
i bet . you ' ve traveled a long way , huh ? god must have something special in mind for you . <continued_utterance> what happened there ?
uh . when i boy . um . i don ' t know --
rheya .
it started about three months ago . right after the government sold the expedition . we were ready to go home .
you love me ? ! i thought we decided not to fall in love . that we would be forced to live a lie .
i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway . my love for you is a puzzle , <person> , for which i have no answers . i can ' t control it . and now i don ' t care . i truly , deeply love you , and before we die i want you to know .
hi , <person> . <person> , this is <person> .
it ' s nice to meet you , <person> .
i don ' t know . it ' s a hard grape to grow . as you know . it ' s thin-skinned , temperamental , ripens early . it ' s not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected . <person> needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked- away corners of the world . and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really , can tap into <person> ' s most fragile , delicate qualities . only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can <person> be coaxed into its fullest expression . and when that happens , its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet . <continued_utterance> i mean , cabernets can be powerful and exalting , but they seem prosaic to me for some reason . by comparison . how about you ?
what about me ?
then we ' ll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization .
mrs . <person> , the v-chip hasn ' t been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .
<person> ' s got people who can fix him .
no , thanks .
i ' d really like to see what you ' re working on . unless you ' re worried i won ' t like it .
it ' s private . and your opinion doesn ' t interest me .
<person> , i ' m going to ask you to hand me the keys to your vehicle , please .
of course .
sure .
uh , look , <person> .
suppose you listen just for a minute -
madame is waiting .
sure .
when will my case be heard by the tribunal ?
that is just the wrong thing to say right now , <person> . you should go .
i ' m so glad i finally got you .
no way . this would just provide some stability is what i ' m saying . i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there , you know , keep myself in the game in case something big comes along .
uh-huh .
i ' m trying to get you some action , but you ' ve got to help me out just a little bit .
<person> ' t seem to me like that ' s what was going on . you were all over her .
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe .
that ' s not sayin ' much .
we looking for you . how you sleep ?
i slept fine . i decided i ' m not my father . i don ' t run out on the people i care about just because some blond shakes her ta-ta ' s at me .
we passed it a few blocks back , where the police were . the palazzo gioia . they don ' t even know i ' m in rome and i ' m not going to incriminate <person> -
perhaps i shouldn ' t go either .
what happened ?
where were you ?
if i was , i would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin . now <person> , why didn ' t you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man ? look how i ' m dressed . i ' ve got to run and put my face on .
you look fabulous , mrs . <person> .
they work for the people we ' re trying to sue . their job is to try to minimize damages . our job , <person> , is to try to maximize them . you have to think of it that way . as people doing their jobs . no good guys or bad guys . just our side and their side .
i won ' t lie .
so the defendant was encouraged to hope . or could have been .
i guess so .
that ' s what i ' m afraid of . did i tell you that my perfect sister and her perfect husband are getting a perfect divorce- ?
i have the perfect cure . <person> away from love .
<person> , if you please .
the next signature is one kilometer to the south . <person> starts the jeep in motion .

he said that his wish is for everyone who died in the war to come back .
that ' s what i love about you <person> , no small talk .
i said we should come round and raise fuckin hell , you know shoot a few of the boys and that , but he said he thinks we would have more success if we paid for it . so i am going to have a drink and let you two discuss what you have to discuss . <continued_utterance> alright big man , i hope you aren ' t bitter about your cousin <person> .

just so you know : i ' m not going back until i understand what it is . i am going to figure out what it is , make it stop , and then i will go home .
<person> --
i am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom i feel i can trust , and i am appealing to you , because i regard you in the same way my uncle surely must have . i heartily dislike and distrust judge <person> --
huh -- <person> girl --
he ' s got the plutonium , and he ' s on his way back to the lab ! and he ' s got two prisoners with him . <person> and <person> !
<person> ' t worry . he needs a huge amount of power . thousands of volts of electricity . to get to the anti-force .
it ' s the truth .
you recall lt . <person> ' s testimony ? he and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found . so no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims . that ' s also rather convenient , isn ' t it , mr . <person> ?
no , you don ' t understand -- i don ' t want to get out ! i want to get in ?
excuse me ?
<person> to me . <person> was playing <person> in london in <number> , and <person> could not get a ticket . she said , `` i ' m not doing the seven shows a week i signed for . `` she said , `` i can not bare my soul seven times a week . i am an artist . i ' ll do four shows a week . `` the greatest actress of her time . you know what her producer said ?
what ?
eating is eating . and .
and talking is talking ! well , i think we better get on .
not necessarily .
stop equivocating ! unbelievable , how you equivocate ! you , the atheist , you ' re more dogmatic than any holy person i ' ve ever seen ! this is happening , <person> . <person> up .
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .
you think it ' s me ? you think i ' m saying there was a conversation when there wasn ' t ?
i ' ve got <person> .
has he had any contact with them ?
it didn ' t start out so beautiful .
that ' s true of lots of things .
mom . when is the war gon na be over ?
i don ' t know honey . soon we hope . you want it to end quickly , huh ?
never , sir .
take her out , mr . <person> .
<person> world is that ?
the ' real ' world . besides , did you know that there are more students in law school than there are practicing lawyers ?
i never thought it would end like this .
all things must end , mr . <person> .
no , it ' ll run independently .
ah . <person> good . well , we should have you running again in a couple of days , i hope .
one question remains . why . is that . <person> boat ?
well . a boat ' s a boa .
i don ' t know what your deal is . one second you ' re so there , then all i get is the badge .
i apologize if you ' ve been getting the wrong signal .
well , i ' m just beginning to develop my theme . <person> ' t that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? <person> , so they played on your insecurity . that ' s human , understandable . but , there is one guy who doesn ' t like little k as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , <person> . he thinks you ' re the greatest , and when he says , i want <person> for my birthday , boy , they better go out get <person> . so , <person> calls and threatens you with little k . and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna , i ' ll give it to <person> as a birthday present in berlin . that ' s the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . <person> . <person> did you stay ? <person> did you play for them ? <person> were you the flag-carrier for their regime ? <person> ?
of course there was a conspiracy against me , a campaign - even abroad .
yes .
you don ' t sound french .
no you wouldn ' t . i mean , she ' s great . she ' s totally brilliant , but she ' s not your type .
you ' re overlooking one of the great things about me . i don ' t have a type .
all the time . they ' re everywhere . you won ' t tell anyone my secret , right ?
. no .
heard you got remarried ! congratulations . <person> ' t think you had the stomach for another go-round .
oh , <person> . you ' re drunk .
he won ' t break off now . if he followed me this far he ' ll be back .
he ' s intelligent , but not experienced . his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking .
i ' m sorry , <person> . so much pressure lately . you feel like going for a drink ?
thank you , no . i have some work to do . assuming i can still log on . he exits .
she ' s been leaving messages here too .
<person> . <person> .
like this place ?
i like my old convent , in vancouver . out in the woods . it wasn ' t all modern , like here . no electricity . cold water . <person> feet . those were nuns . it was <person> on earth , but i loved it . this place is a hilton .
<person> , you did fine .
`` age of enlightenment '' . <person> . like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference . how demeaning . i may as well have just said `` let me jump your ignorant bones . `` .
maybe you need to stop thinking so much and fall in love again .
<person> stinks .
really , what do you look for in women you date ?
well , i know everyone always say `` sense of humor '' , but i ' d have to go with breast size . how about you ? in a guy .
you got ta be kidding me . the new guys ' ll be short-stroking it over this one . a one-day pattern killer .
i hate the weird ones .
that you didn ' t die ? like the other children ?
yes . <person> and the ansel twins and sean and .
she ' s a four year old !
she ' s almost over eleven now . she ' s my muse . i love her .
shaqed .
well , just watch the t-bone and learn .
paul that is not my mother . that is his second wife . he met <person> making `` the lost man '' . he left my mother who had stuck by him in the lean years . <person> had just been born . `` the lost man '' is the only film of my father ' s i can ' t bring myself to see .
oh , i ' m sorry . we didn ' t mean to -
there ' s nothing in my right hand .
could i see it , please . ? <continued_utterance> you put your wedding ring back on .
you sure you didn ' t say anything to maya ?
sure i ' m sure . and just what are you implying ? i ' m really pissed off at you about all this , if you want to know the truth . what ' s maya going to think of me now just for associating with you ? you ' re the one who ' s sabotaging me , not the other way around , pal . not by a longshot .
it ' s a violent response to something we haven ' t figured out . <person> ' t let the cowardly demeanor fool you : he is ruthless . unblinking in his prejudice .
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me . <continued_utterance> do i really feel like . i am . ?
no .
you ' re a liar .
<person> ' s see your lawyer and get this over with .
did you bring the money , <person> ? lawyers are expensive .
sure .
how ' s <person> ?
what ?
it ' s not about the kids . <continued_utterance> that thing you said before . pushing the guy sleeping next to you away . because of what you gave up for motherhood .
will i ever laugh again ? i ' m serious .
yes .
it can ' t be , that would mean we slept eight hours .
impossible . <continued_utterance> how ya doin ' ace ? whoa nelly . little dizzy .
<person> , i don ' t understands who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway . all you got ta do is push a button , sir !
put your hand on the post , private .

i want to know now .
and if she runs ?
take care of it .
that ' s more like it ! now i want you all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces ! <person> hold of your tools and show ' em to me !
you heard the lady . <continued_utterance> c ' mon ! we ' re showin ' our tools and grinnin ' like fools ! take the damn picture !
and just as <person> convinced herself that the dog wasn ' t for her .
she ' s been fixed , but she hasn ' t lost the urge .
glenn <person> . the golf pro at the falmouth hills country club . the man you had recently discovered was her lover . did you follow her ?
i went to a few bars first . later , i decided to drive to mr . <person> ' s home and confront them . they weren ' t there . so i parked my car in the turnout . and waited .
then i ' ll have the number four with one of your finest whips .
how do you want it ? the eggs .
<person> , no thanks .
<person> edge ?
no , sir . no nothing .
there are two possibilities , sir they are unwilling to respond , they are unable to respond .
it ' s private . and your opinion doesn ' t interest me .
so you scribble away on that thing so as not to deal with people . <continued_utterance> they ' re amazing .
you ' re using her as bait ? ?
it was her idea . no harm will come to her . i can sense everything going on in that room .
not really . sometimes . not right now .
so now you get my theory about love ? you got ta self protect . it ' s too dangerous .
<person> , if you ' ll excuse me , i ' m not in jail .
from <person> ' s viewpoint . <continued_utterance> sure you ' re in jail , <person> . you ' re a prisoner of your own fears , of your own greed and ambition ; you ' re in jail .
no , officer .
all right , move it .
i read this book where he said something like , `` if you have the opportunity to help someone and don ' t , then you ' re wasting your life . `` and he was a carpenter too .

inside the sphere . <person> , that ' s the vertical torso , three legs , two arms . there ' s no head , so i ' m guessing the creature ' s head is located within the torso itself , you know ?

yes . well , it was nice meeting you . did i say `` meeting '' ? ugh , i ' m such an idiot .
<person> , <person> , how can i get through to you ? you ' re not just a soldier . somewhere inside you ' re a human being , too . somewhere inside you ' ve got to know that this is wrong . <person> is wrong . and if you can ' t grasp that , if you just follow orders , then you ' re just as much a prisoner as i am .
what ' s your question ?
<person> , i know what i ' m doing . trust me . what ' s the news .
i can ' t believe i ' m doing this , but that girl who confused to <person> ' s murder also confessed to other murders .
-- and a white one for blood pressure . . .

i did not , <person> .
<person> , sir .
<person> , on my mark .
the prisoner is being interrogated .

i ' m picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system .

<person> is a good idea . he can help with my luggage . thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe . and thanks for the use of all the trinkets . he takes the cigarette case and throws it on the chaise longue . then he throws the lighter , the <continued_utterance> the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer .
you know the wire at all ?
no . i never played no big con before . but <person> was a friend a mine . i thought maybe there was something i could do .
like this bandleader .
well , he ' s more than just a bandleader , <person> . he ' s a great conductor , a gifted artist . but we believe that he sold himself to the devil . your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the nazi party . <person> ' t be impressed by him . i want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war . find wilhelm <person> guilty . he represents everything that was rotten in germany . <person> wants to rise , but <person> puts a hand on his shoulder to make him sit again . <continued_utterance> <person> put , <person> . there is some other stuff that i ' d like for you to see here . background . <continued_utterance> oh , one thing that may be a problem . our occupation authorities in wiesbaden have a duty to help these poor unfortunates with their defence . they keep repeating : ' we must be just , we must be seen to be just . ' well , i ' ve only one thing to say to the liberals in wiesbaden : fuck ' em . you answer to no one but me . is that understood ? show him the film .
so he hunts people and wears their lives as a kind of trophy .
more like a kind of camouflage .
little league .

you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere , you remember that -- when the sphere opened ? that ' s right . but you can ' t remember going inside , can you ? no , of course not . <person> couldn ' t either , could he ? `` like everything ' s on the tip of my tongue '' , he said .
you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions .
i was going to remind you of nothing , least of all that which you know well . your mistake , if i may be so bold , was promotion . commanding a starship is your first best destiny . anything else is a waste of material .
there ' s so much you don ' t know . you are so . smart and so stupid - paul slams the side of the phone booth .
never say i ' m stupid -
<person> guy ? be specific .
<person> . shell oil . <person> , i don ' t have intel experience . why do you have me doing this ?
most fervently .
then tell me which one you ' d arrest .
you ' re being tricked . <person> picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors . he ' s figured out they ' re made of subatomic particles called neutrinos , and he ' s going to create a negative neutrino field . twenty four hours a day , until they ' re back on earth .

<person> is what you ' re doing to me now ! ! ! <person> is pointing a gun at me and taking me from my house ! <person> is changing yourself into my husband . i don ' t know what you are and i don ' t care . i just want to get away from you !

he turned out all right .
you don ' t have to .
i want to .
i think you better go to the doctor and get some shots .
i used a rubber . she put it on me with her mouth .
that ' s the cheesiest line i ' ve ever heard .
you trained to be an artist . <continued_utterance> you got a ' s in line drawing and oil painting . but your work didn ' t sell . you took a job answering phones in a law firm .
you can stay here .
i ' ll come early tomorrow .
room service !
what are you doing here at this hour ?
hate or love . it works the same .
your client ' s wife ever mention ? we go way ba . nels her mother . may have said something . <continued_utterance> we don ' t let go , you s .
who ' s been talking to you about what i ' m feeling ? who should care about what i ' m feeling ?
dolores , people have to know that you ' ve suffered too . <continued_utterance> and they won ' t understand until you let me clear your name - your good name - once and for all . will you let me do that ? will you let me do my duty ?
yes , <person> .
leaving a tissue sample in the care of a mexican lab ? are you fucking kidding me ?

insurrection . now , come on , <person> , you must have been in love with somebody , sometime .
once , in junior high . i played guitar in a group and fellin love with our singer who did ' we ' ve only just <person> ' as sweet as <person> . i got high on cheap champagne and pledged my love . next day she ran off with the bass player named <person> and i traded my guitar in for a battered <person> typewriter .
please give me a second to think . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
some people call me freak .
only the crazies . i tend to be suspicious of all true believers . present company included .
so i ' m a fanatic .
huh -- <person> girl --
but my aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him , and now wants me to place all my affairs in the judge ' s hands and return east . such is certainly not my wish .
staring . consequently , when he approached me on his way out i wasn ' t surprised , but i didn ' t let on .
he was writing a special sunday piece on . ?
i don ' t think so , <person> . uh .
forget it . thanks .
you don ' t drink ?
i think it weakens you psychically . like it creates these cracks and then bad things can seep in and maybe never go away .
yeah , right .
some tips . <person> ' t dart your eyes around . <person> ' t look in the mirror or you ' ll id yourself . ok ? you got a half hour of tape , so give me some lead-in to the main event . but don ' t wait too long , i don ' t want to be going out for popcorn . and don ' t act natural . <person> ' t act at all . just forget the thing is on . got it ?

you haven ' t signed everything over to that <person> , have you ?
no -- and because i refused , <person> said she would sign an affidavit that i ' m still underage , and then , as my guardian she can do what she likes .
the b- <number> is like a slow child , sir . and <person> , in his own way , has assumed the position of a parent or guardian . i ' m afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences . he ' ll be disappointed when the b- <number> can not meet those expectations .
as much as we care for him , <person> . we have to remember that <person> isn ' t capable of disappointment .
i didn ' t want to spoil our supper .
you ' d rather spoil our walk home .
how much he sign for ?
forty-five .
that ' s probably why they ' re happy . <person> , let ' s stop living together . get married and start really living together !
<person> , please . <person> ' s not talk about it tonight . this party means a lot to kirbo . the floor ' s filthy again .

somebody has to save our skins . into the garbage chute , wise guy .

you ' re not here .
<person> logical , <person> . but your heart doesn ' t constrain itself to mere logic . . your heart longs to discover me . to know me . . to leave all of this behind and be with me . he pushes her against the wall , with passion and almost violence .
can ' t be .
it says here `` photos by <person> <person> . ``

i think she was a passenger on our last voyage . a person of some importance , sir -- i believe . our captain was attached to .

<person> ?
open your eyes .
if you ' re trying to impress me <person> , i want you to know i ' m not easy . <person> , i ' m impressed . now put me down , <person> .

there ' s about $ <number> here . and a hotline code number . they ' ll patch you through to me , wherever i am .
you need to remember that you still have a long way to go , a lot of hard work ahead of you before you make it . first , there ' s getting your shot in the american minor leagues : rookie ball , single , double , triple a - all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark . so , you better pull it together quick .
<person> nobody ' s gon na take this shit from a couple dominican rookies when you go to the u . s . for spring training this season . they glance up , eyes wide . did he just say .

it ' s a skill , she ' s proud of it . and she brings her dolls along . and she looks good in blue . and she wears a key for a good luck charm .
and she ' s saving her mother a room . did she tell you that ?
shut up , <person> . never mind . <person> ' ll tell you next year .

the borg will undoubtedly attack . set phasers to rotating modulation . the security officers check their phasers and wait as <person> and worf finish putting on their suits . <person> straps a tool case to his suit .
<person> ?
i ' m smarter than that , i know i am .
<person> . she ' s making it hard for him to concentrate .

<person> ' t it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ?
i understand . <person> , fire up the converters .
<person> , don ' t give in to hate - that leads to the dark side .
<person> , that would be a good move . <continued_utterance> are you chewing gum ?
want some ?
<person> laid a trap , didn ' t they ?
elegant proof of intelligence , isn ' t it ? we thought there might be a brain on p .
i ' ve been meaning to ask you something all night . what do you have on under that skirt ?
you should know . <continued_utterance> st . elmo ' s fire - rev . <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
i want to rent this one .
why don ' t you buy it , only forty bucks .
of course you do . if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people . you ' d be sitting where i am now . at least i hope you would .
and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the federation . i can ' t let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions .
she wanted me to tell you , she saw you dance . <continued_utterance> she said when you were little , you and her had a fight right before your dance recital . you thought she didn ' t come to see you dance . she did . <continued_utterance> she hid in the back so you wouldn ' t see . she said you were like an angel . <continued_utterance> she said , you came to her where they buried her . asked her a question . she said the answer is `` everyday . `` <continued_utterance> what did you ask ?
do i make her proud ?

i can try . i could access the system in the dorm . <person> . and through that i could crack the main line .
oh , i think he ' s a wonderful man .
you want to canvass ?
this scam we got going here was your <continued_utterance> brainstorm , <person> . i admit , i thought it was a rotten idea , but i put up the scratch . and now we got a beautiful thing .
it ' s a beautiful thing .
with the blast shield down , i can ' t even see . how am i supposed to fight ?
your eyes can deceive you . <person> ' t trust them . <continued_utterance> <person> out with your feelings . <continued_utterance> you see , you can do it .
get the readers ' department and see what they have on bases <person> . the secretary exits . <person> takes a pill and washes it down with some milk .
they ' re pretty hot about it over at twentieth , but i think <person> ' s all wet . can you see <person> as a gillis shortstop ? you ' ve got the best man for it right here on this lot . <person> . <person> change of pace for <person> . there ' s another thing : it ' s pretty simple to shoot . lot of outdoor stuff . bet you could make the whole thing for under a million . and there ' s a great little part for <person> . one of the trainers , an oldtime player who got beaned and goes out of his head sometimes .
`` for '' . ?
`` to '' . forget about you . <continued_utterance> i ' ll have to pack a lot of clothes .

like the papers said . we have hearts .
having a heart is not the point . we were hardly taken in . we believed him -- for a few hours . he did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did . he wanted to be your child . <person> ' t let that go . he sat out in that park and said that man is my father . he ' s in trouble and we don ' t know how to help him .
it is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring .
tell me , are you lately humbled in the act of love ? <continued_utterance> how long has it been ?
took it as a souvenir . i ' m sorry !
creeping about in our stuff ? what gives you the right ?

it doesn ' t matter , we ' re done and we both feel good about it . i got ta get back . now <person> , try to think of this as the smartest thing you ' ve ever done for yourself .
<person> .
no ! help me ! goddamnit , it ' s gon na kill us all ! ! !
<person> , are you okay ?
you tell me .
do you fear them ?
you have to add some twists and stuff . maybe they run out of gas .
no gas . hey , that ' s good .
you knew this whole time ?
i think . you know , i think there ' s a reason that i found them . the pictures . because that lead me to you , right ?
<person> .
<person> , the traffic light .
may i lift my eyebrows ? what is this ? what are you trying to do ?
i ' m trying to get <person> to stand up to you . but your manner is so threatening that she ' s afraid to speak !
we ' re on .
what ?
something ' s different about you today .
if i told you that there ' s a terrorist on this train , that i was sent here to catch him , would you believe me ?
something ' s up wi .
you think i didn ' t get that ?
you ' ll fold this experience into your life and be stronger for it .
how do you deal with it ? all the misery and pain and violence .
you were close as kids ?
i pretty much raised her . you know the scene . depressed mother . withdrawn father . my dad was a photographer too .
you re sort of . radiant . your eyes are shining . you ' re rea <number> ly different . <continued_utterance> you ' re . you ' re a nun .
we ' re in a convent ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve got to go .
<person> . that ' s good to hear .
hey , don ' t thank me or anything .
leave me . not `` cleave me . `` reject me . and so i decided to take matters into my own hands and get it over with by .
rejecting me .
i ' ll see what i can do . but it ' s a waste of money .
oh ?
what ? ! but all our paperwork ' s there . my school records , <person> ' s football records .
let me explain something .
hey buddy . let her go .
help me ! ! !
she knew we were listening .
the hammam .
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
you saying you didn ' t ?
aw , <person> , geez . it ' s home .
the federal court met moments ago and voted unanimously for mobilization to destroy the arachnid threat .
prove it .
these `` guests '' are a part of you , of your subconscious . <person> loves me .
no , he can ' t .
then why , <person> ? <person> go in ? <person> put out explosives ? <person> manifest the snakes ?
third . <person> did stunt work for <person> . i come from a picture family . naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star . so i had ten years of dramatic lessons , diction , dancing . then the studio made a test . well , they didn ' t like my nose -- it slanted this way a little . i went to a doctor and had it fixed . they made more tests , and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn ' t like my acting .
nice job .
would you like to tell me whose are the
really , dr . <person> ; you can not ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn .
yes .

if we could change something in your life , anything at all , what would you like that to be ? <continued_utterance> you don ' t have to answer now .
instead of something i want , can i have something i don ' t want ? <continued_utterance> i don ' t want to be scared anymore .
the one in the hat ? she ' s cute .
what are you doing ?
or just as worthless . but i want you in memphis , close to him . maybe when he gets tired of toying with <person> , he ' ll talk to you again . there ' s a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip .
i lied to <person> . i ' ll need some kind of peace offering . can i get the drawings from his cell ?
<person> , you ' re new , so let me tell you how things are . first those guys were wearing blue shorts . that means <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number> concessions . the water world social structure is organized on three levels . at the bottom are the trash rats .
trash rats ?
or perhaps they ' re on the surface .
<person> , scan the planet for life forms .
i ' m lookin ' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap . thought he mighta come in here .
<person> ' t think so . i know everybody in the place and i always bounce the lamsters .
but . wait a minute .
the majority has spoken .
well . you ' ve come to the right place then . <continued_utterance> . and the lamplight o ' er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor . and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor , shall be lifted nevermore ! ``
so this raven just sits there and won ' t go away ?
mr . <person> . did he offer to <continued_utterance> and then your stroke came this summer . and you put your property on the market , i believe you said <person> <number> . <person> , remember , is <continued_utterance> but <person> was a fisherman . and successful at it .
he said he didn ' t want that life no more . he ' d been saving to buy a farm . he was sorry i got sick . but pretty excited to get back his father ' s place . <continued_utterance> <person> and me . was happy for him .

no , we ' re not .
i was just getting some drinks .
<person> , huh ?

i know that bit - you ' re a girl ; you need a man to give you strength ! so what do you pick such weak sisters for ? <person> ' t you know yet that you fight fire with fire , not with tear drops ?
i could almost forgive you if what you did to <person> came from jealousy and love .
i ' m talking about fame . i ' m talking about fortune . i ' m talking about the chance of a lifetime . how ' d you like to be on mtv tomorrow night ?
mtv . ? me ? really ?

they want to be with you <person> , they go to your house to be with their father .
<person> , i know . someone could have told me .
some kind of virus .
nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible .
but remember , darling -- i don ' t work before ten in the morning , and never after <number> : <number> in the afternoon .
<person> up , norma . you ' d be killing yourself to an empty house . the audience left twenty years ago . now face it .

i ' ve been doing a lot of thinking .
i know .
you mean for you . a <number> -year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it ' s best for her if every- one pretends it didn ' t happen ? this isn ' t going to work out .
you ' re damn right . i ' m gon na sick of your imperious bullshit . i never said i was <person> . if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a <number> hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead ! i have a life !
pay her off .
we don ' t have the money .
<person> rico , you ' re jealous !
i can ' t help it .
i trust their fear of this .

i ' ll help you through , too .
stressed .
right . i ' m sorry , <person> , i ' m sorry .

whatever the latest jargon is .
much better , much higher . for example , where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality , these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination . it ' s all aggression .
you can do better than that . they sent you here to offer me a deal .
if you think i ' m enjoying this , you ' re wrong .
no i did not . i did not kill freddie <person> and then kill <person> greenleaf . is he accusing me ? ask him if he ' s accusing me !

mr . <person> , all stop .
i have these strange thoughts , i don ' t know where they come from . i can ' t explain it .
neither can i . not any of it . there ' s no reference point for what ' s going on ; it ' s never happened before . it ' s a clean break in the fabric of the universe ; a gap . there is nothing to do but experience it , moment-to- moment , and not let it destroy us .

you know , i ' ve decided : i ' m just gon na believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing , it ' ll make life so much easier ; the little wife agreeing with her big , strong husband . you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day . he just stares at her -- he really likes this . it ' s familiar , this type of teasing , and it reminds him of when things were good .
like i said , it ' s not possible .
maybe he did know the answers .
have you gone soft , <person> ? professors , lawyers , doctors , general knowledge wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees . and he ' s on ten million ? what the hell can a slum dog possibly know ?

oh , you have <person> <number> access , don ' t you ?
come on , let ' s hear it:
that she may have been . that she may have been delivered - for sale - that she may have been sent down the pipeline and overseas .

yeah . <person> in mystical love . <person> was like that in his life , too . even as he aged , he only had eyes for young women . like , in one essential way he never grew up .
in his trousers .
only <number> in <number> male applicants make it through stellar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
eight point . no , uh , seven .
not even little ones that aren ' t supposed to hurt ?

is there another patient ?
no -- that one ' s for me .
what was that ?
you heard me .
that ' s the local bar ?

god yes . stop that .
you ' re going to the hospital .
i ' ll knock em dead . but you ' ve got to be careful in prison . you have to use condoms .

she ' s got you helping her too ?

and when you visited defendant on his boat . the evening after <person> ' s death . did it seem pretty darn clear to him ?
marge-maintenance .
<person> , aye .

we don ' t have minutes . can you give me phaser power ?
oh , yeh . he said someday he would get his land back .

i like weird . i like you . <person> ? <continued_utterance> anyway . i don ' t want to make you uncomfortable . i just thought it would be a fun diversion . <person> , i do want to make you uncomfortable .
oh , <person> . i wish i could .

so ?
what about that guy who wrote confederacy of dunces ? he committed suicide before he got published , and look how famous he is .

<person> are you giving this to me ?
hi , <person> . who ' s this ?
<person> , this is <person> and .
we ' re a small convent , <person> . surely there are . more appropriate shelters .
your small convent is in danger of closing , <person> . the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation .
this is true . <person> can i commandeer your vehicle ?
well , where are you going ?
wait a minute . now i ' m remembering .
that ' s right . they ' ll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment . the one i left for you at the club was a copy .

you never even took the shot . you couldn ' t do it . theo moves towards <person> in a threatening manner .
i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad . the moment passes . theo turns and climbs into his car . he looks up at <person> .
how could <person> plan on <person> snapping like that ?
he couldn ' t . my guess is <person> intended to kill <person> and make it look like suicide . the authorities would find the body and close the martin <person> file .
pain causes it ?
uh-unh , no , it ' s different . it ' s when there ' s nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway . you get it ?

the sooner the better . something ' s wrong here . no one has seen or knows anything about <person> . he ' s been gone too long to have gotten lost .
<person> . i ' ll talk to <person> and see what i can find out .
<person> , there were many reasons why you and i .
i ' d call them excuses . and the first excuse on both our lists was our `` sense of duty . `` we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else . and you know what ? it ' s not .
<person> . <continued_utterance> you got a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action .
with all we ' ve been through , sometimes i ' m amazed we ' re in as good condition as we are , what with the rebellion and all .

it ' s constitootional , i reckon . like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he ' s too sane . believes in law and order .
what ' s wrong with law and order ?
it ' s nothin ' compared to what you could be makin ' on the big con . you ' re wastin ' your time workin ' street marks .
hey look . you think i ' m gon na run out on ya or somethin ' ? just cause we hit it big . <person> , i owe you everything . if you hadn ' t taught me con , i wouldn ' t know nothin ' .

i wouldn ' t tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend .
<person> , call a cop ! we ' ll arrest this kid for larceny !
<person> , when your band was playing at roseland -

i can ' t believe you . i mean , i feel like i got you into this mess .
no , i --

this can ' t happen . what are we gon na do ?
it ' s too late .

that ' s great . see ya later .
it ' s even stronger in him than it is in you .
<person> here . <person> , we didn ' t get your whole transmission .
to hell with fate .
i told you i was interested .
i got stones to sell , fat to chew and many different men to see about many different dogs , so if i am not rushing you , could you spit shine the top of your smoothie and move a little faster ?
it ' s that old familiar story , you help a timid little soul across a crowded street . she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money .
that ' s the trouble with you readers . you know all the plots . now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils .
what about camping ?

what he does with them - takes privacy . time , tools . he ' s in his <number> ' s or <number> ' s - he ' s got real physical strength , but combined with an older man ' s self-control . he ' s cautious , precise , never impulsive . this won ' t end in suicide , like they often do .

i ' m in a real bind here .
<person> , well it ' s hard , isn ' t it ?

well , it was perfectly harmless , i just said , uh , i said `` when you come out from under , your mind will be completely free . there ' s nothing binding it . nothing holding it back . you will be completely open . `` tom stops , thinking for a long moment .
and my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars .
for what cause ?
<person> . nice touch . it ' s the logo from `` you bet your life '' , right ?
good eye . not one club owner got it . they all ask me why i got <person> on my card .
you must have been in love , once .
<person> ' t <person> hate them ?
i wouldn ' t say encouraged .
well , he didn ' t say ' no ' , did he ?
this just reminded her of that scene in `` brian ' s song '' .
actually , he just proposed to her . those are tears of joy . <continued_utterance> prost .
every word of it .
then you ' re smarter than most .
maybe someday . i ' ll keep a lookout .

from my character .
<person> on with it then .
sometime after <number> : <number> a guy ' s gon na call here and give you the name of a horse . all you do is take this two grand across the street to <person> ' s place and bet it on that pony . there ' s nothin ' to it , but don ' t take too much time . we only have <number> or <number> minutes after you get the call .
it ' s funny . sometimes i forget . then it hits me , and i can ' t stop crying .
i try just to be happy i ' m still alive .
i don ' t think he ' s at dinner at <number> . <number> pm . if you said he was still at lunch i ' d believe you . incredible . the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth .
i guess .
come ? <person> -- there is no crayon equivalent .
he wanted to change positions and i said . `` let ' s just get it over with . ``
not quite . i envy the hairline .
a lifetime of violence will do that . my nose was broken four times . and my jaw . but so much is the same . the eyes , you recognize the eyes .
no ! i have to be at the hotel at seven am sharp !
we ' ll get you up .
<person> , well .
<person> . <person> . best of luck , kids .
that ' s funny . i thought we went to see a mel brooks movie .

what ' s the action around ?
<person> .
the police are here . i am with them . i am a police officer . i just want to talk to you . <continued_utterance> we know all about the hoax . we already took some of your friends downtown in the paddy wagon . <person> wagon ?
oh god , that ' s great !
are you okay ?
of course . no <person> . what do you want ? what ' s my life worth to you ?
nothing . and everything . this is deeper than money . <person> up . <person> is done . <person> is over . understand that . you are over . just shut the fuck up .
. don ' t whisper to me , <person> , it draws heat . what helo ?
. the assault helicopter . you ' ve got no backup , at the house . you ' ll be in there , alone , the first few minutes .
it can be arranged .
that was uncalled-for .
so , my friend . what can i do for ya ?
you can tell me what this is .
maybe if you ' d try thinking once in a while , you ' d get somewhere .
with who ?
i appreciate your concern , <person> , but i ' ve been itching to try out the argo .
<person> --
<person> went for you , right .
that was different .
she told us about one . the little sisters of the moonlight . in <person> .
all right . it ' s a beginning . <person> , nevada . <continued_utterance> <person> , find the bishop and tell him the situation . everyone else -- follow me .
was it a sudden quarrel ? had there been any trouble between you before ?
if it was a quarrel , how come you had the gun right there ?
i ' m thinking it ' s time to settle down . one woman . one house . you know . it ' s time .
uh-huh .
<person> ' t talk about things you know nothing about . he was in a dictatorship !
yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , i heard all about that .
i did not think so .
you ' re bothered by your performance on the <continued_utterance> there is no correct resolution .
when ?
at school . she fell for <person> just before we graduated . got pregnant , and . went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot <person> ' s dad used to own . <person> started spending more and more time at the spread eagle .
you knew about the squid not being normal . <person> went out there ?
<person> , why ?
<person> .
<person> , she ' s a fucking waitress in buellton . how would that ever work ?
darling , i don ' t care - really i don ' t . <person> ' d had a secret crush on me for years , but nothing we do is his business -
but he could be reporting back to your brother , couldn ' t he ?
is that a goose ?
you can take it now if you like .
then explain it to me .
<person> ?
now this is a place of many wonders . see those guys in line over there ? <continued_utterance> we call them `` <person> '' . they all have season passes , and do little more than ride the wave all day long . some of them get pretty good . <continued_utterance> that ' s where they hang out when they ' re not riding the wave . <person> ' t get too close to them .
no ?
<person> .
he died on the train .
well . since i never told your folks , i guess i ' m lying to ' em , too . but you don ' t hear me complaining about it .
i ' m in awe . of your strength .
you just said a hundred .
<person> , but i want blood and gore .
are you ? <continued_utterance> it ' s getting cold .
you think i ' d really drink that ?
<person> ' t open that now . it ' s warm .
come on , we ' re celebrating . i say we pop it .
sure you can , if you know how the system works , and where the cracks are . it ' s amazing what you can accomplish by mail . mr . <person> has a birth certificate , social security card , driver ' s license . they ever track those accounts , they ' ll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination .
<person> . did i say you were good ? you ' re rembrandt .
as you wish .
this bickering is pointless . <person> will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station is operational . we will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke .
do you have family here ?
no . my wife and kids are still in mexico .
oh , that ' s tasty .
<number> % <person> . <person> vineyard . they don ' t even make it anymore .
so baby , you ' re rich . .
well , my mother is , sort of . not really .
what else . ? let ' s see . you have complete freedom .
to do what ?
yes sir .
<person> lad .
can i get you something else ? i mean , you shouldn ' t leave without getting something for free .
no thanks . why ruin a perfect night .
where ?
pittsburgh .
<person> , this is the best birthday ever .
i know i ' m no spring chicken , i figure i only got another <number> - <number> years in me . tops . but how ' bout we figure out a way to make this work .
maybe i should just wear this and a business suit and go as myself .
speaking of monsters -- i got an email from big . <continued_utterance> `` i don ' t know what to say . `` ah . then don ' t send an email .
<person> and misleading . why do you think he takes their skins , <person> ? thrill me with your wisdom .
it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies .
what ! what kind of pathetic line is that ?
we ' re gon na pass the street . <continued_utterance> you coming in ?
yes , some of it is speakable .
`` it is my lady , o it is my love ! o that she knew she were ! ''
praetor , we ' ve come to romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance . if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation , i suggest you do so now . <person> continues to stare at <person> . it is strangely seductive . <person> disquieting in its intensity . <person> handles it with grace , her level gaze never leaving his .
on the world i come from there ' s no light . no sun . beauty isn ' t important . i see now there ' s a world elsewhere .
well , i don ' t trust him , either . but he is my friend . besides , we ' ll soon be gone .
and then you ' re as good as gone , aren ' t you ?
sounds like a virus .
no father , they ' re edgy . on alert . like they act when they smell a predator around . peeing on themselves and everything . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ?
oh , <person> . it ' s not even noon .
it ' s almost two o ' clock .
the others , sir ?
beth and <person> ?
now ? i don ' t think so . but i ' ve met him , of course , and we ' ve chatted and i know about you and <person> and <person> and what an unreliable rat you are . <person> said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r .
i ' ve left <person> , meredith . and <person> . so the rat ' s here now , in rome .
no !
<person> , we must ! we must repair the damage . <person> will wait ; she ' s not going anywhere .
well , see what you can do with him . i ' ll be right back .
just you reconsider playing that message for him . <continued_utterance> no , i don ' t think he likes you at all . <continued_utterance> no , i don ' t like you either .
excuse me ?
oh . <person> , i ' m so unworthy . i want to take my final vows , i would do it tomorrow , but <person> won ' t let me !
i like grumpy old cusses -- hope to live long enough to be one .
<person> ?
<person> answer , <person> . <person> again .
all right . you want the truth . the vulcans . are highly intelligent aliens .
aye , sir .
we ' ll be going to warp speed --
not me . no , <person> . not here . maybe it is late . <continued_utterance> look , the truth is , yes , i had a great time , and i ' d like to kiss you , but if we do kiss , then we ' ll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch , then we ' ll kiss in the bedroom , and once you ' re in the bedroom -- well , the thing is , i always rush it . and this time i feel like maybe i should wait . maybe we should let it build naturally and grow , instead of just immediately spending the night together .
i want to spend the night together .
you okay ?
take it easy . <person> ' t force it . how ' s it feel ?
he ' ll probably cough it up .
do you think he ' ll be alright ?
it ' s wednesday night . she ' s at my house . i ' ll talk to her .
i ' ll call from work . we can have a conference call .
you have to what ?
it ' s a formality . any case of damage to city prop . you hit the control box of the new stop light , and . they ' ll , uh , these things happen , i hope you ' re alright , and that you ' re feeling .
thank you . i can ' t imagine what it is .
it ' s a sack-tent !
why are you so upset ? is there anything missing ?
who said you could ? who asked you to ?
here you go . you ' re a <person> ' s girl now . <person> will check you out .
i won ' t let the fat kid down .
how could i be so stupid ? he ' s nowhere in sight . blast it !
<person> me , sir , but couldn ' t we go after him ?
sometimes .
he ' s got a lot on his mind besides <person> . his wife , bella , is real sick . comatose . i ' m tellin ' you about it now , ' cause he may never . <continued_utterance> you ' re goin ' in the field , so you got ta have full kit . take this - it ' s my own . <continued_utterance> wear it , don ' t ever leave it in your purse . <person> fire it whenever you get the chance . and do your exercises .
in santa ynez . and i agree with you about <person> .
oh yeah ? we ' re just over in buellton . <person> .
<person> off the winter blues . come celebrate the spring .
i can ' t . i ' m kind of on one with my writing . <continued_utterance> can we do it soon though ? i ' d really like to ; just not right now . he nods at her in disbelief .
hey . this is my business . do i tell you your business .
<person> . <person> ' s just see if a mugger gets me .
those of us who have parents , know that they have rules because they care !
you sure you wan na go there ?
hey !
<person> !
if you didn ' t want me chasing him , you shouldn ' t have taken me to that funeral home . <continued_utterance> <person> is still the key , i know he is . whatever he told me about <person> is just as good now as it was before .
or just as worthless . but i want you in memphis , close to him . maybe when he gets tired of toying with <person> , he ' ll talk to you again . there ' s a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip .
<person> , you remember <person> ? <person> and i are a flight team now .
best in the fleet !
well , yeah , that .
i want you to go see my cousin <person> . <person> sure there ' s nothing wrong . just tell her about the headaches , that ' s all she needs to know , you don ' t have to bring up the other stuff .
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with <continued_utterance> i ' m curious . the d- <number> that was refitted into the deceased ' s well . was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant ' s ?
i believe so .
nice place you got here .
you from out of town . ?
but it ' s the only way they ' ll let me stay .
take it easy . you ' ll be all right .
that ' s it . <person> joyce haines .
<person> ' s not talk about it any more .
i want to give you a chance . it is up to you .
i want to give you a chance . is up to you .
<person> behind . ?
when the enterprise-b beamed us off the lakul , we were partially in the nexus . the transporters locked on to us . but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind .
why in the world would she t .
you took a fishing trip with the boys .
<person> is calling .
who ?
<person> . i figured just stick it in the bank , but <person> said check with you first .
he was right . you don ' t want your money in a bank .
why me ? it ' s not my baby .
but people don ' t know that , <person> , do they ? it would make a pretty story , wouldn ' t it -- the senator ' s daughter involved with a married man who ' s about to become a father . <continued_utterance> keep your voice down .
where ' s mr maccarron ?
<person> . the police are amateurs . well , my boy , it ' s come to a pretty pass , hasn ' t it ?
as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds .
<person> .
what ?
her husband works a night shift or something , and he comes home , and i ' m on the floor with my cock in his wife ' s ass .
i don ' t have time for this .
this is our wedding and you ' re not taking it seriously .
the farpoint mission ? data , that was seven years ago .
i know . i just got it . it was very funny .
i take uh . uh . . . <person> . . .
uh-huh . . any thing else ?
ha ! my right hand hasn ' t seen my left hand for thirty years !
i ' ll do it , j . j . - don ' t get me wrong - in for a penny , in for a pound . i ' ll see it through , but stop beating me around the head .
well , she was already dead , darling , wasn ' t she , so i suppose -
i don ' t know why people say this country ' s civilised . it isn ' t . it ' s fucking primitive .
uh ? did he take those two new droids with him ?
i think so .
time for a change . keep your margins straight .
yes .
never heard of him . i was recuited by a man called <person> on one of the moons of bogden .
no ? i thought .
oh , yeah -- reckon a pretty poor one , tho ' -- still you ' d say him and <person> was friends .
anything ever happen to make you think they weren ' t ?
believe me , the man ' s gon na be real happy . <person> like we cleared over ten grand this week .
we cleared <number> here .
behind you .
<person> , you ' re on my dress .
the thing is , that ' s not me .
give me a little credit .
my brother <person> . my mother ' s going back in the hospital again .
no , sh- he stops himself . she looks at him .
i mean plain nothing .
well , i guess that ' s about as nothing as you can get . plain nothing . a beat .
i would do terrible things to get with <person> tonight . terrible things .
no shit . i ' d give my left foot to start dating <person> . she ' s killin ' me .
occasionally .
then c ' mon . follow me . the art ' s in the basement , you ' re going to get a privileged peek .
<person> . why ?
because you weren ' t wasting my time .
i liked the dog , for laughs .
but <person> i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . <person> love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?
well , with all due respect to your betazoid senses , i prefer to be alone right now .
<person> well . i suppose i could make out my weekly report to <person> without your input . `` admiral lusby . regarding the unusual behavior of jean-luc <person> : i find him increasingly irritable . remote . and uncooperative . i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to -- ''
then what ' s the matter ?
i ' m all right , ma . <person> ' t worry about me .
well , i ' ll be darned . and what does j . j . think he should do ?
go out with different girls !
<person> . just because i was the only one with the balls to stand up to them .

that ' s what she said .
where have i heard that name before ?
no .
not even of dying ?
well , then we got good news for th .

for one thing , start mingling with `` the commoners '' . you ' d be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are . <person> some friends outside that little group of yours . it ' s the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table . show some gratitude .
<person> . i ' ll work it .
at least i don ' t walk the streets like a skunk pussy . i don ' t screw and fuck with killers and junkies .
who ' s a killer ?
<person> !
oh , are you all right ?
you ' re not gon na break him with a $ <number> , <number> bet .
this is just a test . the big one comes later . be careful with that though , it ' s all i got .

so i guess that ' s it .
you ' re a wonderful writer , <person> . <person> ' t be discouraged .

<person> ' t you have used a toggle bolt ?
well , i am a dead man and buggered to boot . my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks , my company is playing the inn-yards of england , while <person> and the chamberlain ' s men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece , written for my theatre , by my writer , at my risk when you were green and grateful -
what piece ? <person> ?
well i don ' t .
what you gon na do with your man there ? you ' re always gon na have problems lifting a body in one piece . apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together .
and then , something did . <person> heine was found dead . with his head crushed .
yes , and then , what was there to call about ? everything was up in the air .
<person> ?

i hope she never knows .
there must be something .
well , he should clean up this city here . it ' s full of filth and scum . <person> and filth . it ' s like an open sewer . i can hardly take it .

<person> was very charismatic and outgoing . <person> was introverted . he never thrived like <person> . he was a very disturbed young man . <person> was <person> ' s world . <person> never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him . he changed . <person> began to intimidate me . he could be very menacing . he began imitating <person> at school and that lead to fights with other students . at sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away . a few days later the thunder bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire .
the police want you to sign this so they can exhume the body in <person> ' s grave and verify identity .

i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ?
yes , by <person> ! <person> knows nothing of rank or riverbank ! it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king , and their love should be minded by each , for love denied blights the soul we owe to <person> ! so tell my lady , <person>iam shakespeare waits for her in the garden !

i ' m hip .
i feel for you , <person> , you ' re going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important . what good is all your uncle ' s work if it ' s taken over by the empire ? . you know they ' re starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems . it won ' t be long before your uncle is merely a tenant , slaving for the greater glory of the empire .

hi , <person> . <person> . i don ' t think this is working out . i think you ' re great , but maybe we should just take some time off from each other . it ' s not you , really .
<person> ?
i think you can expect just about anything right now . people have done some wild things after having a heart attack . selling businesses , getting divorced , moving . some people say it saved their lives .
but most people go back to being themselves , right ? i ' ll go back to being me , won ' t i ?
nope , i couldn ' t care less .
i ' m sure you wouldn ' t care if he needed your help , right ?
so what ' s the damage . total ?
it depends on whether you consider these four a color other than green , brown or clear .
you ' d probably have to go somewhere to really look into it .
definitely .
<person> enough .
and i run him .
<person> , it was awful .
what about you ? what happened to you ?
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks didn ' t really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats , i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i ' m not insulting you .

what happened to us , exactly ?
did you send that <person> to table- top ?
i did .
<person> lady , we can ' t overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps . but i forbid you to drag it into the living room !
let ' s not fool ourselves . the police will say <person> wanted <person> out of the way so he could marry <person> . in a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband , and <person> had every motive .
you ' ll be up to your armpits in meatballs , i ' m flying them in from sweden .

we are waiting for a man carrying a case .
how much did ya lose ?

i ' m serious . i ' ve got a few ideas .

<person> good .
get out .
<person> , if you don ' t give it to me i ' m a dead man .
but you don ' t know yet , so your negativity ' s a bit premature , wouldn ' t you say ? <continued_utterance> or fuck those new york publishers . publish it yourself . i ' ll chip in . just get it out there , get it reviewed , get it in libraries . let the public decide . giving <person> a look that says <person> has no idea what he ' s <continued_utterance> <person> ' t come over the top . <person> still .
<person> up .

<person> to fly . forrester , the magnificent animal , is waiting . did the hospital call ? is my stepmonster dead yet ?
<person> , i ' d like to meet him .
it mostly makes me sad that it doesn ' t make you sad .
you want me to be sad that someone ' s taking me out to dinner ?
it could be worse .
well , i must admit , i ' ve met some very nice people . in california , the attitude ' s a little different . here , not everyone is out to prove something . <person> ' s like everyone just wants to have fun .
jolly good .
he ' s completely distracted . he ' s up and down to london all the time . the latest <person> ' s taking everything he ' s got .

the brooklyn bridge . <person> between both our places .
b . b . who ?
<person> . the big money jobs . they ' ll expect you to be certified . i can register you for the next seminar if you want .
<person> , the boy . we ' re on the verge of a farce , a real farce . as i see it , if <person> had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat . but since primarily he ' s wedded to his work , he ' s not going to be able to take it .
stop tinkering , pal - that horse radish won ' t jump a fence !

<person> at me , <person> ! do you feel the blood pumping inside you ? your hands , your eyes , your nature , are the same as mine . <person> deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you ' ve forgotten . it ' s the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it ' s the very thing that truly defines us . to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are . <continued_utterance> i know you as well as i know myself , <person> . there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be .

the blood just oozing out slowly towards the curb .
the boy had jumped from above .

<person> ?
nothing comes .
most interesting .
<person> , norman . four minutes .
i heard ! i heard !
this way . nothing to see . <person> on .

you mean they haven ' t told you yet ?
told me what ?
<person> , you ' re enjoying this .

that ' s not sayin ' much .
it ' s the one thing that stands between me and the jungle .
<person> , i know what you mean . it ' s a long drive up here . where ' re you staying ?
the windmill .
wait a minute --
i said back away .
why not ? good foremen don ' t grow on bushes .

you said `` did . `` is he dead ?
oh . i mis-spoke . no , he ' s not dead . you know him ? piper nods . <continued_utterance> he ever talk about this ? a circle with a slash through it ?
there are pictures . <continued_utterance> dr . <person> , one of the authors of the book --
<person> ?
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor . how did that happen to a non-party member ?
i received a telegram from <person> informing me that he had made me a privy councillor . i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse . after the dreadful events of november <number> , the violent attacks on the jews , i stopped using the title .
you wanted by the law or somethin ' ?

he ' s doing extremely well .
what happened ?
<person> stood me up .
is that something you believe in , <person> ? evil ?
as a citizen of the world , it ' s hard not to . <person> ' t you say ? evil is all around us , i think - a part of the natural order of things . <person> gravity . <person> wind . a vast black wave , corrupting everything it touches . a virus invades a cell , causing it to dysfunction . perfectly logical . but did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus , something capable of using it to mutate so powerfully ? mackelway pauses , considering that . <continued_utterance> just because something ' s invisible to us doesn ' t mean it doesn ' t exist . <continued_utterance> have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark ?
from what ?
did he have any particular problems that you knew of ? financial pressures . run-ins with the law .
that ' s a bit strong isn ' t it ?
you wouldn ' t have a problem if it was a person .
<person> ' em . then show the results to everybody around who was selling outdoor goods two years ago . you have his initials ; mrc , inside the wetsuit . the long hair is distinctive , someone may recognize him . it ' s a semi-long shot .

we ' ve been partners a long time now , haven ' t we <person> ?
i started to get serious about seven years ago .

c ' mon , let ' s go ! on the bounce !
i ' m getting to like it here .

i ' l l see what i can do .
he can ' t know that it ' s you <person> . we do too much business together . you ' re gon na have to get someone else to hit him and there is no way it can relate to us . you understand ?
it ' s ten flights up .
ten flights down .
<person> ? i guess we ' re gettin ' to be friends , ain ' t we ?
i suppose we are .
mrnmm , yeah . but not really . it shifts around a lot . <person> you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father . and some other stuff happens , some parallel narrative , and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a robbe-grillet mystery -- you know , with no real resolution .
<person> . <person> , i think it ' s amazing you ' re getting it published . really . i know how hard it is . just to write it even .
ghosts .
you see ghosts , <person> ?
how much sleep ?
how long can you go without sleep ?
otherwise you ' d be fighting me off .
beating you away .
what ?
i mean we love each other as friends . but . <person> , you were sitting on all these incredible feelings . all tied up in that box with my pictures in desperate need of a love affair . and me . well , i needed to break the alec habit . and it ' s only natural i would turn to you in my confusion . but this doesn ' t feel real . it feels manufactured .
no , no , i see .
that : in an act of .
. after his shift .
. his shift - yes .
but i speak english .
will you please do it my way ? you ' ll get into trouble if you don ' t . if anybody talks to you , tell them . i do not speak english .
you left spacedock without a tractor beam ?
it won ' t be installed until tuesday . <person> . try generating a subspace field around the ships . that might break them free .
but the point is <person> - well we know this - <person> loves <person> and he misses her and apparently he ' s come to his senses .
it ' s fantastic . i feel guilty . <person> doesn ' t understand this , but anytime <person> does something i feel guilty .
where ' s she go ?
probably found somebody nicer . kidding . you ' re great .
i checked the place out . there weren ' t no dicks in there .
you ' re a con man , and you blew it like a pimp . i didn ' t teach ya to be no pimp .
<person> down , baby . you got ta double down on an eleven .
i know , but .
you ' re very talented , <person> .
<person> was so damned ultimate . everyday life . there ' s no way to go ultimate . <continued_utterance> but if it all gets too much like just too fucking much . you can end your life at any moment .
i didn ' t come this far to bury a guy that ' s not my dad . he owes me .
back to plan a . the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been trapped by <person> my whole life . she walks over to her scooter , and mounts it . <continued_utterance> now he ' s the one who ' s locked up and i ' m the one who ' s free . if i got ta do this alone , i might as well start now . she revs up and peals out .
death storm . <person> wave cracks her steel hull amidships , one inch crack from starboard to port . men go in the water . <person> lost . after a week . <continued_utterance> they come to <person> , call off the search . he stands like a stone . then turns , sharp , the way he does . says only , ' he ' s alive . and i know where . '
<person> ' s a witch .
oh please .
shut the fuck up . <continued_utterance> well , that ' s what parenting is <continued_utterance> you ' ve turned her into you . and i may not get another chance . to turn her back .
<person> minutes . that ' s all i could give you . no mission to fulfill . just . the two of you .
why would you do that ?
and if she ' s not innocent . if she ' s , you know , `` quirky ? ''
if she ' s `` quirky '' we ' ll save <person> ' s life .
why ? because i don ' t like the way you toy with human lives ? - your contempt and malice ? because i won ' t be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it ' s crippled <person> . ? you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory . but to me , and thousands of others like me , you and your slimy scandal , your phony patriotics - to me , mr . <person> , you are a national disgrace !
<person> , i don ' t fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns . so suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day .
that girl who died on the way up . his girl ?
yeah .
<person> , will you just for once not make the reason you won ' t marry me your fucking career !
all right then , what will we do about your extra-curricular love life ?
come on where ? back to a one-room apartment that i can ' t pay for ? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not ?
if you love me , <person> .
i ' m sorry .
why , you whore !
i know , but he ' s got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off . he needs me for just one more season . i can ' t leave him now .
i feel for you , <person> , you ' re going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important . what good is all your uncle ' s work if it ' s taken over by the empire ? . you know they ' re starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems . it won ' t be long before your uncle is merely a tenant , slaving for the greater glory of the empire .
i ' m going in . will you be my wing-man ?
i ' ll be your winger .
stop that .

i ' m going to find you , rutledge .
retreating from the

`` <person> thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . <person>ly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ``
i ' m clarice starling , senator . fbi .
clarice starling . <person> ? would you come in here , please . ? <continued_utterance> <person> , you may know the deputy attorney general , mr . <person> . <person> , this is the trainee that <person> sent to <person> . she lied to him , pretending to have my authority , and thus jeopardized this entire investigation . now she has the further gall to invade my daughter ' s privacy , again without permission . if her little games have killed my baby .
i never thought so .
<person> wants to bury the dog with me . but i told her i ' d rather do it alone . <continued_utterance> some advice about the child ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t get down on her level , the way you do . she ' ll never respect you .
i know you do , sidney .
<person> ' t judge a situation where you don ' t know what ' s involved .
they ' re rooks .
i ' ve got an unhappy wife and a newly qualified vet discovering a forbidden world of physical love in a bird hide .
yes . it does .
i ' m sorry , mr . <person> , i don ' t think the jury heard that .
you ' re not yourself , <person> . you ' re tired . when you think things over , you ' ll see i ' m right . <person> -- <person> opens his door , turns on bruno .
i don ' t know you . i never saw you before . i never want to see you again .
you ' ll lose the signal !
<person> ' t let go .
<person> , mr . <person> , could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself , as a personal loan ?
could i ? <person> , last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley . so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch . this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax . now if <person> had been elected -
what ' s fun for you ? you want to go to the shooting range or the morgue ? <continued_utterance> i ' m sorry .
it ' s going to take a couple days to depose you and get a full statement . i thought you might enjoy a break before you have to .
if we find her we ' ll get in the papers .
oh my god .
it ' s a great city to stay up all night in . when ' s your birthday ?
february .
you said he was dead .
he is . but he was here . <continued_utterance> he spoke to me .
a bad one . it was the only book in there . <person> , come here , look at this .
no , thank you . i hate jellyfish . <continued_utterance> . when i was six , my younger brother and i -- we went swimming in the pacific . at my mother ' s beach house . we both felt stinging , and when we came out of the water , he was wearing jellyfish head to toe .
you are <continued_utterance> and you . love my kids . how fucking touching . <continued_utterance> they came out of my body !
see , i know that .
professional courtesy . <continued_utterance> is that . possible , <person> ? an agent can just be deleted ?
looks like it .
<person> ! you think we ' ll get there by midnight ?
<person> , we ' re gon na be up by five hundy by midnight . <person> , baby !
where will you sleep ?
the living room couch .
what happened ?
<person> and me was having a bit of an argument .
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?
she ' s counting on it . she ' s concerned for your safety , but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you . or a carnival .
and then i ' ll see you in new york --
<person> , okay .
kind of suits you . and i always did like the old one .
you did it on purpose , didn ' t you ?
you look handsome .
you look amazing .
got it .
one . two . <continued_utterance> three ! <continued_utterance> you didn ' t shoot !
it looks like we have a tie . this has never happened before , but i seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules . hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do !
reading from the rules , `` . in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition , the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden-death surf off . additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared . `` the `` <person> '' heat will begin in five minutes . <continued_utterance> you want to go first or second ?
i don ' t know what you ' re talking about , <person> .
the chemistry between us is palpable . you and i both know that .
<person> , <person> i think we should stop hanging out .
you ' re breaking up with me over the rabbit lady ? <continued_utterance> i don ' t know , the way you act , i didn ' t even think that you ' d care that much .
not worry me ? i ' m your partner .
there is a god .
i ' m almost afraid to . what did you bring me , contraband <person> --
more antiques for your collection -- cheers !
<person> said that ? <continued_utterance> you ' ve talked to <person> ?
i did .
no .
<person> . we never find out .
<person> this out . <person> this be cash or credit card ?
credit card .
when this is over , i owe you a drink .
<person> ale , captain . <person> ' s get to work . <person> out .
light-weight ! <continued_utterance> hey . me and you should go upstairs now . i really want to . tell you something .
uh . uh . uh . you could just tell me right here-
i see a card .
<person> good . <person> , very good .
you ran out on this relationship .
i didn ' t run out on anything . you ran out .
why does the asshole always get the girl ?
come on . or you ' ll miss that train .
they ' ll nail your ass for this .
if i had any feelings , i ' d worry about that . but , as you ' ve maintained , i do not .
you went out last night , didn ' t you , <person> ?
why do you say that ?
yes . but it wasn ' t really . it was just .
so what happened ?
that ' s horrible .
he would ' ve written so much more had he lived . they developed a method -- some software -- to determine what he would ' ve written had he lived to ten , twenty , thirty , etcetera .
oh , i don ' t know . maybe . he ' s very inexperienced .
you know , you ' re a fascinating young lady .
i ' m getting experience .
you watch yourself !
yeah , i ' m cool .
<person> on the ground . now ! spread your shit !
no . no . i am so proud of you .
all i want is someone to see me , someone to look at me with kindness . for me to be the most special person in the world to just one person .
<person> ' t you sometimes hate yourself ?
constantly . no , in all serious- ness , it ' s really good . it ' s fun writing again . i ' m happy here , honest i am .
that ' s where i ' m going . to see her .
she ' s in trouble ?
have they ever been busted ?
no .
it makes me feel better .
does she ever answer back ?
reasonably so . yes .
and you ' d hate to think you were common . my , wouldn ' t that sting ! well you ' re far from common , <person> . all you have is the fear of it . now please excuse me . good day .
does he stay with you here ?
no !
not your children . not your life .
yes . you got me there . that is mine .
<person> .
in college we tried to make my friend ' s <person> take a bong hit .
yes .
but i ' ve got to know whether he touched her - where he touched her - how he touched her - if they broke a sweat -- - what they said - who made the first move - how they left it -- if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future - what she wore - how he felt afterwards - whether anyone mentioned me . . whether they held hands when they left . the distinct sound of a door opening and closing from downstairs .
why not ?
i . i don ' t get along with people like that .
you shit ! i ' ll decide if i go or not . not you . i don ' t know what you do on your planet , but i didn ' t think that was very nice walking out on me like you did .
i don ' t want you to be hurt .
then i ' ll take it as a compliment .
i knew it ! i had a bet with <person> !
<person> to me . i feel that something terrible ' s going to happen . do i need to get off the train ? am i going to die ?
i ' m right here , okay ? <person> ' t be afraid .
feel some pressure in my chest . it ' s real tight .
can you show me where the pain is ? <continued_utterance> what were you doing at the onset of the pain ?
everyone knows what <person> was like . he probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you , like he did at the sun- up that night . <person> ' t that it ?
no , that wasn ' t it . and till i do what i got to do , i ain ' t surrenderin ' to anybody -- least of all to your pal here . if i got to be shot for knowing too much , it ain ' t going to be in the back , in a framed-up jail-break .

a mining colony ?

as a soldier .
`` brutal '' is such a subjective word . i mean , what ' s brutal to one person might be totally reasonable to another .
this just reminded her of that scene in `` brian ' s song '' .
cool .
the guy said that if you ' re careful they ' ll last a whole month . and these aren ' t stupid kiddie unicorns and shit . they ' re all based on classic biker designs .

<person> , so the problem is still the nun outfit , right ?
<person> and <person> . <person> .
i left the number of the restaurant i ' ll be at if there ' s any emergency .
without the glasses you ' re not even ugly . i don ' t need them because i never read . how do i look .
<person> . <person> .
i doubt that .
no , really . when i started my training , i was very homesick and very lonely . this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about . the problem was , the more i thought about my mom , the worse i felt . but i would feel better if i thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers .
that ' s good . judges like adopted indian boys . tell me more about the ottos .
they ' re smart . <person> to college . they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago .
<person> , that ' s great -- it just so happens though , that i met . <person> , and much to my delight , not only is she alive , but she ' s female . i thought i told you . <person> looks at <person> , very suspiciously . he looks back at her , and tries to smile , pretending that he is having a pleasant , and completely irrelevant conversation .
<person> had a picture . it checked out . it ' s her , <person> . she is the murderer .
uh , uh , negative . we had a reactor leak here now . give us a few minutes to lock it down . <person> leak . very dangerous .
who is this ? what ' s your operating number ?
who did they get for that ?
you are angry , aren ' t you , mrs . <person> ? that ' s why i ' m here . to give your anger a voice . to be your <continued_utterance> weapon against whoever caused that bus to go off the road .
we ' d both be arrested for murder ?
you ' re is much in it as i am . we planned it together . criss-cross .
that ' s terrible . you ' re the surfer king .

women love this movie .
they met at the empire state building , only they didn ' t .
what are your plans in new york ?
we ' re going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night .
they came into my house . my wife told them who i was -- how many times did i put it on the line , <person> -- ? how many times --
<person> --
you were going to figure this out !
my place !
the name ?
poitier . he ' s a young black man . or maybe <person> . i don ' t know the exact name -
he doesn ' t strut ; he ' s a drummer .
<person> good-looking , isn ' t he ? poppy you-tubed him and we both got quite hot and bothered . is that his car - the yellow porsche ?
error in front office .
<person> applesauce .
you sure she ' s dead ?
would you like to see her morgue photos ?
she ' s in trouble ?
yes . do you find there ' s something strange about this meat ?
you were attracted to him -
cut me out of that pathology ! you are on your own -
what happens to the <person> world after i leave it ?
i don ' t know . you can never know that because you ' re not there to observe it . maybe it vanishes . <continued_utterance> i should tell them you ' re okay .
<person> , you got my attention , but this is cutting off the circulation to my head , here . <person> ' you mind ? <continued_utterance> i thought we were friends .
no , see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another . you just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act . well i ' m out . i got a kid , i got rent , i got an ex- husband someplace who doesn ' t send me a dime of support . i ' m just trying to hold on here .
rock -- i ' m gon na tell you somethin ' i ain ' t never told anybody .

<person> , maybe i ' d better take my car --
wipe your feet ! <continued_utterance> you are not dressed properly .
<person> . it ' s good to see you . reunion night ! how lovely !
yes .
the killer knew right where she was .
what a nightmare .
my brother ' s number , but-
- the sort of brother who ' d go for a walk on the twenty million rupee question ?
all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?
come on , <person> .
ace of spades .
statistically speaking you should ' ve accidentally guessed right by know .
crowded . i had to move to new york just to get some room . and where ' d i wind up ? a one bedroom apartment with three roommates .
aside from the space issue . why ' d you move to new york ?
have you been out in those streets ? do you know what those kids are up against ? you should help them !
we are nuns . we seek solutions through prayer .
so , you really think he ' s hot ?
<person> ? no .
if i stay , i will say awful things to you that i might not even mean . you pick .
see ya .
<person> . they ever catch on , he ' s gon na wind up wearing a number himself .
i thought you had more faith in me than that .
if you don ' t mind my saying so , sir , i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you ' ve gotten him back to your workshop .
no , he ' s not going to try anything . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong with him now ?
no -- there !
over there !
get some food .
no sense of humor . <continued_utterance> and that ' s another thing . you could lighten up a bit , yourself . this severe routine is getting old . <person> once in a while .
i ' m going to show you why we insist on such precautions . on the afternoon of july <number> , <number> , he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary . his mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an ekg . when the nurse bent over him , he did this to her . <continued_utterance> the doctors managed to re-set her jaw , more or less , and save one of her eyes . his pulse never got over eighty-five , even when he ate her tongue . i keep him in here .
dr . chilton - if <person> feels you ' re his enemy - as you ' ve said - then maybe i ' ll have more luck by myself . what do you think ?
i ' m going to cook , <person> . i ' m going to cook beautifully .
hey . please . <continued_utterance> we both were not normal because we are angry and we act like we are angry with each other and we are not . i am not . i am glad to be with you . it feels comfortable to be with you . if i just left the job and never spoke with you it would have been sin . you understand ?
<person> in bed with them ? that would too much to wish for .
you ' re so confident .
yeah , so ?
it ' s fucking blood .
see your license , <person> ?
' course . is there a problem ?
you think i didn ' t get that ?
excuse him . he never learned how to turn the darn thing off .
no .
she could be the third musketeer .
they know she ' s here ! they ' re on their way !

and you ' d be the boss .

you are committing an act of war , archduke . i hope you are prepared for the consequences .
we build weapons , senator . that is our business ! of course we ' re prepared !
it ' s the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve outrun imperial starships , not the local bulk-cruisers , mind you . i ' m talking about the big corellian ships now . she ' s fast enough for you , old man . what ' s the cargo ?
only passengers . <person> , the boy , two droids , and no questions asked .
if what you say is true , you should stay in the republic and help <person> put things right .
the chancellor means well , <person> ' lady but he is incompetent . he has promised to cut the bureaucracy , but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever , no ? senator , the republic can not be fixed . it is time to start over . the democratic process in the republic is a sham , a shell game played on the voters . it will not be long before the cult of greed , called the republic , will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom .
you get me <person> with the delightful cheddar crunch , and i ' ll watch my fucking mouth !
<person> ! ! ! ! you need to be rehabilitated .

nothing . i don ' t know what i ' m talking about . <continued_utterance> will you sit down . get out of the damn wind . <continued_utterance> so you going to send her ?
i don ' t know . but it does not feel good . i think if she goes there it will be one of two things . either she will be odd . or she will make herself the same as them .
everything .
<person> .
yes , but . after the break-ups -- comes the hot make-up sex .
you want to answer ? go ahead , sweetie . open it up . <continued_utterance> say something .
believe me , he ' s our guy . he tossed his own wallet back on the train . only reason he ' d do that .
. is if he wanted us to think he died in the explosion . i know . <continued_utterance> we looked into his profile .
i never said i didn ' t .
<person> --
<person> fired .
<person> ? you just started .
i lied to <person> . i ' ll need some kind of peace offering . can i get the drawings from his cell ?
good idea . meantime , try to get a feel for <person> . her apartment , her friends . how he might ' ve stalked her . i ' m going to the other two clinics , <person> and ohio . <person> ' s the hardest part , starling . use your anger , don ' t let it keep you from thinking . just keep your eyes on catherine . we ' ve got less than <number> hours .
uh . had a slight weapons malfunction . but , uh , everything ' s perfectly all right now . we ' re fine . we ' re all fine here , now , thank you . how are you ?

yeah , i went to stanford . <person> history and baseball . did you go to school back in the dr ?
he thinks you ' re a very suspicious character . he doesn ' t trust anybody ! not even himself . <person> is eager to get out of the room , and <person> is maddeningly slow in his movements .
come on . <person> ' t forget your sleeping bag .
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation .
why ?
sure , big guy . whatever you say . it ' s your party . i ' m sorry i ' m in the way and dragging you down . maybe you ' d have a better time on your own . you take the car . i ' ll catch the train back .
no , see , i want both of us to get crazy . we should both be cutting loose . i mean , this is our last chance . this is our week ! it should be something we share .
<person> . i like your obnoxiousity .
and my use of the word `` obnoxiousity . ``
oh yeah ? how exciting . what ' s it called ?
do not sabotage me . if you want to be a lightweight , that ' s your call . but do not sabotage me .
it ' s a soporific .
what ' s that ?
no . that ' s <person> . <person> ' s older brother . he drowned in a terrible accident .
i ' m so sorry , <person> . how did he drown ?
oh ?
if it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food , this mince pie would do it .
<person> .
and besides , he ' s not all bad .
you tell me what to do , i ' ll do it .
. and i was just paying off my house in malibu . <person> and <person> push through the crowd . <continued_utterance> <person> , it ' s up to you , pal . sup to you .
i hope he doesn ' t get out his slides .
am i what they had in mind ?
and i was planning to hit the pentagon next week .
the pentagon ?
i was in vienna . i had with me an austrian chauffeur , <person> his name was , he spent time in the camps . we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage , scavenging for rotting food , butt ends , anything . i said , ' to think a million of these people came out to welcome <person> on the day he entered the city , a million of ' em , and now look at ' em . ' and <person> said , ' oh , not these people , major . these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics . ' you get the point , <person> ? the point is they ' re all full of shit .
<person> ' s in a different category .
it ' s okay to be scared .
<person> ? i ' m off-the-charts terrified . there ' s a pissed-off serial killer after me . i mean , what did i do to him ?
you know , i ' m pretty expensive .
i wouldn ' t worry about money .
that was three years ago after that first party !
<person> , <person> , all i know is i ' m an actor . all i have is my instinct . my intuition -- that ' s all i have . and you ' re asking me to go against it . and that ' s just wrong .
christ ! remember <person> ?

yeah . we did .
well . get going . you ' re still bleeding .
eh . yes .
do you have a baby ?
huh ?
i knew it ! you paid a homeless guy to get you in , didn ' t you ! the boys think a second .
<person> .
<person> is not trustworthy .
i could have you put under this train for this , errand boy .
so could <person> .
<person> ' t flatter yourself .
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable .
all right . all right . i ' m taking a break at four o ' clock . if you ' re here then we ' ll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie .
oh , i appreciate that , <person> mam . i ' ll be here at four o ' clock exactly . and . ah . <person> .
<person> . you ' re hardly in a position to accuse me of lying .
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore - or starting to . tell me the rest now .
three months .

no . it didn ' t .
i worked vice , <person> . <person> . and i saw every known depravity . i was lost , mace . in outer darkness . then i busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker . when i met <person> she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank . another lost soul .
here ' s your cashier ' s check , sir . <person> there be anything else ?
please . would you add this to your outgoing mail ?
what ' s a ditty again ?
it ' s like a song .
he looks down on hunsecker , leans over the table . <continued_utterance> you ' re blind , mr . <person> . this is a crossroads for me . i won ' t get <person> . not for a life-time pass to the polo grounds . not if you serve me <person> on a plate .
<person> , i told you -
i dunno . that little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he ' s out there waitin ' around a corner with some friends .
he won ' t know you ' re carryin ' it .
to who ? <person> ? nothing . nothing that <person> doesn ' t already know .
what does <person> already know ?
no ! i have to get there .

yes , but they don ' t come no more this time of year .
<person> ! come in a minute , dear . <continued_utterance> <person> , you ' re very much in my thoughts today .
that ' s the one i didn ' t do . mrs . <person> sprained her wrist . <person> .
so you didn ' t do the one <person> told yer to do , and you did one he don ' t know yer did !

but , please , <person> , please - one step at a time ! i was born only yesterday ! .
i told your brother i couldn ' t be his accomplice . i can ' t be yours either , <person> , and encourage him to go on pulverizing you . i know what type - he ' s my old man all over again ! <person> , pathetically despairing , fingers the handle of her coffee cup , which she has not touched . the coat slips from her shoulders .

you seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?

you don ' t have to wait
days .
it is not . get out .
i ' m sorry , and i ' m sorry you lost your friend , and i don ' t think red is the right color .
you think someone else caused the accident ?
mrs . <person> , there is no such thing as an accident . the word doesn ' t mean anything to me . as far as i ' m concerned , somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner . some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement . they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference . that ' s what ' s done , mrs . <person> . i ' ve seen it happen so many times before .
i ' d like you to switch to the day shift , <person> . to be home for dinner . <person> insists that t . j . be home for dinner . that ' s why he ' s on the morning shift .
well , t . j . ' s . seniority . and all . i ' ll talk to garber about it .
i was in space for a long time . then a ship belonging to the `` talosians '' picked me up . they asked me where i came from . i told them people called the `` pakleds '' took me from my homeworld . they are fat . <person> groans . time passes . <continued_utterance> then i opened my eyes and saw you .

you know when girls grow into women ?
you ' re like some crazy man- you ' re obsessed .
she is my destiny , <person> .
<person> , come on .
you mother fucker .
she . uh .
she seeing another fella . ? . just between us . off-the- record , son . <continued_utterance> . i was young once , too .
cyborgs don ' t feel pain . i do . <person> ' t . do that . again .
just let me go .
i thought you ' d missed the train .
<person> drove me back in his car .
here we go .
thanks .
yes . acknowledge , <person> .
end of line .
<person> . they ' re still under the impression that we have him .
do we ? have him ?
thank you .
i probably won ' t see you again until the trial . if there is a trial .
what do you want with the pentagon ?
the same thing i want with the kremlin . i ' m bored with corporations . with the information i can access , i can run things <number> to <number> times better than any human .
<person> ' s working another warrant --
you don ' t understand , they ' re pros ! from the age of twelve they ' ve been dodging people like you , people better than you .
calm down .
we could have been killed .
jump .
but . won ' t you be de-rezzed ?
all right . <continued_utterance> but at the first sign of trouble , i ' m going to deactivate it . agreed ?
agreed .

i think he ' d go higher .
go you huskies .
you said it .
i look stupid . i look stupid , don ' t i ? i look like i ' m trying too hard . i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i ' d look like i just got a haircut .
this is a good letter , dad .
why ? <continued_utterance> you can ' t do it alone , ya know . it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make ' em look good .
we ' ll get by without ' em .
it ' s just not true .
<person> . <person> . over <number> ?
could you write in plenty of back- ground action , so they ' ll need an extra assistant director ?
shut up , <person> . now if we could sit down for two weeks and get a story .
<person> . it was magic .
<person> .
right . in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for <person> and the new driver will take . . this part . when you get to <person> , ask the driver , ' <person> , please ' .
' <person> , please . i do not speak english . ' what is hitchhike ?
no .
what about him ?
she found me ? what does that mean ? she stops . not wanting to go on . <continued_utterance> <person> , christina , are you going to spit it out ?
according to the notice , you were killed in action two months ago . the world stops .
she ' s got to identify him .
why ?
how will he do that ?
well , mr . <person> is representing several families . the ottos , the walkers , us , and i think a couple more . mr . <person> is suing the town for negligence . he ' s sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right . he ' s a very smart man .
that ' s what i told them .
<person> .
she ' s rich .
<person> ?
tylenol yes . .
hi . i ' m <person> , <person> ' s second assistant .
<person> me to see it ?
<person> you to see it ? <person> , they think you might have murdered someone ! you stole money ! <number> flan appears , needing help with his studs .
you mean , he quit on him ?
he was shot -- in the back -- with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got <person> .
well , i ' ll tell him , but i doubt that he thinks of it that way .
i doubt that you doubt that . <person> , you may like it . think of it this way -- he ' s not threatening , won ' t get your number , you get to run the show . you might have a hell of a time . over , we hear , ding dong .
it is the future you see .
<person> ? will they die ?
no , i didn ' t . what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum .
<person> , conundrum .
. in what way was that ?
. but i was trying to help .
that ' s an outrageous lie !
you sure you didn ' t call one of your close buddies and say , god in heaven , did you see what that guy von der <person> wrote about me ? the greatest conductor on earth . i want him out the way . he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music . send him to stalingrad . <person> ' t that what you did ? you don ' t like criticism , do you , <person> ? you surely didn ' t like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you . are you saying the name von der <person> was never mentioned in your talks with <person> ?
they ' re like baby toes .
it ' s not fair . i have to hide every erection i get .
well <person> and i are just friends now , and that ' s no reason not to wear mascara .
or blush . you look pale .
i do not get cold .

the regency , what ' s that ?
<person> , sorry . are you <person> ?
not on purpose . i guess some people call me <person> .
<person> gave me reason to live once you left . the flowers defined me .
your mother and <person> took you away . i tried for years to find you . i didn ' t leave you .
what the fuck are you going about .
and then you come to my house and you threaten me . <continued_utterance> . shooting off your fucking mouth , telling me what you ' re gon na do to <person> . telling me how you ' re gon na take him down .
but there ' s got ta be something you can do !
there ' s nothin ' i can do about it , kid . i ' m in full power . i ' m going to have to shut down . but they ' re not going to get me without a fight !
it ' s our friend the boy detective .
<person> ?
<person> .
that ' s better , mrs . <person> . but mrs . <person> is in a dreadful hurry . <person> could take . let ' s see . ten to twelve weeks , if poor mr . <person> is to die from natural causes .

<person> , just for one drink .
thank you for your time .

<person> , perhaps you are correct .
i am ?
who killed your patient ?
oh , a very naughty boy . someone you and <person> are most anxious to meet .
now you ' ve testified that the deceased was a heavy man , and hard to bring out of the net . <continued_utterance> is it possible his head struck the transom , or the stern gunnel , or the net roller , as you were bringing him in ?
i don ' t think so .
a universe of sensation is waiting for you . don ' t you want to explore it . with me ?
yes .
a diplomatic mission . we ' ve been invited , believe it or not . seems there ' s been some kind of internal political shakeup . the new praetor , someone called <person> , has requested a federation envoy .

<person> . <person> , this is dr . silber- man . i ' d like you to tell him everything <person> said to you . do you feel up to it ?

why am i doing this ?
for fun , baby .
<person> ? it ' s not a system i ' m familiar with . let me see . <continued_utterance> are you sure you have the right co-ordinates ?

what was it that made you know ?
i don ' t think i could really describe it .
some people probably thought <person> was bad clear through .
people . are a cynical lot .
sex killers act alone . so there ' s no information on the street , which is how cases get made . cops know they ' ll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene . <continued_utterance> and anyway , nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker . they ' re roadkill . <continued_utterance> see , it ' s all about what they see walking in . a dead hooker , handcuffs , penetration . they ' ll see a trick gone wrong . <person> kill . the kind you never solve .
but that doesn ' t add , does it .
i ' m fine .
where ' s the grey suitcase ?
<number> people .

yes , sir .
i see . well , shall we start with the engine room ?
on the cushion right next to you .
what was it like ? at the game , i mean , how did you know about <person> ?

<person> will be meeting a very sticky end . and it ' s one murder i ' m really looking forward to .
how could you ?
<person> said he thinks <person> should be destroyed .
that ' s ludicrous . this is contact . we have found god . the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth . so how will we describe it , if we choose to describe it at all ?
weapons of ass destruction ' s out then .
i could tell my parents i ' m doing a project on rome and i have to research orgies .

<person> ' t you give me orders , <person> ! i ' m a senator of the galactic republic . you have no authority to contain me , restrain me , or direct me ! you remember your place , young man . now you can come along and protect me or stay here . it ' s up to you .

<person> . when i was little , i wanted to eat some cherries from a tree . it wasn ' t our tree , and there was a fence to keep us kids away . <continued_utterance> so i climbed up the fence to knock down some cherries with a stick , but i when i took my first swing -- whoosh . i fell . there was a lot of blood . <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .

what ? you can ' t take the money and run now . you ' re on the edge of history , kid !
i ' d almost believe that . but i was behind the first aid station when you said the `` princess '' line . this park exists because the kids here work hard . they need to be treated fairly . they need to see you are just another lifeguard .
but i ' m not just another lifeguard .
open up in there !
oh , no !
to what . sleep ? if this was small enough to be helped by some little apology , i would be a fool to bring it up . i need to say more no matter what the result . i need to be impolite . you leave someone else ' s child alone . it ' s simple , no ? it is too easy for children to feel contradictions . it encourages questioning their parents . and that makes them less safe . your wife takes her for rides and changes her hair . you give her money . here . <person> back the money ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <continued_utterance> i did not mean to be angry to you - only emotional .
what about hypocritical ?
<person> . <person> .

we are all hurtling toward death . <continued_utterance> yet here we are , for the moment , alive . each of us knowing we will die ; each of us secretly believing we won ' t .
these guys all work at the alley , too . this is <person> , susan , <person> , <person> , <person>athan , and <person> . everyone welcomes theo and sheila .

i was wondering if anyone knew his name .
you take care with boys , jody . you know what can happen .
what can happen ? what can ever , ever happen in a place like this ?
commissioner strickland .
sure . whatever . <person> , since you shitcanned my career , i don ' t even have to call you sir . one of life ' s small pleasures .
i ' m wondering if <person> is responding to the underlying hostility that exists between <person> and mrs . <person> .
of course she ' s responding to it . you think it ' s easy for any of us ? you think it ' s easy for <person> to watch her kids being looked after by someone who has half the experience she does ? of course she ' s going to be hostile , irrational , and defensive .
that ' s possible . he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion .
you must remember him , <person> ' <person> . he watched over you during the blockade conflict .
you must be imagining things .
and i hate him . he thinks i ought to catch the eight-five bus every morning , punch a timeclock and work my way up selling paint or something .
really ?
no . but it hurts like a mother .
-- we are not sure of that . we are not sure we aren ' t all hallucinating .
if <person> is beyond our comprehension , and she -- -- is here for reasons that can ' t be understood , isn ' t <person> here ?
did you hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into gold ?

i ' ve stabilized him for now . but he ' s in a coma and he ' s going to need radiometric therapy . i want to take him to the ship .
hub . i think we ' re all eager to give up our weekends on this . it just occurs to me , has anybody even committed a crime here ? i mean , assault with a deadly color ?
here ' s what i don ' t like . they know explosives . they know our response time . they put in a call and walk .
<person> ' t you see it ? it ' s a picture of the creature .
the creature ?
<person> .
<person> rate .
no . you think i ' m a hero . i ' m no hero . i ' m nice to people where it pays me to be . i got ta do it too much on the outside , so don ' t expect me to kow-tow in my own office . i ' m in a bind right now with <person> so -- every dog has his day ! lock up and leave the key . <continued_utterance> if that ' s for me , tear it up !

<person> . i . i don ' t do this sort of thing .
i ' ve got cash . <continued_utterance> <person> .

i don ' t know , but i wasn ' t gon na wait around for them to throw me out . <continued_utterance> i ' m just saying .
whatever , man , you wouldn ' t be saying that shit if you made it .
i suppose it ' s in its usage .
how about `` <person> you ' re a douche bag for kissing <person> ? ''
<person> continues:
are you listening ?
it wouldn ' t matter . with <person> ' s testimony , i can get a new trial .
that ' s assuming <person> is even still there . chances are excellent he ' d be released by now . excellent .

we were expecting more from you .
i can give you more . let me think for a second . <continued_utterance> the freight car blows up from the fire . it spews gas , or what could be gas -- it might be chlorine , so they can ' t take any chances . <continued_utterance> so they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of new york city . and maybe that ' s part of the terrorists ' plan , right ? <continued_utterance> so . so who benefits from that ? what ' s vulnerable ? what ' s down there in lower manhattan ? <continued_utterance> <person> .

-- a slice of pizza --
general <person> , years ago you served my father in the clone wars . now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the empire . i regret that i am unable to present my father ' s request to you in person , but my ship has fallen under attack and i ' m afraid my mission to bring you to <person> has failed . i have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory systems of this r <number> unit . my father will know how to retrieve it . you must see this droid safely delivered to him on <person> . this is our most desperate hour . help me , obi-wan <person> , you ' re my only hope .

i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is .
i see an old man , set in his ways , afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a <person> regulation to tell him what to do .
<person> up ! <person> up ! <person> up ! what ' s the matter with you , man ? shut up !
why are you so hostile ? i know you ' re frustrated with your life right now , but you can choose not to be so hostile . here .
it ' s a big deal . every girl wants to date you . every guy wants to be you . special privileges . we all wear standard uniforms . the <person> gets to be creative . you ever see the cowboy hat <person> wears ?
it shouldn ' t be that hard . how good could this <person> be ?
i recommend preserving it .
really ?
we don ' t think that ' s necessarily bad . at least it ' s a point of contact .
not necessarily bad ! if they knew we were here why didn ' t they let us know they were coming ?
this r <number> unit of your seems a bit beat up . do you want a new one ?
not on your life ! that little droid and i have been through a lot together . you okay , <person> ?
if i could be of any help .

i mean , i ' m going back .
that must mean you love it then , huh ?
i bet <person> is in a deep grave with square corners like <person> and ford . <person> looks like all the victims . maybe he ' s subconsciously killing himself .
we ' ll take that with us .
amen to that . the supermarket ' s full of assholes .
take my advice , don ' t buy any .
how ' s she doing with <person> ?

are you saying the president is prepared to take the necessary steps . ?
<person> ? okay ! pompoms snap to thighs and the cheer begins . <person> is effortless as she glides , jumps and smiles through it - clearly better than <person> .
but they have to , y ' know , spread the talent around , so i ' ve been on the b squad for four years .
if it is an alien spacecraft --

it ' s my fault . i should have come earlier .
if you want t ' buy them seven acres . <person> ' s the only fella can sell ' em .
i was a soldier . then . but now ? <continued_utterance> after death ?
it was the only way . you couldn ' t have a body and be sent back into the source code . <continued_utterance> what is the status of your mission ?

because you have to have technique .
that ' s not what ' s going on .
why did you tell me you had to work tonight ? why did you lie ?
you been running around ? <continued_utterance> it makes you feel better ? <continued_utterance> i like to run around . it ' s good exercise . you want to ask me questions now ? <continued_utterance> you want to be a lance corporal in company m , <number> rd battalion , <number> th <person> ? we ' re being dispatched to the quang nam province .
maybe later .
i know . <person> ' s gon na get the rainman suite . <person> , baby . we ' re going to <person> !
<person> ! you think we ' ll get there by midnight ?
if that ' s the way you want it .
that ' s the way i want it .
well they work , i reckon they are really going to put the shits into em .
<person> now i am not concerned with putting the shits into em <person> , i am `` `` . concerned about taking the pain out of my ringing fucking ears . look what you did to poor <person> . <person> you alright ? <continued_utterance> are you alright ?
my ass is falling . it is .
what are you talking about ?
why are you here ?
to accept your surrender . i can clearly destroy you at any time . <person> your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship .
<person> . what an unexpected pleasure .
<person> , i want to talk to soran .
you ' ll think this is crazy , but all i want is to hold you . just once . and smell your hair .
you have to hear this , i can never touch you , ishmael . not once , not ever . there ' s no half- way . as much as i know it hurts you , you have to let this go .
nothing . nothing at all . just two little things . that woman over there in the corner . she ' s <person> ' s friend , and her name is <person> .
no shit .
i think we could tell if someone else was here .
we didn ' t all night .
i can ' t get involved ! i ' ve got work to do ! it ' s not that i like the empire . i hate it ! but there ' s nothing i can do about it right now . it ' s such a long way from here .
that ' s your uncle talking .
<person> ' t call me dumb !
i mean cute dumb . now bend over !
<person> , i didn ' t really want it anyway . i just wanted to order it .
can i get you something else ? i mean , you shouldn ' t leave without getting something for free .
<person> , let ' s go .
now , don ' t you forget this ! why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity !
that ' s right , i clearly said get him the <person> . so why did you get the volante ? ;
because they look the same .
what kind of guns do you guys use ? . <number> ' s ?
look , um , if you give me your name and address , we ' ll send you the information on how to apply .
for abandoning you .
`` for abandoning you to have anal sex with my homosexual lover <person> . ``
you think so ?
i know so !
that is wise . in any case , were i to invoke logic , logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few .
or the one .
<person> ' t be afraid . i ' d really like to hear it . <continued_utterance> please .
i am not a good singer .
if that ' s what feels right .
it does . <person> right .
quiet down will ya ! you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater !
i ' m sorry . i ' m quiet . <person> how quiet i am . you can barely hear me .
i . i decided to give it another ch .
i love your script .
yes sir !
get inside and get pictures , fifty bucks .
just don ' t get cocky . no one likes a dickhead . welcome to the team .
so , why do they call you <person> ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
he ' s not comin ' in . not to get bounced off a job anyway .
he had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house . made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops , but didn ' t hit nothin ' . <continued_utterance> this is <person> ' s job now , vince . if <person> wants to muscle in on it , that ' s his business . but he ' s breakin ' the rules and when <person> finds out about it , i can ' t feel sorry for what ' s gon na happen to him .
and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart ?
you ' re a real rascal , <person> . i ' d certainly dislike you if i didn ' t like you . you ' re an amusing boy , but there isn ' t a drop of respect in you for anything alive - you ' re too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck . not that i don ' t sometimes feel that you yearn for something better . <continued_utterance> i don ' t mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance , as long as j . j . doesn ' t know . but don ' t do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine . <person> doesn ' t like this ; but , on the other hand , he does want to look at the column . after only a momentary struggle , he picks the column off the spike and reads .
you must not go !
but <person> and <person> will die if i don ' t .

not much of a collection really . i haven ' t had the wallet for that , so i sort of live bottle to bottle . but i ' ve got a couple things i ' m saving . i guess the star would be a <number> <person> .

cos she loves <continued_utterance> there ' s going to come a moment . when she ' ll really need you to give that back . and you ' re just the girl that can do it .

my dad made me invite him .
<person> and <person> are two very untalented , unfunny actors from canada . their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage . now it appears they have a movie and i ' m positive it ' s not suitable for children !
well , it looks like i ' ll have to send a warning letter out to parents . i have to put a stop to this before more children see ' <person> and <person> ' .
oh , <person> would love that . no . i want him out . i like that house .
how long have you guys been there ?
he ' ll eat potroast and like it .

assistant insructor . you must be some kind of a hot stick .
only when i give you an order .
lieutenant , actually . <person> . i ' m the head of the resurrection protective force . and you are ?
jean-luc <person> .
captain , don ' t assume he ' s anything like you are . you should resist the urge to think you know him .
i not only know him , <person> , i am him . and he is me !
no , baby . <person> ' t get in a tizzy . it ' s just . you ' re so beautiful . you ' re like a <person> all by yourself . you don ' t need all that .
uh-huh .
so , do you like it there ?
mmmm . it ' s different .
well , it had sentimental value .

it ' s just tough to be sane .
<person> , she begged me . i had a short-range version of the destabilizer prototype , a miniature with a range of a few meters . she walked into it and disappeared . she was gone .
she ' ll come back .
then you are wrong .
<person> and politics , yeah , art and politics . <person> ' s look at that . you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich , played in countries the nazis had conquered . are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from <number> on wasn ' t a commercial for <person> and all he stood for ?

will you write that ?
i might just . <continued_utterance> i was part of her life again . i was a person .
we cleared the mayor . he read the article on you in newsweek and insisted we fly you up . the papers say two campers had a drunken fight and the loser lost his head .

and we know that , even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite , the lowest slug of humanity ! we know that deep down inside , you ' re probably even worse . and so you truly need our prayers .
`` embezzling '' is such an ugly word , <person> . no , actually i ' m trying to get a legal brief together .

i ' ve been here before -- this was all ukrainian area .
coming or going ?
i don ' t like disappointments , <person> . and do you know what disappoints me very much ?

<person> , right . <person> .
<person> ' s compromised . we ' re lucky to be alive , ma ' am .
<person> work , <person> <number> . you ' ll do .
you know about signs <person> ? not like the ones people write on . it ' s like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it . then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled . they ' re things that happen by chance or luck , but make you feel that someone ' s watching out for you .
i once had a bad dream and i couldn ' t wake up . i kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and i woke up . it was a picture of mom . she was smiling . it made me feel safe . you mean like that ?

i think that ' s the girl . they took her . the two , two men . they . . they gave her a shot .
a novice .
<person> , like a learner ' s permit , right ? when do you hit the big time ? you know , when do you take the final vows ? <continued_utterance> whoa ! <person> ! what ' s going on here ? what ' d i say ?

a lot of times , when somebody dies , it can be kind of , you know , messy . so , we go in and clean up all that left over mess . <person> sure that the area is clean and sanitary . <continued_utterance> people just don ' t understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids .
i ' m afraid you ' ll hurt him .
it ' s <person> , isn ' t it .
i ' m probably not interested in whatever you ' re selling .
i ' m not selling anything . your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife .
<person> . that is a difficult concept . it is not logical .
we learn by doing , lieutenant . <continued_utterance> you want my advice ?
you can still make a choice ! make the right one now !
i have no choices ! i can ' t fight what i am ! <continued_utterance> i ' ll show you my true nature . your nature . and as earth dies -- remember that i ' m forever <person> of <person> ! and my voice will echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory .
<person> .

you mean , do i like to take the offensive ? or hang back and wait .
i want them thrown in jail .
<person> , <person> . <continued_utterance> what ? get me the state police .
okay . i ' ll talk about it . your best friends get screwed over by their guys -- how can you not get distant ?
it ' s more than that -- lately , i haven ' t been feeling a connection to --
you ' re not really on this train .
i ' m taking someone ' s place . borrowing it . my name is <person> . i ' m a soldier . and i ' m being held prisoner . and this is the only way -- the only time and place i have -- to figure out how to escape .
<person> , malcolm .
<person> , sweetheart .
were we always explorers ? plcard no . i was the first <person> to leave <person> . it caused quite a stir , in fact . but i had spent my whole life . <continued_utterance> looking up at the stars .
yes .
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there . so he climbs up . to cut it down .
just as the freighter comes through ?
well , don ' t get all weepy-eyed abou .
<person> t ' tell . i was a wee help . b ' hind the scenes , doncha know . <person> working . jack sometimes . <person> is enough .

you go . in fact , use my clubs . they ' re brand new -- gift from <person> ' s dad . it ' s on me . oh , say , by the way , <person> and me were thinking we ' d all go to the hitching post tonight and sit at one of maya ' s tables , and she ' ll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
count me out .
when did he say it , norma ?
so he said it quite a few years ago . so what ? i never looked better in my life . do you know why ? because i ' ve never been as happy in my life .
god , i don ' t remember , i haven ' t had caffeine in almost eighteen hours , how am i supposed to-
in general , what was it ?
there ' s a bathroom upstairs .
the water tastes better in the kitchen .
la da da dalala .
i hate fuckin ' opera .
what key ?
found it under a pot .
<person> ' t that a little dangerous ?
<person> ' t worry yourself , true inter- dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical , but one day . maybe very near . maybe in the <number> st century .
you didn ' t get any , did you ? you ' re a homo .
just stop , okay ? make something up , and that ' s what happened . whatever you want . write my confession , and i ' ll sign it . just stop pushing me all the time ! i can ' t take it ! you ' re an infant ! this is all a big party for you , but not for me ! this is serious . and you -- just . leave me alone , okay ? you ' re fucking me up .
hey , alright . got something here for you , too . it just showed up tonight , don ' t know who left it .
<person> mail from some flounder ?

he ' s got a houseboat .
i hate boats .
okay .
<person> , since high school we ' ve been able to read each other . take advantage of it . the answer to the question is , '' absolutely not . `` now take a look and tell me if you believe me .
right . <person> is the whole <continued_utterance> <person> ' t
and you said . ?
a new comedy . by <person> !
and his ears .
dead people ?
ghosts .
their tracking us !
not this ship , sister .
<person> . <person> stuff , maybe ?
keep it out of sight and get it down to r and <person> monday , first thing .
well , it ' s the jack kennedy syndrome , huh ? you die young , you always look golden . <person> . the memory kind of burnishes the image , and .
come on , a wuss like me ? the stiff who wouldn ' t help her own daughter fight back ?
. that ' s what you ' re looking for . ?
. i . uhh .
right , sure , but what ' s the problem ? are they keeping you a prisoner here ? do they drug you ? did <person> like , kidnap your parents ? we can call the enquirer .
no , you don ' t understand -- i don ' t want to get out ! i want to get in ?
after we id , we bury the body . <person> and casket closed .
you tried to make it look like <person> trashed his place . <person> ' s underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .
hardly . i couldn ' t be less alone .
of course . <person> .
just a little friendly pool . no big deal . <person> make this more interesting .
i ' ve seen this <person> practice . his style is more longboard , and this is a shortboard wave , but he ' s still pretty good . i could lose you know .
we need to get in . it ' s bad out here .
i was thinking of calling it simulacrum . what do you think ?
a soldier !
there are words on his shoulder . <person> , the argentine sector , <person> , bolivia , shanghai
can you get my balloon ?
<person> ' t you afraid to be out in the open like this ?
i didn ' t do it for you . believe me . <continued_utterance> she already hates me . you ' ve seen to that .
you ' re not terribly good at taking care of h .
that ' s because men can be scum , your precious father excepted , may you live to find one like him , it is damn hard . <continued_utterance> now is that little prick still here , because if he is , i ' m gon na rip his fucking heart out !
no , his mother ' s always on time . <person> . <continued_utterance> and <person> says anger never , never

he ' s being thorough , that ' s all . i ' m learning about my son , <person> , now he ' s missing . i ' m learning a great deal about him . i hope you can fill in some more blanks for me . <person> has been good enough to do that , about <person> .
you see he is impossible .
<person> you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had . <person> ' t go <person> ! ! come ! look ! he starts to play his machines handles and buttons .
<person> writes a single gal column for the new york post .

he knows about my work on the planetary conjunction , doesn ' t he ?
bodd-ill a bee-ya .
bottle of beer .
please .
it ' s too late .
his real name is <person> . a former patient of mine , whose romantic attachments ran to , shall we say , the exotic . ? i didn ' t kill him , merely tucked him away . <person> much as i found him , in that ridiculous car , in his own garage , after he ' s missed three appointments . you ' d have him under `` missing person '' - which , in poor <person> ' s case , could hardly be more true .
if you didn ' t kill him , then who did ?
we ' re going to find our boys ! for god ' s sake <person> , you almost had them killed ! !
killed . they should only be so lucky . <person> wasn ' t even born in a hospital !

<person> . that ' s his name ? <person> ? is he french ?
what was your last stop ?
<person> ' s .
as i indicated , admiral , that thought had not occurred to me .
then you have something new to think about . <person> on .
there ' s one up near the entrance . who was he , <person> ? guy looks back sympathetically in <person> ' s direction , speaks without looking at the boatman .
<person> . <person> antony . a very clever fellow .
well , uh , i . gee . if . can i tell you tomorrow ?
you snooze , you lose . hiya <person> .
if i had known i was going to have company , he was right next to me . i think he heard me peeing ! i hate that , i am glad he ' s in jail . <continued_utterance> lieutenant garber says when i identify him , they ' re going to lock him up and throw away the key . <continued_utterance> i guess i ' m supposed to do it in the morning . identify him .
<person> , the better .
so you knew this when you wrote your report ?
at the time , i don ' t know , i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break .

i don ' t believe a single word you ' ve said .
thanks . <person> ' t go anywhere . i ' ll be right back .
you think she ' s really got a head- ache ?

<person> ? <continued_utterance> wha -- ?

<person> , i never cared for gregory .
you didn ' t ?

chickie , i ' ll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you . !
i hope that j . j . really likes <person> , that it isn ' t an act .
<person> , it ' s <person> on the coast .
we ' ll see you tuesday , then .
no . i was sobering up . i realized she wasn ' t worth it . i decided to let her have her quickie divorce .
<person> divorce indeed . a . <number> caliber divorce , wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots , isn ' t that what you mean ? and then you shot her lover !
you ' d better get to bed yourself .
i think i ' ll read a little .
<person> . and <person> ? can he start construction on the house again ? i ' ll be sending money every two weeks now .
we just paid him . he ' s coming next week .
you didn ' t lose me . you rejected me .
i ' m unrejecting you .
and i love poetry above all .
<person> ? <continued_utterance> my lord -- when you can not find your wife you had better look for her at the playhouse . <continued_utterance> but playwrights teach nothing about love , they make it pretty , they make it comical , or they make it lust . they can not make it true .
sure . but that costs extra .
were you here last night ?
i don ' t know . you get that gun from boris ?
got it . it wasn ' t exactly what i was expecting , mind . mean looking bastard though , that ' s for sure .
if you want to keep that money , all of it , just give it to your wife . <person> , the irs allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse . it ' s good up to sixty thousand dollars .
<person> , that ain ' t right ! tax free ?
she hasn ' t mentioned this .
she was afraid you ' d make a big deal out of it .
think you can trust me ?
the last time i seen <person> was the day he died -- in the pause <person> remains silent . <continued_utterance> -- ' twas in town -- he jus ' come out of the stage office . <person> to book passage to <person> but couldn ' t on account i had a full load . -- well , sir , he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says , `` read it . `` i looked it over and fer as i could see it was a paper from one of them chicago sportin ' firms , tellin ' how to manipulate trick playin ' cards .
not yet , ma . but i learned how to throw a knuckle curve .
a knuckle curve ? what ' s that ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> . a group of kids gather at the window .
it hasn ' t .
i can ' t wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills . whenever i try to visualise the force , those hills are what i see . <continued_utterance> i love <person> .
i ' ve turned professional . what can i do ?
sala . !
<person> never forgets . <person> ' t that right ?
oh , <person> can make an exception .
<person> didn ' t know . <person> ' t get a reading .
<person> spoken with <person> ?
i have dissolved the senate . <continued_utterance> right now , you ' re thinking this all sounds too good to be true ?
yes .
i think you need to sit down , man , something very next level was happening there , you should have seen your face .
she told me what she wants .
i ' m not being defensive .
you sound defensive .
uh . there ' s mom . and that ' s <person> . <continued_utterance> those are temporary .
<person> . and maybe a sweet . <continued_utterance> she needs to go outside .
she can ' t donate . you can ' t donate . <continued_utterance> forty-eight days . it ' s not been forty-eight days .
why are you acting like this ? why haven ' t you called me back .
you said that ? and what did he say ? did he say you could leave her ? did he say we ' d be happy ? <continued_utterance> what ?
you want me to go against a priest ? <person> excommunicated ? you think i ' m nuts ?
so what ' s your novel about ?
well , it ' s a little difficult to summarize . it begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke . kind of based on personal experience , but only loosely .
there ' s talk of that .
someplace where no one knows her . someplace strange and new .
he did okay .
i heard he caught poison ivy .
indian trouble --
wonder why the old lady ' s playin ' along ?
<person> ?
what honey ?
exactly . that ' s what ' s gon na be different this time . something strange happens , let it go . it ' s not my business . <person> . she says <person> in her sleep .
who ' s <person> ?
<person> cash ! <person> . here ' s everything i have on me , what do you say ? how about a rolex ?
i already got a real one . come on , it won ' t be too bad . it ' s not personal .
you like working in the laundry ?
no , sir . not especially .
you heard me . wan na make something out of it , private ?
not with an officer , no , sir . the m . i . doesn ' t mint stupid cap troopers .
<person> , i think the chip is working .
yes . i hate this ! it is revolting !
i live . in the same country . <continued_utterance> oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh .
. why do you think ?
<person> . and an actor .
i ' ll have to come see you sometime .
i understand .
sounds like your captain ' s going to get hell when he gets back home .
thank you .
thank you ! thank you ! thank you !
i don ' t quite recognize it , that ' s how i know i ' ve never had it before . <continued_utterance> so you don ' t sleep ?
i only need about four hours a night .
it ' s almost two o ' clock .
god , where is this day going . <person> could you come with me ?
why would his worry ? or my children ' s worry . or anyone ' s worry . help the sit .
<person> than later . you really need to .
stop that . how ' d he take it ?
he just took care of it for me ; he was an ace . elegant . said our fate was to be friends . . oh my god . he was breaking up with me . he ' s a genius .
please don ' t shout .
you don ' t feel a thing , do you ?
it says ' dear terrance , please don ' t ever tell my son that i licked your hairy balls . ' terrance and <person> laugh merrily .
oh , you fucking ball whore !
i could hear her moaning , right under the navajo chanting . <person> thing was downright tribal . what ' s she look like ?
you tell me .
maybe they ' ll catch up .
i have no doubt of it .
but of course , <person> . please follow me . <continued_utterance> this is . the taj mahal . <continued_utterance> the taj mahal was built by the emperor khurram for his wife <person> who was maximum beautiful woman in the whole world . when she died , the emperor decided to build this five star hotel for everyone who wanted to visit her tomb . but he died in- in fifteen eighty-seven , before any of the rooms were built . or the lifts . the swimming pool , however , as you can see was completed on schedule in top class fashion .
it says nothing of this in the guide book .
this isn ' t happening .
<person> ' plastic over her face . <person> thinkin ' , <person> .
is it chicken ?
i could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend . could have made a pork roast .
not likely . are the speeders ready ?
not yet . we ' re having some trouble adapting them to the cold .
no , sorry .

it is the truth . <continued_utterance> it would be strange if you didn ' t feel that way .
what do you want me to do for you , mr . <person> ?
well , it ' s hard to explain . i can only tell you from my own experience . soon after i joined the orchestra , we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven , the eroica . there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani . one particular crescendo . during the break , i asked how he wanted it played . he was studying his score . he didn ' t look up . he said , ' just watch me . ' so , of course , i did . i never stopped watching him . the moment came . and suddenly , he turned to me and our eyes were locked . there was something in his look that . that simply demanded the crescendo . i shall never forget his look . it was a moment of . of magic .
you ever seen <person> hitler ' s eyes when he was making a speech ? i ' ve seen ' em on films .

<person> , good .
<person> . you know him ? <continued_utterance> you ought to . <person> first baseman ever . but that ' s not why he ' s my favorite player . back when he first arrived , <number> , <number> , he was playing in the minors . <person> , arkansas . so the story goes , one day before a game , <person> stops into this diner for lunch . <person> ' t been here long , so he knew very little english . <person> ' t even notice the `` whites only '' sign hanging in the window . and <person> was <person> . i looked him up on google . i mean <person> like you . so he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big <person> and says , `` i ' m sorry , we don ' t serve colored people . `` <continued_utterance> so he leans close to the waitress , tells her in his best english , `` that ' s okay , i don ' t eat colored people . `` <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .

yes . fine .
and <person> ? <person> ' s <person> ?

you always know the right thing to say .
i am . grateful for what you have given me . but i still do not wish to be assimilated .
a universe of sensation is waiting for you . don ' t you want to explore it . with me ?
we are .
it ' s just the two of us now , <person> , as it should be . your ship and mine . you and me .

i just know a couple lines .
you really don ' t understand , do you ? when a girl comes over to your table and says , ' i think you ' re funny . ' it means you ' ve pretty much been given the keys to the city . <person> , this is big .
perhaps you ' ve confused me with someone who gives a shit . here ' s what ' s gon na happen , <person> . we ' ll end up going out with them tonight , maybe even home with them . well go out for two months . soon she ' ll move in , we ' ll be happy , she ' ll want more of a commitment . i ' ll be terrified and i ' ll do something to ruin it . just like i did with <person> .
not really . do you think you can get here on time if i put you on the floor as a waitress ?
i don ' t know . i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life .
oh , just . when i was a kid i was bored .
well , you must have been really bored .
the choices i made have led me here as well . this is the only home i have ever known . i can not foresee a reason for leaving .
you never know what ' s over the horizon , <person> . <person> too long you ' ll be offered a command of your own . <person> looks at him ; he has never really considered this .
meaning ?
they were waiting for the cameras .
she said that ? <person> ? <continued_utterance> well , then there ' s only one thing to do .

i don ' t have to listen to you ! you ' re not my mother .
<person> for that ! <continued_utterance> what i meant and perhaps i didn ' t say it well was you have a great mom . you don ' t need another one . but when you ' re at this house --
i ' m sorry , but , look , you know i hate rap , i mean i do . it ' s sort of violent and crude for my taste , not to mention just a tad misogynistic .
hey , a lot of people see rapping as poetry .
his kid never got a fishin ' license . <continued_utterance> what we wait fer ? she ' s like the main stem . gives us our shape , doncha see . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s one shape . fergiveness is another .
thing ' bout waitin ' on fergiveness ? mixes up who ' s waitin ' on who . <continued_utterance> <person> is simpler . an ' a lot shorter wait .
that will never happen .
never say never you always say that .
yeah . maybe .
what was that about the laundry ?
it is not my function . to weigh those probabilities .
you ' re right . <continued_utterance> . that ' s the jury ' s job .

<person> ?
just look around . there ' s a lot of her spread about . if you don ' t remember the face , you must have heard the name of <person> .
i ' m really embarrassed .
<person> ' t be embarrassed about having a good strong butcher ' s grip . do you link your own sausage ?
<person> , huh ? that sounds like fun . i have to work until nine tonight .
that ' s perfect . i ' ll come back here and pick you up . <continued_utterance> oh , and <person> . call your mom and tell her you ' re spending the night at alex ' s or something . it ' s going to be a very special night .
not exactly . it exists in a continuum that wasn ' t proven until ten years ago , a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe . an infinite number of them , in fact . it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe , space , or space-time . it was completely counter-intuitive . we had to unlearn everything .
is it intelligent ?
<person> curve . gives you more rotation , more movement . you try .
<person> ! let ' s go ! pitch it !
i ' ll pick you up in an hour .
no .
did you bring <person> ' s weights
they ' re coming <person> .
<person> , we need you !
we ?
this is <person> , obi-wan <person> . he ' s come to check on our progress .

as ship ' s counselor , it ' s your duty to know not only when you ' re needed . but also when you ' re not .
you can ' t fool an empath , captain . i know exactly when i ' m needed .
<person> ' t you two ever use a bed ?
let me show <person> your piece .
please , beverly , this is hard enough .
if you start tearing up i promise to beam you out . level one medical emergency . there ' s no crying in <person> . they head off toward <person> and <person> .
that ' s a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight-year-old girl .
something good game out of it . the dead can ' t speak . now i ' m their voice . <continued_utterance> <person> is dead , right ?
they ' ve already been identi- fied . there ' s no doubt .
of , god . <person> . kiddo , i ' m so sorry .
<person> , i want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier . i have a dozen tropical diseases i ' ll never entirely get rid of . i set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass . i have watched men die and i have killed . now i am serving my president and quite possibly not the best interests of my country , but my profession doesn ' t afford me the luxury of that distinction . i won ' t question your patriotism but don ' t you ever again question my command .
i ' m not under your command , general .
not now -- i just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and i have to --
nope . wedding before contractor . unless you ' re planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one .
i ' m not , i ' m head of english .
what really ?
i was just so desperately bored . i thought i ' d come over and make you dinner .
i am old enough to . to make my own --
how goes it , <person> ?
wonderful , wonderful .
we ' re not getting any younger , right ? and my career , well , it ' s gotten pretty , you know , frustrating . even with my new manager . maybe it ' s time to settle down .
if that ' s what feels right .
thanks . what are you looking for ?
oh , no , i mean . i don ' t know . i was passing by and thought maybe you might need some help . i know how to make furniture , and --
i can just feel my spirits soar .
well , i don ' t do it for just anybody . <continued_utterance> there can ' t be any wrong in this , ha .
it really worries me , <person> .
well , look , they have , doctors -- i assume -- that deal , only with , webbed feet . and , <person> , and i ' m talking strictly hypothetically , should that happen , we ' ll find one .
go to the sunset sheraton . right now ! just go ! go ! <continued_utterance> <person> shit . he ' s jacking her in to
my god , <person> . what is it ?
when he made his decision , he couldn ' t have known everything . especially not the way people like you do , who ' ve returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . because you are blameless , you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . but you have no idea how people lived here .
when he met <person> at his birthday and shook hands with him , was he pleased ?
i don ' t know . you can never know that because you ' re not there to observe it . maybe it vanishes . <continued_utterance> i should tell them you ' re okay .
what about the bicycle ?
why don ' t you come in the house with me ? take a break . i want to talk to you , you ' re not yourself right now .
this is just fucking typical , isn ' t it ?
<person> . big ears , too ?

<person> , i ' m sorry , there seems to be a mistake . i ordered the large cappuccino . <continued_utterance> do you think these cups could be larger ? they ' re practically bowls . <continued_utterance> i feel like i ' m having <person> ' s cuppuccino .

she had the biggest tits in the universe . down the block there is a girl walking a dog .
i heard she had breast-reduction surgery . her tits must be crazy perfect now .
the last time was a <person> . cheese party a year ago . he hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn ' t come out .
<person> . who ?
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves . <person> nods , depressed .
yeah . <person> , huh ?
yep .

every word , starling ? every gesture ?
right down to the kleenex i used . <person> , why ? is something wrong ?
why ? why didn ' t you tell me ?
how can you ask me that ? were we together ? where we going to be ? you had your world and i had mine . i wanted him in mine , not chasing through the universe with his father . <continued_utterance> he ' s a lot like you in many ways . nothing i could do about it . he ' s smarter , of course ; that goes without saying . most of genesis is really his . <continued_utterance> this is it , isn ' t it ? we ' re never going to get out of here .
you believe me , right ? <continued_utterance> dr . <person> , you believe my secret , right ?
i don ' t know how to answer that .
i don ' t dispute that in the wrong hands --

i ' m discussing it with you now . <person> , i want you to drop your investigation , save everybody time and trouble .

i just adore confidence in a man .

<person> . <continued_utterance> i thought it was <continued_utterance> for what ?
just a babysitter -- i mean . you ' re working .
you ' ll manage .
want some good news ? rcmp closed their investigation and the minister isn ' t indicting you . this could have been a real train wreck for you , <person> .
but , they won ' t help me . everybody is trying to destroy my experiment . and so are you , <person> .
<person> . i was wrong . i ' ve gone over your research . it ' s brilliant , <person> . it ' s mad , but it ' s brilliant . you have much work left to do . i want to help you , <person> . for the sake of science , go and do your experiment . leave . these kids alone and i ' ll help you .
now you ' re talkin ' . and when i do , i ' ll buy a cadillac , drive it through the ocean , and bring you back with me .
you can ' t drive a cadillac on water .
you always think you know what i ' m going to say , don ' t you ? you always think you ' re two steps ahead of me .
tell me your news , <person> .
you shouldn ' t have opened that . it was mi . fujiko how deceitful of me .
how can i ever hope . for your forgiveness . <continued_utterance> i have written this letter to the boy ' s parents . <continued_utterance> attraction is no crime , certainly among children . the dishonor lies in the concealment . from your families . <continued_utterance> i know that you know this . i know you have suffered . even if the hakujin could not . <continued_utterance> there will be no further letters . no contact of any k .
<person> up a story about meeting another guy . guess i wasn ' t so cute with an iv in my arm .
no , i think she really did meet someone else .
i ' m gon na do it , carmen . i ' m gon na sign up for federal service .
oh , <person> .
<person> . please . tell me what i did wrong .
you ' re in the wrong position . the wave doesn ' t crest that soon . <person> ten feet further away from the back wall .
we are nearly there . they are a horrible bunch this lot <person> so pay attention to what you are doing . <continued_utterance> put up some kind of a show , he ' s a hard bastard this `` good night '' <person> so don ' t get too clever , he used to be a pro . just keep moving round the ring , and let the odd one go when push has come to shove .
<person> ' s get on with it , shall we ?
no , sir .

the writer .
you were real close to all of them , to <person> , to <person> , to joseph , to baldur , and now <person> , so , let ' s hear the truth , let ' s come clean . what was your party number ?
if you are going to bully me like this , major , you had better do your homework . you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are .
it was right after <person> showed up . i was upset . <person> came up to me -- and i said something like : you ' re crazy to get married . it just came out . <continued_utterance> do you think it was totally the reason ?
no , no , no . <person> has been weird about marriage for years .
. what ' s that ? no , judge , not yet we ' re not . but we have reason to believe he may be involved with -- <person> ! he ' s overacting ! tell him -- <person> , judge . no . i just --
he ' s making him . <person> . <person> . he ' s --
yes , i ' m the box office .

<person> , eating at the core , eating it ' s way out . it makes me sick ! <continued_utterance> how do you turn this thing off ?
if that were so , why don ' t your people go and fetch her . ? what if i ' m speaking for them . ? <continued_utterance> . they send a hitter to negotiate . ? my question is : have you forgot your catechism . ?
and what ' s the answer ?
i know but --
but what ?
it ' s splitsville for you .
you faked my dad ' s murder . you used him ! where is he ! theo chases <person> and <person> around their car . he catches <person> and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand . <person> howls .
this is absolute nonsense !
well , i ' m just beginning to develop my theme . <person> ' t that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? <person> , so they played on your insecurity . that ' s human , understandable . but , there is one guy who doesn ' t like little k as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , <person> . he thinks you ' re the greatest , and when he says , i want <person> for my birthday , boy , they better go out get <person> . so , <person> calls and threatens you with little k . and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna , i ' ll give it to <person> as a birthday present in berlin . that ' s the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . <person> . <person> did you stay ? <person> did you play for them ? <person> were you the flag-carrier for their regime ? <person> ?
<person> --
i mean , i ' m not . i wasn ' t absolutely sure if . they --

your mother ? <person> , <person> , we were supposed to be up there hours ago .
it ' s her birthday tomorrow . and i don ' t feel right driving by her house and not stopping in , okay ? it ' ll just take a second . she ' s right off the freeway .

and that ' s what i ' m trying to tell you . what women are looking over , okay ? pecs and a cute butt .
you mean , like , `` he has the cutest butt '' ? where did i hear that recently ?
but you ' ve tested it ?
sure . each time it started fires inside the habitat .
mr . <person> was just telling me all about it . any idea who might have done it ? <person> looks quickly at harolday and back at <person> with frightened eyes .
not me . <continued_utterance> you ain ' t trying to pin it on me ? ' cause if you are , you ' re in for a big disappointment . i was over at the sun-up playing poker with the judge and the rest of the boys till early morning . if you don ' t believe me , ask for yourself .
what will you say about us ?
i will say that we can be friends .

<person> , i forgot you don ' t like flying , <person> .
i don ' t mind flying . but what you ' re doing is suicide !
<person> is helping your career , isn ' t he ? apparently he likes you . and you like him , too .
i never thought about it .
income of course , and then . . savings .

the medical staff . doesn ' t arrive until tuesday .
you and you . you ' ve just become nurses . <person> ' s go .
<person> doesn ' t care about power or weapons . all he cares about is getting back to the nexus .
what ' s the `` nexus '' ?
but he ' s the stable boy . he cleans after the horses .
<person> village idiot ! let the boy step forward . <continued_utterance> <person> .
overpriced folk art . is it the work of a soul that has suffered ? sure . are his explorations as an artist groundbreaking ? no .

what the hell did you go doing that for <person> ? we haven ' t even gotten naked yet !
we would have sooner or later .
it ' s made itself look like the woman ' s dead husband .
repeat the last item .
captain . it ' s about my work . about being a policeman .
<person> , if there ' s anything wrong , i ' m here to listen .
why didn ' t you say anything ?
<person> ' t want to believe it . <person> ' t even want to say it out loud . and now i have nowhere to love -- i meant live . i have nowhere to live .
my dinner .
i was wondering where you got that glow of good health .
something just moves past my leg ! <person> ! did you see that ?
what ?
<person> !
can you handle it ?
yes , that ' s what happened .
i have a different story to tell . i don ' t think you were tricked . not in the way you describe . i believe something else happened . i ' ve seen the hinkel archive , i ' ve seen records of phone calls , and putting it all together , this is what i think happened . i think <person> said , ' <person> , if you won ' t conduct for <person> ' s birthday , we ' ll get the miracle kid , the guy that critic , von der <person> , thinks is the greatest conductor in the world . he ' s not just willing to conduct for <person> , he ' s offered to sing `` <person> birthday '' as a solo . ' silence . <continued_utterance> come on , admit it . k worried you , didn ' t he ? he always worried you . in <number> , he ' s thirty-four years old , you ' re already fifty-six . and <person> and goering keep saying to you , ' if you don ' t do it , little k will . ' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty , humanity and justice because i don ' t care how great you are . it ' s the oldest story in the book , the ageing <person> jealous of the young buck . the real reason you didn ' t leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that , once you were out of the way , you ' d be supplanted by the miracle kid , the party ' s boy twice over , flashy , talented little k .
<person> on --
maybe older --
of course .
when you grow up within spitting distance of hollywood , every mother seems to think her child is the next <person> . so when i was about <number> , my mom started taking me to all these auditions for things .
what ?
you ' ve got <person> ' s rings .
not every chance i get . only for the a-list things . and my managing you -- it ' s all too much . i ' m starting to resent it . for the last two years it ' s been all about you .
well , for the first three years it was all about you .
<person> , take it easy . i ' ll trust your judgment - you don ' t have to protest with me . <continued_utterance> why are you trembling , dear . ?
history repeats itself . everything that happened to <person> . began with a smear like this .
oh . that ' s alright . then i ' ll come back at a better time . what would be a better time .
later on .
yeh , i think so . i gave the kay- ducer a c-note . you find out the deck ?
he usually plays with a royal or a cadenza . i got you one of each . he likes to cold deck low , <number> ' s or <number> ' s .
i thought i already did .
only in your mind , my very young apprentice . <person> ! ! hey , easy ! !
well , why do you ask me ? you ' ve seen her pictures in the paper .
go on , i want you to tell me .
i was younger . it was college . you didn ' t go to college , you don ' t know what it ' s like . you screw chicks you have no business being with . they ' re young , they don ' t know any better .
that ' s just plain silly . your self- esteem is just low because she ' s with someone else . but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad . it ' s no good , man . you got ta get out there . the ladies want to love you , baby .
shutting up , sir .
<person> , take these two over to the garage , will you ? i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner .
oh . sure -- if it would make a good scene .

the three of us .
that ' s right .

<person> ? well this is highly irregular .

<person> , i like you . i ' m going .

three different people saw <person> get into <person> ' car . a man who won ' t identify himself because he was jumping someone else ' s wife at the time saw <person> removing license plates from a red sports car . the police know about this man because he happens to be a policeman . <continued_utterance> mr greenleaf also feels there was a silent promise in <person> ' s letter to you which he intends to honor . he intends to transfer a good part of <person> ' s income from his trust into your name . he doesn ' t intend to give the italian police any information about <person> ' s past . he ' s rather hoping you ' ll feel the same .

what do you mean -- your murder , <person> ?
why ?
i don ' t know .
yes . and you ' re an accomplice .
i ' m not sure i understand .

i think it ' s probably still a good idea .
well . mostly .
my god !
welcome to hard times , <person> .

- you see , particularly with the <person> problem , you can just blame me .
<person> and i are getting married .

like it ?
like it ? it ' s love at first sight . <continued_utterance> now , i believe this is all really happening .

i like the sport the way it is .
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling . you got ambition like a . like a . blowtorch . you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht ! - shish kebabs . maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good . i think i could help you , theo .
this is admiral kirk . <continued_utterance> we tried it once your way , <person> . are you game for a rematch ? <continued_utterance> <person> -- ! i ' m

well , <person> , if droids could think , we wouldn ' t be here , would we ? kamino . doesn ' t sound familiar .
no , it ' s beyond the outer rim . i ' d say about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze , toward the south . it should be easy to find , even for those droids in your archive to find . those kaminoans keep to themselves . they ' re cloners . <person> good ones , too .
and your relations ?
on my mother ' s side the ardens
frankly , ted , i ' d be much happier if <person> was just a cold , emotionless intellect .
why ' s that ?
ah , i ' m sorry , man .
you know , it ' s funny i don ' t even feel related to my parents anymore . i feel like your mom and dad are more like my parents . i feel more scottish than italian .
oh -- it ' s you .
that ' s right -- your old pal <person> .
and <person> ? <continued_utterance> as a new member of our order , i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast .
a what ?
oh , ah , ah , but you do believe me . i see it . you do . i can get us out . help me . i swear to you . help me . and i will treat you like a brother . i .
my brother used to beat me nice guess , though .
so could <person> .
then why the rat ?
i should introduce him to your sister .
<person> and a cop ? that would happen .
and now to business . you will be delighted to hear we are on schedule . two hundred thousand units are ready , with another million well on the way .
that is . good news .
i love secrets .
that ulf report everybody ' s patting me on the back about ?
<person> , i don ' t know .
this is what happens after a couple gets divorced , the kid inherits all the problems . not that i ' m a kid . so how are you , how do you feel ? when can you go home ?
just remember - you ' re a target . <person> ' t you think <person> has a t . v . ?
magic time ! page <number> .
yes sir , colonel . and what a fine staff you ' ve assembled this year . have you told them yet about your army background ?
well , no , i didn ' t think it was .
water or mineral deposits .
<person> , that ' s what i ' m saying .
it could mean anything . if we followed every lead .
but , sir , the hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms .
yes . the old-fashioned way .
and what ' s that ?
d ' you have to say `` fucking '' every other word ?
what was that ?
you hear that , <person> . continue please .
i ' m afraid i can ' t cope with them .
i know you <person> . you ' re afraid of something . what ' s going on ?
let it alone , <person> . it ' ll take care of itself .
we learn by doing , lieutenant . <continued_utterance> you want my advice ?
yes .
hah . interesting , interesting . you hear what you said ? `` here goes nothing . ``
well , i meant -
you made squad leader on your own , and , hey , you still got me to kick around .
thanks , <person> .
i ' ll just be a minute .
<person> ' t .
yes . <continued_utterance> there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there , right by the dump , and <person> slowed down not to hit him , and he ran into the woods . and then <person> drove on and turned onto the marlowe road , as usual . i remember that . i ' m remembering it pretty clearly .
you are ?
<person> of the bowling gods , <person> .
see ya ' round <person> .
why not ?
see <person> , <person> ' s truck swerved off the road and ah . hit <person> and then a tree . she was pinned between the two .
i ' ll have him wave up to you .
<person> ' t she seem out of control to you ?
well , i don ' t think . <continued_utterance> go ahead .
here ' s the question . it ' s been on my mind more and more . do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating me ?
<person> ? who ?
organized rustling . well at least -- that ' s my belief . <person> was no friend of mine . too fond of taking the law into his own hands . but he had my sympathy . he ' d been harder hit than any of us . and on top of it all , he lost his foreman .
i worked so long that night . i ain ' t never fallen asleep driving before . and never since . most of the ride home , there wasn ' t a car insight in either direction . if i ' d fallen asleep then , i ' d a ended up in a ditch with a head ache . it had to happen at that right moment . that certain ten-fifteen seconds when i passed her walking . it was like it was meant to be . <continued_utterance> i guess if this is the end of the world , i ' m screwed right ? people who kill reverends ' wives aren ' t exactly ushered to the front of the line in heaven .
where you going <person> ?
we ' re tearing this place apart looking for them . but the computers are down , and the fires destroyed half the files . so far , nothing . <continued_utterance> if it was just part of the warp drive , i ' d know what to do . but this . it ' s like trying to rebuild <person> ' s airplane with canvass and sticks .
wait a minute .
givvem a cigarette .
. they ship our old mill from new hampshire ?
well , how about we wait and see what <person> comes up with ?
sure , why not . give him the trophy . that pretentious son of a bitch . you heard him , norman . all that `` someone went to a lot of trouble , try again '' bullshit . and `` impotent '' . where does he get off saying i ' m impotent ? he ' s a fucking self-righteous , little prick .
you fucking scared me
<person> ' t i always say call me first if you ' re coming into town ?
<person> said she ran away about six months ago .
but she could still be around ! hiding or something . i mean , she could have actually been here when you saw her !
so they ' ll just keep coming until we release him .
unless we match their commitment with our own .
that ' s where <person> is . <person> - october <number> , ' <number> . <person> - october <number> , <number> . both disappeared from greenville . <person> comes back to the same spot , once a year . today ' s the <number> th .
<person> . when did we establish that <person> was real ?
had to get away for his health , i suppose .
you don ' t believe me ? look in the garage .

she didn ' t like me , anyway .
she thought you were money .
<person> . <person> ' s have some drinks .
<person> ' t we wait for the others ?
<person> , what ' s the matter ?
nothing .
just a scene i cut out .
what scene ?
i know , i know . but now the director of national intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program , and until we train up another candidate , we ' ll need to keep <person> around to demonstrate it .
oh .
<person> , you can tell the computer to override the security system .
attention ! this is <person> . the empire has takes control of the city . i advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive . <continued_utterance> this way .
it ' s important . we had a little trouble in chicago today . one of our runners got hit for <number> grand .
which one ?
i ' ll give you a lift .
well , i don ' t want a lift , i really want to commandeer the vehicle . <person> just let me commandeer the vehicle .

what about those other passengers ?
no .
you didn ' t see the wedding ring on his finger ?
communism ' s over .

oops , i guess you haven ' t got that far in your anatomy class , huh ?
no , what does that mean , find the clitoris ?
<person> , <person> ! what , <person> ?
i want to come back . i want to take care of you and <person> . <person> .
a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?
when are you gon na get off my case ? have you got a search warrant ? what do you want -- cheap thrills ?
you recall lt . <person> ' s testimony ? he and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found . so no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims . that ' s also rather convenient , isn ' t it , mr . <person> ?
since i am innocent of this crime , sir , i find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found .
sure , this ' ll go on all night .
i mean , could you put me up for a couple of weeks ?

it ' s so beautiful . it ' s just what i would have picked out if i ' d had every ring in the world to choose from . you see what i mean . there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises , but i am not one of them . surprises are highly overrated .
. here ' s the deal : . this is the man . . you ' re covered in blood .
<person> , it ain ' t mine . on my team , sir .
progress ? have you charged him ?
no , <person> .

you bastard !
we can still see each other . just like always . it ' s a different kind of sin . <person> .

death storm . <person> wave cracks her steel hull amidships , one inch crack from starboard to port . men go in the water . <person> lost . after a week . <continued_utterance> they come to <person> , call off the search . he stands like a stone . then turns , sharp , the way he does . says only , ' he ' s alive . and i know where . '
why would you let her to do that ?
it ' s not human , <person> . whatever it is , it ' s not human , and i am threatened by that . evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened . and i want to win . i want humans to win . so i am killing it before it kills me .
what do you think i can do ?
i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you ' re the king .
you want to tell me how you ' re doing this ?
close observation . you could say i ' m a collector of moments .
indian trouble -- <person> , they ain ' t been any indian trouble around here in --
you want to hear the rest of this ?
yes , my master .
he could destroy us .
and that was only my first try .
well perhaps better than my first .

how fast would you say mrs . <person> was going ? to the best of your recollection ?
<person> this out , pal . his father ' s a federal agent for ten years .
<person> ' t get in my face , <person>bard . i might decide you ' re an ethiopian .
he targeted mr . <person> the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in aruba .
only the new improved mr . <person> was going to meet he ship .
it ' s an old psychological strategy , <person> . to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy .
it ' s working .
what ?
nothing . it was my attempt at humour .
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before . as an android , i am in complete control of my neural net . the information contained there can not be forcibly removed .
you are an imperfect being . created by an imperfect being . finding your weakness is only a matter of time .

initiation . you understand . later on , we make her wear her underwear on her head .
oh , my god , i can ' t remember if it ' s six-seven or seven-six .
try one ! try it !
i understand why it would seem confusing . <person> human rituals -- like weddings , birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions . these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time .
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander <person> will be leaving to assume command of the titan ?
since <number> . <person> , over <number> years .

we didn ' t just have sex either .
then what was it ? love to know .
i had an idea for a breakthrough in french toast so i made breakfast . i don ' t want to be teased about it . no sarcasm . no tough love . just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction .
right . mean ol ' me . i can ' t play right now . i have to do something about your brother .
i did , terrance , i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face !
<person> , want to see the northern lights ?
doing our business is what computers are for . <person> , <person> , with all respect -- icom isn ' t the business you started in your garage anymore -- <continued_utterance> we ' re billing accounts in <number> countries , we ' ve got one of the largest systems in existence .
oh , i know all that . sometimes i wish i was back in that garage .
look , i don ' t have time to fuck around . there ' s somebody out there i don ' t need to see . you got a fire escape or anything ?
no .

i can ' t give you pictures because i don ' t know what they look like . we did everything at arm ' s length .
so you got nothing .
i told you to forget it . your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow . in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers .
yes , sir . i think those new droids are going to work out fine . in fact , i , uh , was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season . and if these new droids do work out , i want to transmit my application to the academy this year .
i ' m not sure . i was confused . <person> . i think mostly i wanted to scare them .
you had a gun with you ?
it ' s fuckin ' gross .
this isn ' t happening .

<person> .
i know but -- smith stayed with me through chemo . if he could stay with me through that , i should be able to stay in this relationship for him .

i know you wouldn ' t be saying all this if you didn ' t care about me .
well . the world ' s not fair . you said .
that ' s something the world is always teaching us . and sometimes , the learning comes later . that gets through . both adults can see it . quoyle you taught me that . <continued_utterance> you know . what we wait for ? it ' s like the main stem of this boat . it gives us our shape . <continued_utterance> see , i know why you saved a place for petal . all this time . <continued_utterance> cos i ' m the daddy . and you learn how to do . by watching me . <continued_utterance> you just watched . better than i knew . <continued_utterance> watch this .

i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . <person> straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .

because i knew you ' d freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn ' t even come on this trip . but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you . we ' re here to forget about all that shit . we ' re here to party !
i ' m going to be a fucking pariah . everyone ' s just going to be holding their breath to see if i ' m going to get drunk and make a scene . <person> fucking <person> ?
i love <person> .
you love me and you ' re not marrying me .
your report says death by <continued_utterance> can you tell whether an object moved against the head , or the other way around ? or would both look the same .
the same .
almost three .
is this it ?
you okay ? except for being thirsty ?
i ' m busy , i ' ll see y . <continued_utterance> quoyle ounce southern comfort , ounce <person> . <person> . three ounces o . j . <continued_utterance> got it .
how big ' s your medical staff ?
the medical staff . doesn ' t arrive until tuesday .
just do it .
i ' m going to this fucking party .
how will it ?
i don ' t know . it ' s a mystery .
<person> ? what time is it ? are you alright ?
well , no , i mean yeah i ' m fine , but listen . <person> , the craziest thing happened to me tonight .
i don ' t look any good in clothes and i don ' t know how to drive .
forget it .
so , what does the russki want ?
colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you .
the shirt crackles and burns .
what ' s it gon na be , theo ?
well . everybody has reversals . if you were never down how would you know when you were up ?
that ' s good . that ' s really good . you have a gift for words .
who ' s fucking around ? i ' m not making fun . <person> ' s do it , baby .
the trick is to look like you don ' t need it , then they give you shit for free .
<person> . <person> ' s go . hit me . <continued_utterance> <person> . you have to stop hitting me now or i will die .
<person> .
sit . <continued_utterance> <person> .

<person> ' t call me ever again .
<person> , i guess you were home . she hung up on him . he ' s frozen . he hangs up . <person> .
no .
is she looking now ?
his , <person> .
uh-huh . did he ask you to come alone ?
about eight-thirty in the morning .
was anyone waiting for the bus with you ?
. you left something back inside .
. i left my case inside .
yes , exactly , but his first , his first conclusion was that <person> was killed not later than seven o ' clock yesterday evening .
well , he certainly wasn ' t dead when he drove off in his car .
on the radio they say it ' s good .
<person> up .
come here .
hey . !
oh , daddy . you know how jealous people get .
i ' d almost believe that . but i was behind the first aid station when you said the `` princess '' line . this park exists because the kids here work hard . they need to be treated fairly . they need to see you are just another lifeguard .
you follow your desire freely enough in the night . so , if that is all , to greenwich i go .
then i will go with you .
what ?
we did this job a while back . this woman .
i thought you had more faith in me than that .
i ' m sure you ' re good , but all that paper leaves a trail . <person> gets too curious -- fbi , irs , whatever -- that trail ' s gon na lead to somebody .
i will leave whenever it is good for you and .
no . no . come on , man .
parochial school . <person> . st . <person> ' s .
you were unhappy ?
sure . what do you want ?
<person> . can you get her ?
i reckoned i could still see the blazing girl you used to be . but now ?
shut up !
i need a ticket to <person> .
<person> ?
will you do me a favor ?
what ' s that ?
what ' s so special about <person> ?
i read this book where he said something like , `` if you have the opportunity to help someone and don ' t , then you ' re wasting your life . `` and he was a carpenter too .
you think they ' re watching ?
oh , they ' re watching all right . they ' re watching .
everyone ' s dreams in all those apartments . all those secrets we ' ll never know . that ' s the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know .
it ' s true .
where ' s the copy ?
at the point of issuance . could be the american consulate in tel aviv . the american consulate in amman , cairo , alexandria , riyadh -- all an easy drive from the west bank --
that ' s a lot of energy . what could generate power like that ?
the closest you could come is the new york city subway system .
`` my thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved . i can live only wholly with you or not at all . ``
good stuff .
but she fully looked way better before . i thought when they reduced them , they just kind of reshaped them nicer . made them more supple .
i can ' t even begin to imagine the justification for making breasts smaller .
i have lived with a secret obsession many years myself . however , i realize the other person has no interest in me -- so i pursue my career which is going even more unsuccessfully .
who are you in love with ?
ah .
nice to see you , <person> . how are things ?
no use -- he ' s gone .
mebbe we winged him .
who is she ?
what ? <continued_utterance> oh come on , <person> .
give me my fifty dollars .
i spent it .
we need this liquor !
you need it ! i don ' t need it . i ' m going to tell helen i like her , and then maybe she ' ll get with me ; not after i get her stinking drunk .
i ' m look at his whole history ! citations , letters of commendation , even his fucking test scores from quantico .
i don ' t believe it .
it was my fault not detective keegan ' s , i ' m sorry for all the fuss .
you all ready ?
whose side are you on , mr . <person> , his or mine ?
frankly , mrs . <person> , i ' m a neutral observer for the united nations .
are you kidding ? because i think it ' s good .
so do i .
sister , may i be excused ?
christine .
-- okay . <person> paint . voice-altering technology --
-- available from the sharper image catalogue .
i could never read that far . i never wanted to .
that far in what , <person> ? <person> doesn ' t say anything . <person> waiting .
how do you know ?
there are many ways of seeing .
he ' s saying , `` take me to your leader . `` he wants to know who ' s in charge .
i ' m in charge . <continued_utterance> with an `` o '' . <person> with an `` o '' .
i want cristina . i want to talk to mrs . <person> . i want to quit .
i don ' t think you can do any of it right this minute .
<person> , sir . <person> ' t you remember ? i was captain of the team .
i ' m not interested in nostalgia , <person> , i need a corporal . you ' re it until you ' re dead or i find someone better . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t worry , birdie , your next arm comes with a factory guarantee !
i . need . to <person> . to do something .
i am here to get the girl back .
<person> noches , amigo .
ha llegado anticipademente , senor .
how ' s that ?
i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks , he breaks my arm , tries to kill me . i swear man , the guy thought i was a piata . if nobody else hadn ' t a been there , he wouldn ' t have stopped . he woulda killed me . <person> ' guy man , just snapped . how do you like your burger ?
i don ' t know .
can i talk to her ?
<person> ' s say for a moment <person> does exist . you think he ' d just fall to his knees and cry , `` yes , i did it ! i confess ! by all means , please add a life term to my sentence ! ''
it wouldn ' t matter . with <person> ' s testimony , i can get a new trial .
i don ' t know <person> , i am not a dog . ask him . it ' s like he ' s got a fuckin homing beacon . give him the chance and he ' s off .
you ' re going soft <person> ? here pass me a sandwich . <continued_utterance> <person> , he didn ' t even chew it .
with all the blood i guess they didn ' t see the rig . <person> had it under a wig .
<person> , but how ' d it get to you ?
what ' s this ?
your new chair , sir .
has he ?
you know he has . you ' re not a complete fool , are you ?
what you hear isn ' t half of it . he ' s got scams you haven ' t dreamed of . kickbacks on his kickbacks . there ' s a river of dirty money flowing through this place .
money like that can be a problem . <person> or later you got ta explain where it came from .
will you take me ?
i ' ll give you the name of-the detective to see-
<person> hell . you won ' t even get a review till you ' re seventy . and if the board starts to go soft , we ' ll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who ' ll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin ' there later . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t be a sap , kid . you could save us a little trouble . but <person> is through whether you help us or not . there ' s nothin ' left to do now but save yourself .
will you wait until the chump is played ?
yes . but now , every time i look down at it . i see him . not me .
you could look at it and see a man who loves you and wants you to be happy .
so work harder , goddamnit ! you think you ' re the only one on this team works hard ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
i don ' t understand you . you speak too fast . i just don ' t understand !
he is not here .
where can i reach him ? maybe somebody else in the house could tell me .
and we ' re gon na let quoyle have his head on these columns , up to <number> words . so he ' ll get his confidence up .
well , let ' s not go overboard . he ' s rather green doncha thi .
no , no , no . <person> has been weird about marriage for years .
i keep thinking i should tell <person> .
yes , <person> .
<person> , <person> go back to bed , and remember we love you .
you are ?
yes .
you can do it .
because i ' d met someone else .
you ' re ahead of me there .
have you seen the sistine chapel ?
. i ' m going to ask you to do just the one more thing . <continued_utterance> i ' m going to ask you , now , to walk away from this plane , and come with me .
no . leave me alone . no - i don ' t know you .
where ' re you gon na go , bitch ? besides , you know that if you left me , i ' d hunt you down and kill you , right ? i ' m gon na go grab a drink .
what are you doing ? ! get on with your misery !
. that ' s right .
nice place you got here .
the writer .
he saw the accident . ?
who are you ?
i am the money !
. and i ' m deaf .
everyone ' s looking
maybe it ' s not the sex . maybe , it ' s the cheating . for me . that would be the thing . that it happened behind my back .
that ' s what she said .
i don ' t tell her a thing .
why ?
what . what is he doing .
we have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines .
i am .
but that ' s absurd . the fact that he employs one of the clews brothers doesn ' t make the other his friend . <continued_utterance> oh , <person> , this is <person> harolday -- <person> martin , <person> ' s aunt . you should know one another , seeing you ' ll be neighbors . <person> harolday runs the santee ranch for her stepfather . she ' s a famous -- ah -- horsewoman in these parts .
i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception .
it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi . not being able to visit the places you like . or do the things you like .
<person> like what ?
like we ' re being watched !
huh ?
the autopsies .
that is a contradiction . the borg act as a collective consciousness .
i am the beginning . the end . i am the one who is many . i am the borg .
it was a big hit .
i remember you told me you were scottish , but do you really like haggis .
what happens if it doesn ' t match anything ?
you toss it and try the next one .
then let ' s not and say we did .
that was easy -- what a nice guy . you ' ve probably never done a mean thing in your life .
<person> . it ' s like cow ' s urine poured down your troat . you wonder ' do i want this ? ' i ' m thersty . but it ' s urine .
<person> luck <person> , i ' ll make sure <person> is . kept safe ?
hyperdrive .
i ' ll get my people to work on it .
this whole thing is bigger than you , asshead ! just go in there and buy the damn alcohol !
what if i don ' t feel like it anymore ?
you fixed this suit ? <person> ?
yes , norman . i did . you ' re just nervous .
i haven ' t seen him . it ' s possible he came in through the south entrance .
it ' s possible ? why don ' t you go find out ? it ' s getting dark out there .
<person> , <person> .
<person> ! !
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project . we are in little danger of being left alone for long . you ' ll need to do something . otherwise they ' ll be sending someone out to recover you .
<person> said he thinks <person> should be destroyed .
for some , it does . agnis not for me .
and if that ruffles some small town feathers .
<person> . things . things are not always what they seem to be .
like what ?
what ' s the <number> st ?
what d ' you care ? you ' ll never know .
if i had , there would have been some evidence . they would have found something at the factory .
i see . so you don ' t believe anymore that the company covered it up ? <person> shakes her head no .
growing up i quit speaking after that . i didn ' t say a word for three years . when you ' re not in the conversation , you get forgotten real quick . so i ' d watch people . study them . the mouth can say anything , but the body doesn ' t lie . the tilt of the head , the way the hands move . <person> draws closer . <person> watching her mouth .
how ' d you get your voice back ?
<person> . <person> .
i know . i write like a child .
i ' ll miss you so much .
<person> . that ' s very good . <continued_utterance> what you ' re grown-up enough to know . is that people . can do <continued_utterance> when you ' re in trouble . have me there . when you fall in love . have me there . you can . <continued_utterance> that ' s how we go on , you know . forever . <person> someone takes us along . <continued_utterance> on your wedding night . when your babies are born . i want to be there . will you take me ?
i guess .
the landlady - as far as i could tell , the landlady said he was here right now .
<person> ' t it a lovely day ?
what happened to summer ?
do i really sound like dr . <person> ?
in recognition for his outstanding achievement in the field of child psychology , his dedication to his work , and his continuing efforts to improve the quality of life for countless children and their families , the city of philadelphia proudly bestows upon its son dr . <person> . that ' s you . the mayor ' s citation for professional excellence . <continued_utterance> wow . they called you their son .
what does that mean ?
well , one day i ' m invited skiing , the next day i ' m not , one day we ' re all one family , the next day he wants to be alone . you tell me .
who says ?
water softens up the dirt .
downstairs . i have a surprise for you .
<person> . i just wan na do a quick twenty minutes on the stair master before bed . <continued_utterance> i ' ll do forty tomorrow .
we ' re caught in a tractor beam ! it ' s pulling us in !
but there ' s got ta be something you can do !
she was real clear about my check . it ' s no fun workin ' if you don ' t get paid .
at least she took her toys . wanted her to be happy . he staggers out of the room , down the hall .
who ' s got him ?
<person> and <person> .
but -- there ' s so much more to do right here . and look , if it ' s about me , i mean , i ' m gone .
indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing .
reckon it is pretty nice . so you ' re moving in on the `` k . c . `` eh ?
we-el , not exactly moving in . you see .
actually , we haven ' t . your operational awareness has become too great . if you found out the truth about yourself once , you might do so again . as for <person> , i ' m sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours . <continued_utterance> do you have the courage to serve your country one final time ?
i ' m going to find you , rutledge .
i think that ' s what i ' m saying .
you okay ?
these were real people ?
yes .
he didn ' t say no . that was <person> ' s point . given how <person> ' s mother felt , <person> was <continued_utterance> no . <person> did not wish to beg , he respected <person> ' s right to reflect . he was sure <person> would do the honorable thing . nels and did he ? <continued_utterance> the night of the <number> th , <person> helped <person> at sea . with his dead battery . <continued_utterance> right there , on the boat , they agreed . $ <number> for the seven acres , $ <number> down . they shook on it . <person> was so excited when he came home .
and when did you first learn . that <person> had drowned ?
i ' ve come at a bad time .
no stay !
-- i know . he ' s soulful when you don ' t expect it , right ?
it ' s unnerving .
no , there was an accident .
i ' ll show you a fuckin accident .
yes ?
when i twisted hair like this it means i ' m intimidated by you .
<person> for you . go find out .
well , my parents are against it , and i know it ' s my choice , but i was wondering .
all we need is the bookie setup for now . we ' ll worry about the telegraph office later .
all right , i ' ll rent ya everything i got in the warehouse for two grand . that ' ll give ya phones , cages , blackboards and ticker gear . you supply the guys to move ' em . if you want a counter and bar , that ' s another grand . i don ' t know where the hell i ' m gon na get ' em though .
mr mclean i kid you not . why do you think we have a dead man , missing an arm in our office ? give us four days and we ' <number> bring you a stone the size of a home .
what do you think <person> ?
<person> .
<person> , got ta be ! miles <person> ! she ' s gon na blow him away ! <person> motions to <person> and breaks into a run . <continued_utterance> come on . <person> ' s go . let ' s go ! !
<person> ' s just say i missed my chance , and <person> saved me from a death worse than fate . i was very nearly a trash rat .
oh . <person> save .
his best friend is killed in a duel by <person> ' s brother or something . his name is <person> .
<person> good name .
<person> ' t yell at her !
<person> , if you all don ' t want to eat , then i ' m going to have some of everything . <continued_utterance> this tastes so great .
<person> was crying for six hours straight and <person> was in with her all that time mostly saying , `` he ' ll be back . he ' ll be back . `` i ' ve got to get back to georgie .
i just hate that you had that kind of a night .
<person> . morning . <continued_utterance> my stitches must have ripped .
i thought you were scared of blood ?
that was a little joke .
<person> . that is a difficult concept . it is not logical .
now wait a minute . if we made it a girls ' softball team , put in a few numbers . <person> make a cute musical : it happened in the bull pen -- the story of a woman .
you trying to be funny ? -- because i ' m all out of laughs . i ' m over a barrel and i need a job .
<person> ? what storm ?
a cyclone ' s on it ' s way in . i thought they would have told you on the phone .
let him have his game first , hammond .
this is the first time i ever waited for a murder suspect to play tennis before i pulled him in . when the boys it headquarters heir about this they ' ll send me orchids . <person> and <person> come into the scene just as the players from the previous match emerge . they pass through , nodding to <person> .
for a fee .
i never use mine . but it ' s a good thing to have . just as a threat .
seriously , they ' re really good , miss . ?
christina .
who was it ?
she was real . where did she come from ? <continued_utterance> tell me . i won ' t think you ' re insane .
and you saved us a fortune . do you know what our bill would ' ve been at that little eye-tie store front ?
and we picked up two million dollars . one billionth of a percent commission is -
no .
what about . <person> ? what has she told you about me ?
meaning ?
we enter first , take a look , then fill out the warrant .
i can ' t promise you that .
i have a lot of work to do .
relax now , <person> --
you think you ' re alive and safe , but you ' re already dead . everybody , you , him . everybody . you ' re all fucking dead ! <continued_utterance> you ' re the one living in a dream , <person> , not me ! because i know it happens . it happens !
<person> : let ' s page five , the fucking horse dies . you know , she could be in the movie , she could , she ' s got a good face , she could be the doctor ' s . uh , why does it have to be his , uh , wife . ? it could be his .
<person> , <person> , stick to the business , will you ?
we could send reinforcements now .
absolutely not . those bastards are just waiting in there for us . no more of this fancy super-soldier shit . we do it with the hammer . rubrick and sloan exchange a nervous glance as church paces agitatedly .
he was a tear-off rat . he got what he deserved . no sense helpin ' pay his bills .
<person> off , <person> .
how do you know , you don ' t even speak <person> ?
you listen to the feelings , not the words .
<person> ?
your new number . area code : <number> --
so was i , if you ' ll remember .
he is too old . yes , too old to begin the training .
i don ' t know . tastes okay to me . hey , they got a reserve pinot .
let me use your phone .
yes , you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased ' s right hand . the report says ' recent origin ' . how recent ? as much as <number> hours before death ?
absolutely not . probably one or two hours . four at the most .
and i ' m not quite human . so what am i ? what do you see ? do you see a life you might have led ? lost youth never to be recaptured ?
i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is .
seems i got ta learn how to do that love ' em and leave ' em stuff .
fucking men . you don ' t care when i say fuck , do you ?
you want a glass of wine or something ?
i was just gon na give you a kiss hello .

of course not . why would i lie about a thing like that ? really . he ' s . out .
we ' ll wait .
to happy endings . <continued_utterance> sir . i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding . i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse , laughter through tears , but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously .
i understand why it would seem confusing . <person> human rituals -- like weddings , birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions . these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time .
but that wasn ' t so long ago . it couldn ' t have been more than .
twelve years , sir .
oh but of cou<person>se children are going to see it ! !
uh , can i finish ? can i finish ? . the fact is that we canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-

<person> . i ' ve never seen you like this .
<person> , you ' re turning into some kinda squid-head low-life . you ' re always broke , you just go from one score to the next . and you ' re getting strung out . you don ' t even see it . getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer .
how much are your rooms ?
thirty-seven fifty for one person , forty-nine fifty for two .
how ?
because the best thing about people . is they can forgive each other . i heard that this morning .
<person> , <person> . you ' re on internal power and ready for lift- off .
final launch sequence checks . complete . <person> to begin final countdown .
i wasn ' t .
and tonight ?
you know that movie ?
one of my wife ' s favorites .
it ' s foolproof . we got a partner downtown runs the central office of the western union . race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies . all he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner . then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that ' s already been run . it can ' t miss , unless the western union dicks get onto it . <person> is amazed . he sits back a second , then comes

i think so .
hey fella ! relax ! this whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out . <person> ' s make love .
do you remember when you first got here ? we used to talk all night long . until the sun came up . we would just lie in bed and talk .

no way . no way .
<person> , <person> , please .
i can ' t .

bribing me again ?
and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart ?
for fun , baby .
you ' ll help me forget my troubles ?
you mean . we can ' t stop loony ock .
i mean the world is in danger .
by order of the master of the revels !
mr . <person> , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
i haven ' t enjoyed <person> this much in years . what a marvelous program . innovative . inspiring . you are to be commended .
well . thank you .
and what favour does mr . <person> receive from you ?

it ' s a convent . all you have to do is shut up , behave yourself , and get along .
no . no . thank you .
<person> , i insist .
is that right ?
so why ' re are you a fed ?
it ' s not how many years you ' ve lived , <person> . but how you ' ve lived them . <person> once told me that time is a predator that stalks us all our lives . but maybe time is also a companion who goes with us on our journey , and reminds us to cherish the moments of our lives . because they will never come again . we are after all . only mortal .
speak for yourself , sir . i kinda planned on living forever .
god , <person> , what ' s the matter with you ?
why do you assume it ' s bad ? maybe this is a good thing .
i am not going to give into this . i ' m not going to throw my life away . i have more important things to do than fall in love .
it wouldn ' t have to be that way .
i ' ll make this as simple as i can , <person> . they disappeared .
i don ' t care where you ' re from you just can ' t disappear into thin air .
they are not acted for you , they are acted for me . viola remains silent , in apology . angle on will . he is watching and listening . he has never seen the queen so close . he is fascinated . <continued_utterance> and -- ?
and i love poetry above all .

but . no .
i don ' t know enough to have a favorite .
c ' mon , everybody has a favorite player : <person> , <person> ?
which one do you use ?
that one .
a quart of matzoh ball soup for <person> . i know it ' s not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol .

all right .
we missed him .
you weren ' t hired to miss him .
i ' m done . it stops right now . <person> to declare your income .

<person> , sir . <continued_utterance> there ' s too much quantum interference , captain .

why not ? we can do it in mom ' s kitchen next . right over there .
i hope you make it to the states this year .
he was a good friend . the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship .
the police shouldn ' t have started shooting . but you can hardly blame them . you surprised them . they didn ' t know you were up there . when they saw you , they thought you were here to hurt us .
<person> . are you sure you ' re all right ?
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming . <person> , loss , remorse .
count <person> . no interest in contests , do i have . <continued_utterance> the end for you , count , this is .
. not yet .
yeah .
where are you ?
you would know , dummy .
you are pigeon-like in your intelligence .
oh --
and she , too , has opened her heart to him -- already she has summoned him to her .
<person> , my doctor , ' cause he ' s not too young for you , huh ?
no , he ' s totally too young for me . but we ' re just having dinner . it ' s not a date .
who else you got . ?
. we got the boyfriend , <person> .
<person> , it ' s been a long day . for all of us . but now we ' ve got to bring this home and catch a killer .
what ' s in it for me ?
you feel unsatisfied with our relationship ?
what is this ? why are you talking like that ? is this some kind of script ?
what do you mean ? she can , it can make me do something i don ' t want to do ?
oh , no . you ' ll want to . badly . you won ' t think about anything else . you won ' t sleep . you won ' t eat . you ' ll lie . and god help anyone who tries to stop you .
surveilling . what ' re you doing ?
driving to greenville .
the chip in the door . <continued_utterance> we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say <number> miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it ' s gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there isn ' t a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .
meaning ?
you ' re getting a rep , travis .
got the five you owe me , <person> ?
it ' s like a song .
oh .
a little . , hot , maybe ?
what ' d you do to me ?
wow .
what ?
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal , <person> hider .
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings .
it can ' t be easy down there , <person> .
what d ' you mean ?
what ?
you ' re breaking my ribs !
<person> ' t he .
it ' s .
i think i ' m in love .
you are .
this is great - great ! now we have to enter the front door !
<person> , it ' s really not my fault .
about what ?
about <person> , dumbass ! this whole thing has gone too far !
that ' s assuming <person> is even still there . chances are excellent he ' d be released by now . excellent .
they ' d have his last known address . names of relatives . well it ' s a chance . isn ' t it ? how can you be so obtuse ?
. six teams on the ground , at least . well , pull ' em off the un . <person> back .
not my first date , <person> . he ' s taking the bqe . <person> like it ' s brooklyn .
you got that big retarded girl down there ?
uh . <person> , <person> . she doesn ' t mean that . <person> lost the old filter with her last stroke .
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal
the exact words of the text . but do you understand it ?
your parents visit here ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
<person> , i hope so . maybe when they get some time off this summer .
as opposed to tonight ' s standing violation . you think marriage is going to make you faithful ?
yes .
oh .
<person> ' t you think you should put them in water .
and what you ' re telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
nobody ' s telling them to hate you --
it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies .
i didn ' t .
he turned out all right .
i so wanted to believe <person> . but the thalaron radiation can ' t be explained away . whatever he ' s after , it ' s not peace .
just a minute -- what all has she been tellin ' you ?
oh -- oh , really i ' d rather not --
what really ?
yeah .
you ' re wondering why i held it .
i ' m wondering how the judge is gon na like my waking up his old bones . in the middle of the night . <continued_utterance> your daddy . was quite a feller .
yes - i ' m on a good streak , thanks .
i was just looking at you - - so quiet .
look over there .
it ' s very unusual for someone your age to understand the kind of problems that private jenkins and private kinney have or even to be thinking about them at all . <continued_utterance> it is okay if i look back now ? <continued_utterance> tap the foot once for `` no '' and twice for `` yes . `` cole taps his foot once . <continued_utterance> you wouldn ' t want to take a walk , would you ?
nobody !
whatever ' s going on anywhere , i do not want to know . i don ' t want to know .
<person> , who is this man ?
and then i hear the best thing to do is feed ' em to pigs . you got ta starve the pigs for a few days , then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk . you got ta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out , you could do that after of course , but you don ' t want to go sieving pig shit do you ? ever seen the size of one of their molars ? he holds up his fist <continued_utterance> they go through bone like i t ' s butter . you got ta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute , . . . <person> <continued_utterance> hence the expression greedy as a pig .
let me talk to him . this isn ' t right . i ' m not your prisoner .
you feel unsatisfied with our relationship ?
<person> ' s not be foolish , <person> . <person> , aren ' t they ?
money .

i can ' t stay here . i want to go home . i don ' t want this skin . i don ' t want to look like this .

thank you .

i don ' t understand .
<person> minutes . that ' s all i could give you . no mission to fulfill . just . the two of you .
dr . <person> ?

koko .
<person> , yeah , with the kitten .
about her past .
i don ' t wan na know . i mean , look everyone has some skeletons in their past . i only care about the future . not the past .
a coup d ' etat ?
the <person> ' s power has always been the romulan fleet . they must be behind him .
but what . before that turns rotten . what if they surround the space with barbed wire , <person> ?
<person> ' t talk about things you know nothing about . he was in a dictatorship !
i ' m devious ? i ' m a bastard ?
you think i haven ' t noticed how you ' ve been worming your way in ? you keep your hands off my wife , you low-rent pedant .
yes .
maybe you can tell me what he ' s been doing in that silo . we heard some explosions out there this morning .
i ' m sorry , i just .
hey . at least it ' s not an editing machine .
uh-uh . you ' re on your own .
so i ' ll see you at the rehearsal .
in three years <person> will become the largest supplier of military computer systems . all stealth bombers are upgraded with <person> computers , becoming fully unmanned , <person> , the fly with a perfect operational record . <continued_utterance> basically . the <person> funding bill is passed . the system goes on-line <person> <number> th , <number> . human decisions are removed from strategic defense . <person> begins to learn , at a geometric rate . it becomes self-aware at <number> : <number> a . m . eastern time , <person> <number> .
and <person> fights back .
yes .
then don ' t be smart .

run him down , bring him in .
<person> .
what was it ?
i am so sorry . i -- uh . i ' d . i uh , can ' t tell . this is so uncomfortable .
why ?
to break the trail . if those cops had gotten hold of her , they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for , and then gone after them too . our killer is running as scared as we are . <person> makes him really dangerous . judging by how scared i am .
you really think he can find him ?
he ' ll find you moses and the burning bush if you pay him to .
thirty-seven fifty for one person , forty-nine fifty for two .

but sir , nobody worries about upsetting a droid .
that ' s ' cause droids don ' t pull people ' s arms out of their socket when they lose . wookiees are known to do that .
why ? you love your place .

i spent all evening on the mainframe . <person> altered or destroyed most of his patient histories , prior to capture . no record of anyone named <person> . but `` <person> '' sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce . i tracked it down in the library ' s catalogue of national yellow pages . it ' s a mini-storage facility outside baltimore , where <person> had his practice .
how deep is he ?
a thousand feet .

<person> ' t call me that .
<person> : i don ' t care about anything but the fact that you are here . you are her , you are <person> .
that ' s right .
did his parents attend to that ?
how long is that ?

it ' s like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?
and whom would you call ?
that ' s big of him . <continued_utterance> <person> , better question the next witness . i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes .
five minutes .
i am here to recover this mission , report my findings , and make a recommendation . now : what happened to him ?
the same thing that could happen to any of us .
they don ' t ? then why do they still write me fan letters every day . why do they beg me for my photo- graphs ? because they want to see me , me , me ! <person> .
<person> .
what are you going to do now , <person> ?
i don ' t know . <person> has a concert in athens next month - and he ' s asked if i want to go along , help out . he says goodbye by the way - he ' s in rehearsal , otherwise -
but i ' m not just another lifeguard .
you won ' t even be that if this continues . if you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours , i need to see real , concrete changes in your attitude .
it ' s the truth .
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape . how did you do that ?
<person> , <person> . tell me what you can .
no life signs -- but he was there . captured us . he -- he put creatures in our bodies . to control our minds .
<person> betchen mesa bottums .
what ? !
<person> , you can .
<person> , but i wouldn ' t mate . i don ' t want to . i ' m perfectly fucking happy where i am .
reese . you got a first name ?
<person> .
you don ' t believe that . i ' ve been to places you haven ' t . i ' ve crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying . and when i do , that veil gets lifted for just a second . and what ' s there is real . maybe it ' s a vision of the next world , but i can see it .
you can see it . but you can never get there without our help .
look who ' s talking ? who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour ?
so howsit ?
wow . well it ' s so good to see you . let me get your info so i can send you an invite to the baby shower . <continued_utterance> it ' ll be like a big reunion . the whole gang from high school will be there . <continued_utterance> so what are you doing now ?
i . i ' ve just gotten my real estate license , and so .
<person> ' t say that about my mom !
i had a career . she wanted a little bowler of her own . <person> and breeze leap into the fray , prying the two men apart . they wrestle theo against a wall , pressing his face into the tiles .
is this crazy ?
no . that ' s the weirdest part about it .
<person> , we just lost the main rear deflector shield . one more direct hit on the back quarter and we ' re done for .
<person> her around . <continued_utterance> i said turn her around ! i ' m going to put all power in the front shield .
did you ask her if she could live in ?
come on . there ' s no buses from her to here . there ' s no question . <person> come on . <continued_utterance> the barrio - <person> . the barrio - <person> . what to do ? <person> ' t worry . i ' m putting nicer stuff in here too .
<person> --
you think i ' d believe you ? believe anything you might say now ? after you lied to me about telling <person> about my past . about my problems . my problems . not yours . not his . <person> .
<person> --
i can ' t stay here .
tell ' em we ' ll have pie and punch .
we ' re not gon na have pie and punch !
i was .

how can you think of food at a time like this ?
our first order of business is survival .
mrs . <person> , if <person> <person> does not volunteer to say so in court , i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect . <continued_utterance> but in order to do that , you must let me bring a suit in your name <continued_utterance> charging negligent infliction of emotional harm . that ' s what i ' m now asking you to consider . <continued_utterance> it ' s clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event .
what other people ?
like all living beings , admiral each according to his gifts . the ship is yours .
that won ' t be necessary : just take me to regula i .
obi-wan is here . the force is with him .
if you ' re right , he must not be allowed to escape .
a blending of the organic and the synthetic . the highest form of life in the galaxy .
an interesting definition . but it is not one that applies to me . i am completely artificial . i have no organic components .
well , let me tell you something - don ' t . <person> ' t let them promote you . don ' t let them transfer you . don ' t let anything take you off the bridge of that ship . because while you ' re there , you can make a difference .
you don ' t need to be on the bridge of a starship . come with me . help me stop <person> . make a difference again .
no .
are you sure ?
extraordinary , isn ' t it ?
it ' s impossible .
remember you wanted to pay a call on the mcp ? <continued_utterance> we ' re on our way . <person>-one gave me the coding we need to go up against master
all right . <person> . <person> stayed awake , at least .
i am in no mood to go to any wedding .
we have to
i just got this bucket back together . i ' m not going to let something tear it apart .
then i ' m going with you .
i ' ve lost half a pound since tuesday .
<person> .
he thinks you ' re being a little careless . he made the point several times .
you live in manhattan ?
open the fucking door !
anybody else ? silence .
no . but i ' d stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you . i still don ' t know why you dropped her in the water .
i was attempting to . get in the spirit of things . i thought it would be humorous .
my lord , the fleet has moves out of light-speed . com-scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the hoth system . the field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment .
the rebels are alerted to our presence . admiral ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system .
she ' ll die before she tells you anything .
leave that to me . send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed !
go ahead ! open your fucking soda !
what ' s wrong with you , anyway ?
you ' re intimidated by him .
what ?
nobody dad , we ' re just talking .
<person> get suspended again ?
if the stores are open -
and on monday , i ' ll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
i know . this is a dream , <person> .
oh . yeah . they . make me take this stuff . <continued_utterance> hold me .
nope .
i ' ll walk you home , you can have my coat .
but , mrs . <person> , you ' ve got to make him do something about this . <person> ' t you see that just one word from him would extricate guy from this dreadful situation ?
oh , but <person> , i ' m sure this thing must be some practical joke . you know , <person> sometimes goes too far . of course i shouldn ' t be saying this to an outsider , but sometimes he ' s terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades .
you want to hear about destiny ? if my husband hadn ' t gone on a diet , which caused me to leave him , i would never have been on that flight to miami , and met <person> , and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a <number> with that nob you slide that says `` vacant-occupied , vacant- occupied , vacant-occupied '' --
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet .
<person> said <person> was trying to get back to the ribbon . if that ' s true , then there must be some connection with the amargosa star .
the star ' s destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector . however , none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon .
it has helped me a lot to have a goal , something to look forward to .
and what it that ?
cause i ' m tired of bein ' his nigger . i want you to help me break him .
c ' mon , i ' ll give ya a lift home . <continued_utterance> what ' s the matter ? you got ta get back to <person> ?

is it coming from our own computer ?
<person> thinks it ' s some sort of discharge from our own system , but i ' ve seen it discharge before -- and it didn ' t look anything like this .
no , no , that ' s too far . try a more gentle stroke . it ' s all in the stroke . go ahead , now , honey - stroke . as the camera comes around the side of the whale , we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman . his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it .
<person> ' . here goes nothin ' .
i can ' t do that . if i tell them , they ' ll , if i tell them , they ' ll try <person> for rape , they ' ll .

i ' m sorry <person> - ?

the silent , silent partner . he ' s the guilty one , your honor . the man with the bank accounts . that ' s where the filtering process starts . they trace it back , all they ' re gon na find is him .
oh , you know , <person> , i couldn ' t find a speeder i really liked , with an open cockpit . and with the right speed capabilities . and then you know i had to get a really gonzo color .
if you ' d spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit , young padawan , you would rival <person> yoda as a swordsman .
<person> ' s <person> .
you played for any particular mobs ?
it ' s risky , but we can ' t hold out much longer . we have no choice .
launch patrols .
i don ' t trust anyone who ' s too organized .

<person> , i know who i feel sorry for .
no hits . he ' s never been fingerprinted .
<person> . any activity on <person> ' s accounts ?
what ' s wrong with oxygen ?
it ' s a corrosive gas . on earth , it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly , iron rust on an oldsmobile . at a pressure this low , oxygen becomes toxic . breathe it down here , and it ' ll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile .
just . fucking . just rumors , mate , bullshit .
did you get drilled by the old bill ?
that ' s great . so i guess that means marriage now , huh ?
it scares me . my sister lived with her husband for five years before they got married . and now it ' s over . they loved each other so much , but somehow it just disappeared . <continued_utterance> st . eli <number> ' s fire - rev . <number> / <number> / <number> <number> / <number> .

shhhh -- she unbuttons her shirt . and they kiss .
<person> up , boys . while it ' s cold .
the colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous . <continued_utterance> we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders , and felt like free men . we could ' a been tarring the roof of one of our own houses . we were the lords of all creation . <continued_utterance> as for <person> , he spent that break hunkered in the shade , a strange little smile on his face , watching us drink his beer .
`` i am fortune ' s fool ! ''
`` why dost thou stay ! ''

i know we ' ll turn up trace elements of semtex , chemicals . something .

big deal . <continued_utterance> maybe we ' ll get a dog when we get back .

she won ' t ? why not ?
she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i ' m not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .
with who ?
<person> , now . you want to know why cbs has the highest ratings ? you their news is any different from nbc , abc ? it ' s all the same news . <person> stories . <person> order usually . what , you thought they had good news for people , right ? you thought that ' s why people watched cbs ? i ' ll tell you why people watch cbs . cronkite . the man . you got it ? not the news , not the issues , the man . if <person> told people to eat soap , they ' d do it . we are selling cars , goddamn it .

no , please , allow me .
no , no , i ' ll take it . no problem . <continued_utterance> the man does not know my name and i ' m doing his dishes .
he ' s sort of a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine , so it won ' t be too sad .
schmucks are people too you know . <person> doesn ' t seem a little harsh ?
what are you sellin ' ' em for ? why don ' t we start there . which makes the big man smile . just a little .

this is an important night for us . finally someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made . that you have put everything second , including me , for those families they ' re talking about . <continued_utterance> they ' re also saying that my husband has a gift . not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence . or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas . your gift teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would piss on themselves . yes , i believe what they wrote about you .
why not ?

the timing has never seemed quite right .
just keep your mouth shut , alright ? this could mean everything to our careers , you know that ? <person> ' t jeopardize this .
<person> ! <person> !
hmm . <person> , control . you must learn control .
those two guys were cops .

<person> , i am going for a much bigger prize kid . <person> , dokey . let me show you , kid , what i got here . <continued_utterance> present maximum anti-force power to date is <number> percent of theoretical limit . i have patched in the variable particle-wave accelerator . i will now try to reach <number> % power . and if your paper has any value . i can use it to get the power i ' m missing to create the anti-force , to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe , capish !
you don ' t understand . i ' m a friend of your daughter ' s .
<person> ? i don ' t think so . my daughter ' s in the city and you what , wandered in here , like high on ecstasy . ? . <person> . i dialed <number> - <number> - <number> .

oh no . i couldn ' t let it out of my house . you ' ll have to finish it here .
i was afraid of that .
i ' ve got twenty pages of notes . i ' ve got a pretty good character for the man .
it ' s definitely a step back for me .
<person> , there ' s not much of a call for shakespeare in this town .

<person> -- ?
it was a tough call .
i still can ' t square the psycho smarts of whoever did <person> with those two cops .
<person> ' -a . i don ' t need no smart wife-killin ' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat .
of course not . but you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift , and that ' ll cost you . a lawyer , for example .
it ' s forever you know .
<person> . is that the good thing or the bad thing ?
why don ' t you buy it , only forty bucks .
i have one , but they lost it .
and you have written pictures , haven ' t you ?
sure have . the last one i wrote was about cattle rustlers . before they were through with it , the whole thing played on a torpedo boat .
ambulance-chaaing , highway-robbing cocksuckers !
. or come to think of it , i suppose i could set it up for you . that would save you some money . i ' ll write down the forms you need , you can pick them up , and i ' ll prepare them for your signature . nearly free of charge . i ' d only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers , if that seems fair .
they ' re only peppers , <person> .
i can ' t believe what i just did . i innocently go to buy the nightgown and this amazing blonde salesgirl starts coming on to me . we wind up doing it standing up in front of a three-way mirror in the dressing room . <continued_utterance> if <person> would just marry me , i know i wouldn ' t do stuff like that -- it would be a legal violation .
getting so beautiful . she looks more like you every day . <person> . i ' ve really given this a lot of thought . a great deal of thought . <continued_utterance> i ' m gon na marry <person> . i know you don ' t think much of her but she ' s a special person -- she really is . and i love her . this is a bridge we never wanted to cross but it ' s not helping her or the kids if i don ' t really commit to that . <person> stares at him stonefaced . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t think a phone call was appropriate .
tell me exactly how you ' re different from three years ago ? the music sounds kind of the same from where i ' m sitting .
<person> . ! i thought you were dead !
i ' m not , but alot of my soldiers are . glass the planet !
<person> reports . we tap his phone .

if you could pick the shrimp off , as well as anything that touches the shrimp .
i ' m not sure if that will leave much on the plate .
i do very much . but i ' ve never met one i ' ve taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that ' s never happened to you before , don ' t you have to at least find out what it is ?
i suppose but , see , i don ' t date all that much or all that well .

why do you say that ?
he told me ! he told me so !

he attacked his neighbor with a machete . there was a woman involved .
because he helped me recruit the network in iraq . okay ? <continued_utterance> we were part of the operation to destabilize <person> . printing up fake dinars , arming the kurds --
-- and financing the sheik .
but then you were beamed away .
i was pulled away . i didn ' t want to leave ; none of us did . i felt like i ' d left a part of myself behind . all i could think about was getting back . i didn ' t care what i had to do . <continued_utterance> it took a long time , but eventually i learned to live with it . and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me . i knew things about people .
oh yeah .

<person> denied . if you can possibly endure any more of these assaults . i need you at my side . now more than ever i .

you don ' t have to understand .
and bringing the enterprise here ? ! what possible purpose could that serve ? !
there ' s been hundreds of parties mate , what ' s so special about this one ?
i dunno , i just wanted to see <person> didn ' t i .
the funny thing is , i ' m not <person> either . i ' m <person> .

i was getting a kick looking at you look at it .
i better get dressed again in case anybody ' s just a half hour late . <continued_utterance> okay . we ' re okay here . why can ' t everything be like sod ? there ' s no wait , no dung , nothing you have to do right and yet it ' s perfect . it covers up all your dirt and makes things immediately pretty . then , the miracle , if you just give it time , it roots and you can ' t tell it from the real thing . no reaction . nothing to say .
-- no .
-- but . that ' s what you want , isn ' t it ? why you ' ve done all this --
doing what , exactly ?
i don ' t know what you mean .
what happened to you ?
i can ' t remember very much . what it looked like or how long i was there . but i do remember how it felt . <continued_utterance> it was like being inside . joy . as if joy was a real thing that i could wrap around myself . i ' ve never been so content .
damn it , norman . i swear . i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up .
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .

i would suggest , <person> , for your own peace of mind , of course , that you work here at the house for a few days . it would be less embarrassing for you .
what did you do tonight ?
i watched tv .
`` i ' m so glad you ' re back . ``

as happens so frequently here on romulus , a new government came to power . they decided to abandon the plan -- frankly , i think they were afraid i ' d be discovered and it would lead to war . they weren ' t ready for that . <continued_utterance> romulan ale -- i ' m surprised . i can ' t stand it .
you ' ll acquire a taste for it .
and that ' s obviously why we haven ' t heard about it in the newspapers .
that ' s right . they fuckin ' own the papers , smartass . and everything else . why do you think scotland ' s not been able to get independence ? because the queen the pentavirate and those english dome heads in west minster won ' t have it .
you think he killed <person> ?
yes , i do . <person> ' s out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier .

<person> ?
sido-dyas told us to expect him . and he showed up just when your <person> said he would . we have kept the jedis involvement a secret until your arrival , just as your <person> requested .

. i used to wait two days . now everyone waits two days . three days is kinda money now , don ' t you think ?
that top cost more than my education .
my pants cost more than your education .
it ' s not my response . it just crossed my mind . we have enormous budgetary concerns here .
ugh . forget it . <person> is played by <person> --

<person> . <person> ' s a fine boy .
no , sir , it is not possible . the b- <number> is physically identical to me , although his neural pathways are not as advanced . but even if they were , he would not be me .
how can you be sure ?
why didn ' t i get off the train ?

he ' s around , don ' t worry . we ' ll find him .
no . i am your father .
no . no . that ' s not true ! that ' s impossible !
now , come , j . j . , that ' s a little too harsh . <person> seems fair game for you tonight .
this man is not for you , <person> , and you shouldn ' t be seen with him in public . because that ' s another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space .
where are you ? how did you find us ?
i ' m on the train .
he ' s going to pull us all apart .
go get him ! <continued_utterance> we ' ve got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in . here it is . cell twenty-one-eight-seven . you go get her . i ' ll hold them here . <continued_utterance> everything is under control . situation normal .

the orderly heard <person> whispering to him , all afternoon , and <person> crying . they found him at bed check . he ' d swallowed his own tongue . <person> is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit , and he ' s trying to blame it on you . i told the little prick your conduct was flawless . starling . ?
no , please . please . <person> , oh , god .
<person> down , <person> . it ' s gon na be what it ' s gon na be .
i remember you told me you were scottish , but do you really like haggis .

i can talk to alvarez . but i don ' t know . <person> ' s happy about this .
not for me . miniature golf ' s for pansies .
if the japanese are pansies , then pansies are my kind of people . <person> steps over to the booth with their food . the <person> burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball . <person> sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner .
they ' re holding it for ransom .

what is this ? the betty ford center ?
<person> , how ' s your video rep . <continued_utterance> what happened with <person> ? has nothing i said gotten through to you ?
you wan na fight ? you wan na fight ?
what do you want from me ? what do you want from me ?
there is something else , captain . one of the scientists . a doctor soran . has insisted on speaking with you . i told him you were busy , sir , but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away .
understood . that will be all .
i knew there was something wrong with them .
they ' re dead . they ' re finished . there was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world . but that wasn ' t good enough . oh , nol they wanted the ears of the world , too . so they opened their big mouths , and out came talk , talk , talk .
i got the bat at home . on the wall .
you got two minor league home run records don ' t you ?
but .
it will be human and it will look like this . but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know . that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have .
he saved my life out there . i guess <person> told you .
you should give it to him yourself . i think he ' s in the meeting room . doing . exercises .
<person> ?
it ' s very simple . you go your way , i ' ll go mine . thanks anyway , travis .
over by the rainbow room .
when youlre through with that thing , can i have it ?
<person> , mr . <person> .
here in history and moral philosophy we ' ve explored the decline of
soldiers deserve soldiers , sir .
but . one soldier against seventeen !
shooting at pila street , october <number> th . <person> . <person> pronounced dead at scene . <person> absconded : two males , early teens , one female , early teen .
but you : you ' re not a liar , <person> , that is for sure . you are too truthful .
no , sir . i would say `` negotiation '' is to be advised . i support all `` diplomatic '' overtures . but if you will excuse me , <person> , i have an appointment with the tholian ambassador .
then i will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with <person> . <continued_utterance> would someone please tell me what that was ? <person> security -- <continued_utterance> -- and have them run a --
alright .
who the fuck is that ?
well , you sure as hell don ' t want to get involved in evacuating people and that sort of thing . my advice would be to . `` avoid paperwork . ``
eliminate them , you mean .
that ' s why he went to all that trouble to capture you . plcard how long does he have ?
i can ' t be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating .
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs , major , and if you ' re walking me into a trap-
bugs don ' t lay traps . they aren ' t intelligent ! unlike you , they ' re stupid enough to follow orders !
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night ?
i had a regular job for a while , days . you know , doin ' this , doin ' that . but i didn ' t have anything to do at night . i got kinda lonely , you know , just wandering around . so i decided to works nights . it ain ' t good to be alone , you know .
<person> ? i was hoping .
i ' m glad you asked . i didn ' t want to be so forward . i mean , if you ' re waiting inside , then you feel obligated to entertain me and keep up the conversation just to be polite , and really your head might be totally elsewhere and then there ' s the chance that you would really want to talk and it ' s me who ' d be busy , but in an attempt not to be rude , i sit there and listen to some story that you don ' t really want to tell and i don ' t really have time to hear . you know ?
oh ! the evening before , i see .
yes , dr . <person> was absolutely clear about this : politics and art must be kept separate .
no , no , no . <person> ' t be silly . uh , look , here ' s what we ' ll do . <person> and i will leave . we took a great walk on the beach , we ' ll go into town for lunch . you two stay . <person> , apologize about the near arrest .
no , you were impressive . <person> strong , very . `` macho '' .
i ' m here , sir , i just - i don ' t know how to feel about it .
you don ' t have to feel any way about it . <person> did it to amuse himself . why not , what can they do ? take away his books for awhile , and no jello . i know it got ugly today . but this is your report , starling - take it as far as you can . on your own time , outside of class . now carry on .
which part ?
any of it . why did he kill himself ?
<person> . i can ' t believe it . do you still like <person> movies ?
i ' ve got to go . nice seeing you . <continued_utterance> st . elmo ' s fire - rev . <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
oh yes . i remember everyone who was on the lakul . every face . even the ones who didn ' t make it .
<person> . it ' s important that you tell me what you know . we think <person> ' s developed a weapon . a terrible weapon . it might give him enough power to --
no , and i don ' t want to know . with you or without you we ' re putting <person> in play . now .
one more lamb to the slaughter .
just one question : does big know ?
where are we eating ?
does your brother know you keep those there ?
you not worried ?
well , for the first three years it was all about you .
i know . that was so much more fun .
because it feels really incredibly good .
so why are you asking me ?
<person> ! that ' s perfect , `cause , <person> , didn ' t you just say that you heard about a party ?
why didn ' t you tell me ?
i sent her to the party . i figured i ' d wait up here until you killed <person> .
what makes you think i ' m gon na kill <person> ?
. come in , please . this is reliant calling regula i . repeat . this is uss reliant --
commander , we are receiving . this is regula i . go ahead .
what ' s the surprise ?
uh . don ' t you have it ?
<person> , please ! i don ' t want any more guards !
i realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you , but perhaps someone you are familiar with . an old friend like . <person> kenobi .
<person> .
i ' m sorry about what happened .
<person> , where are you ?
i can ' t breathe . am i . clear ?
i have to go mom . the card ' s almost out of minutes .
where are you even staying ? <person> --
a man- it doesn ' t say his name . he is sort of bald , but has long hair on the sides .
<person> . my god , my god . thank you , <person> . you were generous the first time . but this .
where ?
you think he ' d tell me ?
two fighters against a star destroyer ?
the ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path . when you ' ve gotten past the energy shield , proceed directly to the rendezvous point . <person> ?
uh huh .
come in soon , my love .
i ' m so glad they still work .
well , well , now look who ' s got something that works .
<person> .
<person> , what ' s it like when you go through time ?

i ' ll come with you .
<person> ' s giving him to the bounty hunter .
<person> wants us all dead .

<person> to murder , <person> .
oh , yes . the algorithms on cloud seeding . great piece of work . how ' s it going ?
well , i don ' t know . i just tried to run this program i ' ve been working on , and i was denied access all of a sudden . i thought maybe i ' d been laid off and nobody told me .
i ' d rather you didn ' t .
do you have a girlfriend ?
you have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair .
no . way . no way ! <continued_utterance> oh , my god !
i went camping once . i love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed .
we ought to start camping again , dad .
the big question is who killed him .
always is , sir . i can give you a rough profile ; white male , thirty to thirty-four . has some college but no degree . neat in appearance . at least six feet tall . <person> intelligent . charming when necessary . he uses murder as a tool , probably in furtherance of a criminal endeavor . he ' s killed before and will again unless caught .
you see ghosts , <person> ?
they want me to do things for them .
passport to the universe .
i ' ve been thinking about applying for federal service , too . <person> , maybe .
how do you know where the gun is ?
i know where everything is .
it ' s not fair . i have to hide every erection i get .
sometimes i get boners so big i can ' t hide them . and then i get nervous and my heart starts pounding , and it all just , like , feeds my boner . it just becomes this . thing . that ' s attached to me . and it won ' t go away .
what ' s this all about ?
it ' s about destiny , <person> . about a <person> outcast who --
i was sleeping .
oh , shit -- i ' m sorry .
dowdy !
you been on the roids mate you ' re looking bigger ?
. and big fuckin ' teeth .

<person> ! ? that ' s the best you can do ?
what do you mean ? let ' s keep going .
we were expecting more from you .
i will play him . bring it tomorrow .
it ' s for <person> . he paid me .
the first and last words out of your stinking holes will be `` sir '' .
<person> , sorry . sir .

ummm . i don ' t know . i . think . maybe .
bottle- of beer .
<person> good . you owe me .
no , really , thanks .
you won ' t try it . i spent twenty minutes making it .
you ' ve been retained ?
yes .
i ' m sorry -
i can ' t afford to have an independent program monitoring me . do you have any idea how many outside systems i ' ve gone into ?
come on , let ' s go , i got to get back .
<person> cash ! <person> . here ' s everything i have on me , what do you say ? how about a rolex ?
i ' m a schoolboy - teach me , teach me .
why not break it up yourself ? you could do it in two minutes flat .
the exact words of the text . but do you understand it ?
uh , i don ' t know .
if you get a new wife , i guess you ' ll have sex with her , huh ?
what do you think ?
<person> . can you , like , slip out ? <continued_utterance> whoa . <person> ' . careful .

how come you ' re telling me now ?
i don ' t want to be wrong anymore . <continued_utterance> i want to say i ' m sorry , because i am . and let you hate me . if you have to . <continued_utterance> see that feeling ? where you feel two different things at once ? that ' s a grown-up thing . it ' s not a lot of fun . <continued_utterance> know why your mom never told you ? <continued_utterance> she knew that you and her were so . solid . nothing could rock that . but she didn ' t want to risk . <continued_utterance> . your hating me .
you still writing the occasional magazine article ?
occasionally .
the shah of iran , noriega , i love the way you guys predicted the collapse of the soviet union .
<person> , yeah , yeah . and j . <person> wore a dress . <continued_utterance> what do you say , <person> . ? peace ? <continued_utterance> this feels like high school .

well . we ' re getting married .
well , i ' m not that nice a person . <continued_utterance> she plays <person> . <person> to the barbies , like <person> talking to her . <continued_utterance> brings her cigarette . to the flame . <continued_utterance> she says she ' s sorry she left them . it was just to see if they could be good girls . and they were . <continued_utterance> . and she loves them . <continued_utterance> the barbies look better naked , <person> looks good in blue , guess who said that ? <continued_utterance> so we talked . just before <person> left her with that . stranger ? <person> had snapped her mom ' s bead necklace . that ' s why she ' s making more . <continued_utterance> when she ' s made enough . she ' ll be forgiven . <continued_utterance> she saves <person> a room at the house , but she ' s also got the key to the old place . in case her mom would rather go there .
and she talked about it . just like that .
what about the bicycle ?
what bicycle ?

oh . ok . <person> . <person> fu --
she has the best palate of any woman i ' ve ever known . she could even differentiate italian wines .

<person> doesn ' t deserve him , <person> . `dear <person> , i can ' t see you as i am shagging an old married man -
what ' re you doing ? ?
<person> ? that ' s d-list ' s car .
so this is where he hides it when he goes to shag <person> .
no , you ' re a petty burglar and a liar . you ' re no friend of <person> ' s . he is a great man . he ' s not like you or me or any of the other zombies walking around this town .
no . he ' s a man with vision . he can see beyond the problems that surround us . he knows there ' s a better future out there for everyone . a future where crime , poverty and war are things of the past . a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the stars . i believe in that future , too , <person> . i believe in it in every fiber of my being . and i ' m telling you . if we don ' t launch that warp ship tomorrow , there ' s a very good chance that future will never happen . <continued_utterance> you won ' t regret this .
so it would be too much to mention it again . . . <continued_utterance> wow . it ' s the perfect beach house .
i know . my mother doesn ' t know how to do things that aren ' t perfect .

sometimes i think that when you get high or drink or alter your consciousness like that --

<person> !
oh <person> , a pair of pippins ! as round and rare as golden apples !
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ?
then they should be made to .
by whom ? who ' s going to make them ?
<person> !
i would have made you immortal . tell <person> he has lost a new play by <person> shakespeare .
the police have been using everything but radar to locate you .
you ' re to call headquarters at metcalf .
i get the feeling you don ' t want to talk , but will you listen -- ? . whatever grievance you have , whatever quarrel -- surely it doesn ' t involve these children -- still no response .
<person> , here we go .
i don ' t know .

i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . <person> . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
i know the piazza di <person> . what time ?
ten thirty ?
<person> , `` this <person> pisses av gas and farts blackpowder , <person> . ``
thank you for coming , <person> .

what ?
it ' s fucking alive .
i don ' t know wh .
i was looking for <person> ' s book , and i found your tickets . and the note . from your new boss .

and the other half don ' t .
any criminal record ?
probably half a dozen traffic convictions . drunk driving . lost his licence . that ' s why he don ' t work no more . <continued_utterance> can ' t get off that shitty dump they live on . what little money comes in goes to booze .
i ' m sure he won ' t be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him .
<person> , but if i get yelled at , i ' m never gon na listen to this show again .
sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us .
pride ? ! ? <person> , you ' re young , and you don ' t have a very firm grip on politics . i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time .
who is it raped you ?
<person> .
<person> ' fishin ' ?
ah . you ' ve an instinct for character and idiosyncrasy , old son . <continued_utterance> zip yer fly , <person> .

no , i think i read a piece on you in new york magazine .
i guess people find it interesting that i ' ve escaped the noose for so long .
yes , i know who he is .
<person> ' t it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , <person> , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a better conductor than you , then you had von der <person> conscripted into the army and no one ' s heard from him since ?

she was here . she was here , where is she . ? where is she ? she was here -
that won ' t happen , <person> . <person> ' case is small , compared to some of those other guys . the way he told me , all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day , driving behind the bus . i know it ' s a painful thing to do , but it ' ll only take a few minutes of your time . that ' ll be the end of it .
that ' s wrong , <person> . you know that . we ' ll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years . this is never going to go away .
hey , the corn ' s good . really good . not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon . <continued_utterance> it ' ll get there . <person> time to get to know the market . develop a relationship with the buyers . but it ' ll get there . who doesn ' t like popcorn for <person> ' s sake .

my neck ' s a little stiff , that ' s all .
that ' s not what i meant .

it is . i ' m telling you . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff . i just thought you would . i don ' t know , i guess i thought .
yes , you have . where i get hazy , though , is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed , riddled with . <number> caliber bullets . does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence , mr . <person> , or is it just me ?
yes . it does .
you ' re dreamin ' , kid .
<number> <person> . <person> at <number> : <number> , if you ' re interested .
you don ' t smoke .

you ' re welcome . can i take that for you ?
no .
does it cause drowsiness ? that ' s all we need . to get him unconscious -- put him under .
nothing about drowsiness .
that ' s not us .
because you ' ve changed so much .
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it ' s not even worthy of a response . i guess i ' ll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life .
but you don ' t know yet , so your negativity ' s a bit premature , wouldn ' t you say ? <continued_utterance> or fuck those new york publishers . publish it yourself . i ' ll chip in . just get it out there , get it reviewed , get it in libraries . let the public decide . giving <person> a look that says <person> has no idea what he ' s <continued_utterance> <person> ' t come over the top . <person> still .
her husband works a night shift or something , and he comes home , and i ' m on the floor with my cock in his wife ' s ass .
<person> , <person> . <person> . and you walked all the way back from <person> ?
i mean . if you had to guess .
that child is the only friend my son ever had . so she ' s strange , you bet . <continued_utterance> i love that little girl . and i will see to it . that she ' s all right . <continued_utterance> and i don ' t have to guess about it .
it amazes me how little you know yourself .
i ' m incapable of such an act , and so are you .
maybe .
which one of those women is in charge here ?
i ' m sure you ' re good , but all that paper leaves a trail . <person> gets too curious -- fbi , irs , whatever -- that trail ' s gon na lead to somebody .
sure it will . but not to me , and certainly not to the warden .
i will help you . but you have to go to the police and go to jail and -
<person> you send me books and polaroids of you and cassettes ? and letters ?
<person> , i told you i wouldn ' t let you give up your future for me . i ' ll go with you . that way you can continue to protect me , and you won ' t be disobeying your mandate .
what about <person> ?
captain .
i don ' t want to hear anymore about it . i ' m not going , and that ' s final .

<person> woulda burned it . they laugh again . <person> looks at him , stunned .
who ?
except the goddamn skateboards , which are everywhere ! i ' d like to kill the guy who invented those things .
<person> back , <person> .

to the contrary . i want you to tell the truth . the truth is , you can ' t tell me , to a certainty , that you saw the thing . you don ' t remember , a gun to your head , which glasses you have on . and you have a fertile imagination . imagination wants to fill in the blanks . now . if you aren ' t sure , then they have nothing . <person> walks free . as he should . <person> : wasn ' t long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart , you know ? the people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them , we fear them . and they fear us . because we tell the truth . about our lives . now , this is a damn roost , and everyone knows it ; the guy is looking for a case , he wants to make a name for himself . if we let him do that , if we let him do that , then we ' re being false to our community . to our community , you understand ? to our world . cause you are a part of that world , now . you have to take off the steel <person> and put on the gold <person> . and be part of your world . i got a five picture deal with the studio . and you stick with me . you write one , two more , you stick with me , and you ' ll direct the third one . you are a part of this world . you have to do the right thing : we ' re out in the provinces , the sheriff , literally is at our door . you have to stand with the troops , <person> . that ' s the bottom line . you have to . if you had the leisure to think it through , you ' d see it for yourself . the girl wasn ' t in the car .
you ' ll be waiting for me ?
with a wildly beating heart .
well , the coffee cup was layin ' right in the
my gosh , <person> , was i supposed to object every time you did that ? a real . friendly smile . judge that ' s quite enough horseplay , nels , why don ' t you act your age ? <continued_utterance> if i did that <person>onor , i ' d be dead .

i think we ' ve got something , sir . the report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the hoth system , but it ' s the best lead we ' ve had .
we have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy . i want proof , not leads !
what do we use for defense ?
we ' re a habitat . not a castle . the only defense we have is <person> .
<person> , dude , <person> ' s new guy is smart .

oh yeah ? how is it ?
try it .
hey . he didn ' t look like no big time criminal to me . <continued_utterance> eh . the store tells you to call when there ' s trouble , so they won ' t get sued . but that shouldn ' t matter if there ' s a reward , right ?
i wouldn ' t think so .
compared to me she is . how come you ' re not at the cash anymore ? they catch ya steal- ing ?
what ' s it to ya ?
do i need a little makeup ?
you need a hose but you don ' t have the time . it ' s fine that you look like that . it ' s genuine . you can use genuine .

i never went in that sphere .
hey , fuck you , man .
<person> , <person> , easy . preserve a sense of humor at all times . <person> , the receptor rig . what i ' m putting on your head . sends a signal to the recorder . see we call it `` being wired , '' but there ' s no wire . you got ta keep the recorder close . five , six feet away max , like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you ' re going to close escrow , know what i mean ?
so , while we ' re knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty `` stinky '' - in the long run , we ' re going to grow strong from this .
y ' think ?
i think he means it , this time . i think he ' ll deal .
what would it take ?
i feel sorry that i ' m making you buy me a new one .

this isn ' t someone renting limos and fancy dinners on someone else ' s credit . <person> and habits don ' t change .
computer error ?
i remember , <person> ! mr . <person> says he don ' t like no sticky fingers in the till . <continued_utterance> your pop said to put these on his tab . <person> gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .
so <person> , let ' s skedaddle . mr . <person> is waiting . as <person> gets up , theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs .
<person> ? it ' s me .

obi-wan <person> ? i wonder if he means old ben <person> ?
who mam ?
<person> . the man you want to volunteer to help elect president .
you dumb shit . you have to start making passes at the women you ' re supposed to be polling ?

how ?
they were made from a federal prison . this is <person> . he is a lebanese national , serving life without , for kidnapping . he was the head man in a white slavery scheme .
he tortured those people . none of them would tell him anything . he went wild , strung them up and slit their throats . he wanted to tear the place apart , but he was late : he had to get back to reliant in time to blow you to bits .
he came damn close .
<person> . i ' ll log us both on , and you can get your tron thing running .
as long as we stay off the top floor , <person> ' ll never know we ' ve been in here .
you ' re just like you mother ! always jealous !
that ' s why <person> ran away , because you had to control everything !
that ' s a <number> <person> . it ' s really rare . <person> ' t open it now . i ' ve been saving it ! <continued_utterance> for <person> ' s <person> , <person> ! you just wasted like half of it !
<person> up . here ' s to a great week .
are his folks nice ?
you ' ll love them . we ' re going down to d . c . tonight to be with them christmas morning .
every time we have dealings with <person> , i get nervous . we ' re dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon . remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with ? that ' s exactly the --
<person> , kiddo , <person> was many things , but he was never a boy scout .
this is what i ' m saying . he must have had party contacts .
there are good party members who help , and there are dirty non-party members who inform on you . of course , they gave him privileges . <continued_utterance> and suddenly , <person> , suddenly you notice that they like you . they honour you , suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world , for example .
uh , no . not right now , thank you very much .
<person> . man . fuck .
mph mph .

<person> , it ' s so good to see you safe . we were so worried .

while i find that fascinating , <person> , we really need that <person> door open ! the shuttlebay door slides open .
right now .
<person> ! <person> ! <continued_utterance> i ' ve got no problem calling her . <continued_utterance> wait outside , will you ?
i don ' t know .

the force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded . you will find it a powerful ally .
do you really think we ' re going to find a pilot here that ' ll take us to alderaan ?
yeah . this isn ' t working . i ' ve done my best . i ' ve given it five years and fifteen pounds .
what -- you don ' t love me any more ?
come on , we ' re celebrating . i say we pop it .
that ' s a <number> <person> . it ' s really rare . <person> ' t open it now . i ' ve been saving it ! <continued_utterance> for <person> ' s <person> , <person> ! you just wasted like half of it !
we think it might . that ' s why we brought you here . we ' ve assembled your team -- they ' re waiting for us now .

<person> .
<person> ' give me my check .

<person> .
<person> . so don ' t walk near me in public , alright .
mom . ?

he basically dies at the end of the second act , but it ' s very funny .
was hopin ' she ' d give me a reprieve , but .
look who ' s talking . are these your brothers ?
what , all dominicans look the same , now ? <continued_utterance> this is <person> and <person> . up from <person> .
but <person> i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . <person> love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?
when the queen commands it .
maybe she doesn ' t need any . should we check ? <continued_utterance> who are you trying to please ? yourself ? her ? which her , this one or that one . can you face both ? we are in a situation that is beyond morality . so : leave with her . you ' ll see the transformation .
into what ?
no ! that ' s not it . come on . <person> - uh huh ! come on .
you ' re imagining things .
yes , sir !
<person> , close the tunnel . !
she wasn ' t your type anyway .
i think i ' m gon na move <person> .
oh , <person> .
<person> .
and she ' s turned you into a servant .
it was i who asked to come back , humiliating as it may seem . i could have gone on with my career , only i found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me . you see , i was her rirst husband .
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing .
it sure would have made attractive headlines : great star kills her- self for <person> .
what ?
could i have some water ? i ' m cooking in this thing .
i understand you ' re a man who knows how to get things .
i ' m known to locate certain things from time to time . they seem to fall into my hands . maybe it ' s ' cause i ' m irish .
for what ?
not believing you .
<person> , commander donatra of the warbird <person> . might we be of assistance ?
your timing is impeccable , commander .
i knew it ! i had a bet with <person> !
ha .
i think it might hurt her to know .
and his passport photo ? did you hear ? to scratch out your own face like that - can you imagine - the frame of mind you ' d have to be in ? <continued_utterance> well , if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away ? you ' ve been a great friend to my son . everything is someone else ' s fault . we all want to sow wild oars . somebody ' s got to - what ' s the word ? the moment someone confronts him he lashes out . he lashes out . you know , people always say you can ' t choose your parents , but you can ' t choose your children .
there ' s something out there .
where ?
i can ' t be absolutely sure - <number> ? <number> ? we ' d both taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark , it was certainly dark when i walked him down to his car .
so <person> drove away and you did what ?
no .
we want to talk to ya about <person> .
the man most directly responsible is <person> , director of special projects at <person> systems corporation .
why him ?
i know your face , you ' re an up-and-comer . you bowl on the tour .
i ' m not on the tour this year .
i dunno . <person> looks too symmetrical to be a burn . they ' re autopsying her this morning ?
yeah .
so how was the wrestling ?
fantastic ! there was this new wrestler . beat the mighty <person> . you won ' t believe it . a nothing of a guy . calls himself this stupid name . the amazing spider-man . would you believe it ?
only the best ones .
<person> afternoon , <person> . give our respects to <person> and <person> .
i don ' t see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that .
hey , relax guy . it ' s just a cruel joke . <person> , chocolatey <person> are only available up on earth . he ' ll never get ' em , see ?
politics and art must be kept separate . i ' ll remember that . but let me see if you can help me with something i just don ' t understand . i ' d really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him . what ' s his secret ?
well , it ' s hard to explain . i can only tell you from my own experience . soon after i joined the orchestra , we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven , the eroica . there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani . one particular crescendo . during the break , i asked how he wanted it played . he was studying his score . he didn ' t look up . he said , ' just watch me . ' so , of course , i did . i never stopped watching him . the moment came . and suddenly , he turned to me and our eyes were locked . there was something in his look that . that simply demanded the crescendo . i shall never forget his look . it was a moment of . of magic .
was she pretty ?
huh ?
thanks , <person> .
<person> ' you always have to dress like a fuckin ' pimp ?
okay , now she ' s a great chick . must take after the father . which reminds me . <person> , what when can i be up and running in that department ?
i think mr . <person> needs to stay put for another couple of weeks .
that was beer ? !
back off , or we ' ll kick the shit out of you !
you want me to go against a priest ? <person> excommunicated ? you think i ' m nuts ?
you bastard !
okay , <person> , look , i ' m gon na dial <number> and you ' re not gon na move . <person> , hand me the phone .
you don ' t understand . i ' m a friend of your daughter ' s .
yeah . well . i don ' t think he wants me to find him . well , i ' d better be going .
this flash . he isn ' t your boyfriend , is he ?
i ' ll wait at vt station . five o ' clock every day until you come . <continued_utterance> i love you .
so what , <person> ? so what ? now , get out and tell your no- good agency not to send anybody else until they ' ve learnt to cook . you hear ?
not on the same floor with <person> !
just follow me . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t bend back like that .
<person> ! are you sure ? maybe the scanner ' s out of adjustment --
i suppose it <continued_utterance> you know what she ' ll say .
i can ' t . it ' s black tie .
i have black tie from a time i went to the rainbow room . have you ever been to the rainbow room ?

<person> on . let me get rid of this call . <continued_utterance> <person> ?
i have no plans to call on you , clarice , the world being more interesting with you in it . be sure you extend me the same courtesy .
you know i can ' t make that promise .
what about talking to this sheik ?
you don ' t think they ' ve got guys talking to the sheik ? except the sheik isn ' t talking .
he ' s as big as <person> , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he ' s probably <person> and <person> rolled into one .
<person> , and i never heard of him .
for the bloody stuff .
so , how much is this ?
you ought to be used to me by now .
i ' m used to you .
why so briefly ?
i - ran away .

the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since <number> together with their questionnaires . <person> , what am i to tell dr . <person> ?
you tell him nothing , <person> . if he calls again , you say you know nothing . we ' re gon na keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses . and , <person> help me , with <person> .
that ' s what he said .
what are you up to , <person> ?
so you ran away .
no . first i tried to free them . i opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn ' t run . they just stood there , confused . they wouldn ' t run .
it couldn ' t sound crazier , but who else ?

<person>r , what you should be finding . is a nice girlfriend .
<person> , <person> ' s a sweetie .
is she sleeping or . ?
as stories must when love ' s denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder . <continued_utterance> <person> , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it ' s time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
fifty shillings . pounds .
no , thank you .
<person> -- i never meant to hurt you .
sometimes i think i might ' ve been better at it .
interesting . it ' s kind of a drag in a lot of ways . you like guys ?
the prosecutor , the judge , cut her off . she was desperate . her husband helpless . i was helpless . <continued_utterance> you couldn ' t let her . be helpless . <continued_utterance> when this verdict is read . she may look for your face . <continued_utterance> here ' s what she needs to see : this is nothing . we win it on appeal .

i ' m delighted to meet you at last . we have a great deal to discuss , senator . i hope you can keep your young jedi under control .

come now , a big , strapping fellow like you ? what are you afraid of ?
people . are a cynical lot .
i think she just couldn ' t get enough love .
we weren ' t close . but we were connected . in a bad way .
you know something , i think we ' re saying the same thing . look as long as we ' re doing closure . what did you and my husband , <person> , do last night ?
he ' d never give it to me .
<person> here .
eight by thirty <person> . no marks on the objectives . <person> bloom .

a systems analyst i met . very hot jewish guy .
what are you , the new middle east ambassador ? it ' s two-thirty .

the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell .
new year ' s eve . i ' ll do it , okay ?

i have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely . in staying here , i believed i walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows . you seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t directly oppose the <person> because i told myself , that was not my job . if i had taken any active part in politics i could not have remained here . but as a musician , i am more than a citizen . i am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies . i know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of buchenwald and auschwitz than words .
have you ever smelled burning flesh ? i smelt it four miles away . four miles away , i smelt it . have you ever seen the gas chambers , the crematoria ? have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses ? you talk to me about culture , art and music ? you putting that in the scales , <person> ? you setting culture , art and music against the millions put to death by your pals ? they had orchestras in the camps . they played <person> , <person> . the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families . i don ' t understand the germans ' relationship with music . what do you need music for ? your pals you could call to save a few <person> when millions of them were being annihilated ? yes , i blame you for not getting hanged , i blame you for your cowardice . you strutted and swaggered , you fucking piece of shit , king-pin in a shithouse . you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows , and i say to you , lies !

the <person> system .
<person> system . there ' s not much there .

that ' s <person> ' s dog . perhaps he ' s come to beat the shit out of you - good !

<person> , that ' s great -- it just so happens though , that i met . <person> , and much to my delight , not only is she alive , but she ' s female . i thought i told you . <person> looks at <person> , very suspiciously . he looks back at her , and tries to smile , pretending that he is having a pleasant , and completely irrelevant conversation .
i have to .
where ? and don ' t tell me <person> .
yes . little . secondaria ?
high school ?
commander , we are receiving . this is regula i . go ahead .
dr . <person> . good . we ' re en route to you and should be there in three days .

and <person> was followed in office by .
no , no , really . obviously you ' ve got things you have to do . you ' ve got to dismember the rest of his bloody torso . dig a makeshift shallow grave . cover the body with quick lime . really so much to do , so little time and i ' m only in the way here , i ' m just gon na go . <person> luck .
oh , this ! oh , no , this is what he stole . this isn ' t a piece of him or anything . this is <person> .

i don ' t know , but whatever it is , it ' s only six hours away .
the planetary conjunction ?
i rejoiced at his death because i thought it was yours . that is all i know of <person> .
it ' s true , <person> -- it was a tavern brawl <person> attacked , and got his own knife in the eye . a quarrel about the bill
that is because you have a familiarity with them . you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge .
yes . and , frankly , i envy them as well . they ' ve made important choices ; they ' re going to have great challenges ahead of them . new worlds to conquer . <continued_utterance> seeing <person> and <person> today made me think about some of the choices i ' ve made in my own life . devoting myself to <person> . not marrying or having children . all the choices that led me here .
this may take a lot more than extra practice .
well , i don ' t know what else you expect . i ' ll go out and do my best . if that ' s not enough , it ' s not enough .
i asked <person> but she was busy tonight and you ' re the next best thing . i mean , it isn ' t that you ' re the next best thing but because you play her , it feels comforting . does that make sense ? although the thing is offstage you ' re nothing like her . you play her very well though . did <person> mention what she was doing tonight because i called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn ' t going to be back till late and i thought that was weird because she told me <person> was sick .
she ' s going to dinner with <person> .
thanks a lot . no respect from my offspring --

i don ' t know , <person> . i ' m not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when <person> came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page <number> . how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page <number> talks about a giant squid .
i come there and you ' ll have the cops waiting .

<person> . i know what you think about the wire . but i ' m asking you to do this . it ' s that important . <continued_utterance> <person> this has to be your first playback . <continued_utterance> keep your eyes closed , or you ' ll see double .
i wanted to tell you . that first day . that ' s why i --
you knew this whole time ?
no , that ' s free . he ' s an architect . used to do big high-profile projects . he scaled it all back when his wife died . now he remodels people ' s homes . he works in a small firm , makes a good living .
he ' s real .
i was alone in the car . i was driving .
well , now , mr . <person> , i ' m very sorry , in fact , i ' m as sorry as i could be , but .
i know , <person> . and it ' s not just that . <person> at the things people are doing . partners killing each other . i mean , you hear a story like that , and . who can you really trust these days ?
what do you mean ?
first oboe .
i have your questionnaire here . it says you were never a member of the nazi party .
<person> for the yankees . i know him brother . and you ?
<person> .
do you think this is wrong ?
the best part was that there was a ' this ' . to debate the wrongness of . <continued_utterance> your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .
but you ' re only saying that ' cause you think he and i have had sex .
yes . <person> your voice . <person> ' t you ?
in his apartment -
and where was his wife ?
<person> is <number> % complete , ma ' am .
<person> as she goes , <person> <number> .
yes . yes , you are .
and by the way , <person> does not live here anymore . <continued_utterance> and tell the professor he can ' t have <person> ' s data . <person> .
<person> was excited . he didn ' t mean it exactly the way it ' s stated here .
how did you mean it . ?
no . because you like me so much .
<person> . i like your obnoxiousity .
my telephone .
<person> has some news for you , <person> .
<person> . and did we know each other ?
well , i knew you , so i suppose you must have known me .
no , i replotted the course . it ' s more efficient this way .
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?
you ' ll back me up with some paperwork ? then i ' ll try . but wouldn ' t this have more weight coming from the senator herself ?
she doesn ' t know what we ' re up to . and we can ' t afford to let her find out . <continued_utterance> she ' s the mother , starling . she can ' t possibly comprehend what <person> is . she ' d make the mistake of pleading with him . begging him . he ' d feast on her pain till the last second of that girl ' s life .
the truth is that it was an accident , and no one ' s to blame .
there ' s no such thing as an accident , <person> . not in a situation like this .
i know .
i ' ve never admitted that to anyone .
i do not wish to remove the chip , sir . although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with . i can not imagine going back to a life without them . i have taken an important step toward becoming truly human . if i were to turn back now . i would like to continue in my duties , sir .
courage is an emotion too , <person> . now . can you project the course of the ribbon ?
it ' s mine .
who gave it to you ?
neither could i . i think it ' s <person> .
oh , look . there ' s <person> !

you can have a quid .
oh you ' re a tight fucker aren ' t ya ?

what ' s wrong with <person> ?
i think we sort of found each other . <person> smiles enigmatically . <person> registers . peter where ' s <person> ' s father ?
he ' s not coming till the morning . evidently his stomach - i don ' t think the food here is agreeing with him .
<person> , that or maybe plant your toy in somebody ' s skull ?
i have no enemies here .
we ' re dead ! they showed this prison movie to my youth group on sunday .
<person> , we ' ve .

it ' s not a bad thing to say ' women your age ' .

<person> . can you get her ?

we serve here only moka coffee .

we plunge it ! we plunge it !
what ' s he got against me . i mean , i ' m a teenager . you can ' t be a citizen when you ' re only a teenager !
it ' s not you , <person> . your parents are rich they don ' t need to be citizens , and that stuff means a lot to my dad . he ' s a veteran .
you ' re a doctor , huh ?
just a very sick man .
if the head was moving fast enough , but i don ' t see how it could be .
is it possible ?
<person> says you help keep the park clean , sweep up , that sort of thing . i ' m sure it won ' t be so bad . besides , a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school you ' ll be going to . you can start the school year with some ready-made friends .
i had friends in oceanside . i had something to do for the summer .
i do not want to .
<person> ' t be afraid . i ' d really like to hear it . <continued_utterance> please .

i checked the passenger manifest of the lakul . guess who else was on board ?
and professionally ?
i ' m not sure . it started with <person> . he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door . he covered the video lens . obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown . i don ' t know why he didn ' t tell us he had somebody in there . by this time , we were getting visitors , too . he was desperately trying to figure it out . day and night . who was she ?
i have lost my gift .
you left it in my bed . come to look for it again .
it seems to be a redundant memory port . maybe it ' s for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload ?
dr . <person> must have found it unnecessary in later versions .
we ' re-going out to dinner . you ' ll come .
out to dinner ?
you still getting dizzy ?
not as much .
i ' m not being unpatriotic , and i ' m doing my damndest to catch them . bell ' s up on <number> and i ' m down here on <number> past grand junction . they ' re heading west . if they ' re not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them . all i ' m asking is that you people think about it .

you can ' t quit even if you want to and you know why .
<person> is my prisoner . i want to see him .
the prisoner is being interrogated .
oh and i don ' t because i have a children ? ! the problem is you ' re too self-involved to ever be a mother .
maybe the problem is your kids . maybe they ' re spoiled , coddled brats !
all i know is <person> ' s going to be a citizen,
<person> . how excruciatingly pathetic . now try and pay attention .
no .
was he drinking ? could you tell ?
it didn ' t stop you from loving them . right ? or understanding them , or being able to forgive them .

uncharted . we ' ll have to get closer for a more detailed scan .
theories ?
what are you talking about you prick ?
mugging off <person> , saying that he ' s getting weak , losing all his gear .
i think so .
<person> . now there ' s a lot of secrecy in all of this , and you have your reasons for that .
you can ' t chuck us out .

my father .
it ' s a great honour to meet you , fraulein . your father was a great patriot . <continued_utterance> dr . <person> is a great musician . he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape .

ah , ah , ah .
if misspelled .

only if you let it . the fact of the money shouldn ' t get in-
having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes life boats . but the friend gets very touchy if you say one word : life boat . well , that ' s two words . we were afraid our south african friend might say `` you only love me for my . life boats ? '' but we like <person> .

i ' m <person> . they ' ll train you for the games , but . well , i hope you make it okay . hey , what ' s going on in the other sectors ? i ' ve been stuck in this grid for <number> microcycles .
it ' s murder out there . you can ' t even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that <person> creep . hauling me down here to play games . who does he calculate he is ? if only <person> was still around . <continued_utterance> you ever see that guy in action ? hundred-percent independent . mcp couldn ' t tell him what to -- he stops . <person> is looking over his shoulder . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ? what did i say ?

. there are all different ways you can tell that there ' s someone really there watching out for us . you see signs . sometimes they ' re little ones . you think of someone . the phone rings . they ' re on the phone . sometimes they ' re big , like fourteen lights hovering over mexico city . sure , there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing . but there are a lot of people watching this , who think it ' s a miracle . a sign of god ' s existence . it ' s all in how you look at things <person> . what you have to decide is what kind of person you are ? are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes , things just happen by chance ?
so what do you write ?
lesbian crime .
a vote ?
of course . <person> , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing <person> to select a program ?

long story . his goons will be here any minute . we ' ve got to get you out of here ' - now !
i can ' t go with you .
of course , when we return , we ' ll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth . we ' ll chalk it up to isolation , collective derangement .
i ' ve never heard you express any desire to leave before now . why now ?
and you are gaining five thousand pounds , my lord by these drafts in my hand .
would you oblige me with fifty or so in gold ? -- just to settle my accounts at the dockside ? <continued_utterance> ah ! -- look , she comes !
up in the air ? was
we discussed that . and decided not to .
i am . i was just . i just got . i think i got nervous . it ' s normal , right ? <person> ' t you ever feel nervous about , you know ?
what ?
no , i ' m alright . my scholarship covers almost everything , and i sell some photos here and there . today my physics professor asked for some of my work . he wants to study my data . they might publish my work in the science magazine .
publish your work ? ! you hear that may . ?
yes but . what about the guests ?
mary ' s got <person> to help .
i wasn ' t in the car .
we know that you weren ' t .
it seemed to me a good idea -- what with all this rustling going on --
who ' d ever try driving cattle over table-top ? -- unless they were crazy .
i ' ll go and see what ' s the matter .
i ' ll go .
and who is this ?
he ' s a user , <person> . he came to our world . trying to help us .
i thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to coruscant .
<person> , you ' re right , you ' re right .
i can ' t feel her bones . she ' s like a sponge .
she was crushed . feel her skin -- it ' s like sandpaper .
why ' d he hit you ?
i wrecked his sixty-five <person> and his boat in the same week .
no . here is a pattern . two days ago <person> is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered . yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks , and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november <number> th . we look at hotel records and we see <continued_utterance> <number> people .
<number> people .
hey , how ' d it go with that girl the other night ?
girl ?
<person> . i ' ll pay it .
i have no idea where he got on .
throw me his ball .
<person> shot .
does <person> say that ?
here ' s dinner . all ready .
make love to you --
you didn ' t kiss me -- i suppose ?
i see they sold that house across the street . i bet they ' ll come knocking on your door soon .
they can knock all they want . <person> , wait , whaddaya doing ? <person> ' t put the lime sticker on the cheddar can . maybe i better just do this myself .
high school . remember ? run a flip six , three hole play , and you might score .
cover me .
what kind of gun did he have ?
the kind that puts really big holes in people .
whatever . some summer .
promise me you ' ll give it a try . please ?
<person> , dad . see you , <person> .
i don ' t want you around <person> anymore . get me ?
not both my folks . just my <person> .
aha . trouble in paradise ?
what is it ?
you know that accident up there ?
right .
so , take it off .
i shooed him away ! the police said it was an accident but .
it wasn ' t your fault !
just in our building -- if you feel up to it .
yea !
i hate when he uses the word `` superfluous '' . i mean , we needed two million and we hadn ' t seen <person> in a long time and while <person> might not have the price of a dinner he easily might have two million dollars .
the currents last night were very churny .
it ' s no biggie . <continued_utterance> it ' s just an assignment .
it ' s <person> , you should be doing it .
so you ' re real name ' s <person> ?
no . i just said <person> was a better name than <person> .
can you mix a martini ?
sure .
huh .
i ' m sorry , <person> . so i don ' t know where that leaves us . i ' m not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it . i think it ' s one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home . the whole industry ' s gotten gutless . it ' s not about the quality of the books . it ' s about the marketing . <person> is at a loss for words . a distant rumble begins to sound , the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack .
i ' m sorry .
i don ' t like you either . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t insult us . you just watch yourself . we ' re wanted men . i have the death sentence in twelve systems .
i ' m not going to call every five minutes , but this is important .
<person> , i ' m just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding . <person> ' t that the point of this ? <person> ' t that what we talked about with dr . <person> ?
any change in surface scan ?
negative . <person> atmosphere , dominated by craylon gas , sand and high velocity winds . incapable of supporting life forms .
uh , what does that mean , `` the hammer '' ?
my daddy always said , `` when you want to insert a nail in a piece of wood , you don ' t do nothing fancy or glamorous , you don ' t finesse or play the hero , you just pick up your damn hammer and hit that sumbitch till it ' s in . ``
<person> is utterly dismayed .
i get it from his point of view . he ' s always been a cheating wanker . he loves having his cake and eating it - but since when did your standards drop so low ? you could have anyone .
what happened to that , is that you ' re too stupid to get into the schools i did !
i was not too stupid , i was too lazy !
what ' s <person> . ?
. that ' s where we clean them up . we ship them rough , we make them <person> , and everybody ' s happy .
oh , yes . they were alike in many ways . <person> individual thinkers . idealists .
interesting . i ' m still not sure i understand .
<person> drunk .
mebbe i am drunk -- mebbe that ' s why i ' m tellin ' the truth -- i ' m drunk an ' i ' ll say what i think -- i ' ll say what i know . <person> , on the floor , takes up <person> ' s belligerent mood for a flash .
then where do i put the people waiting for a table ? it won ' t work .
do this for me .
<person> ' t you see how <person> ' s looking at you ? you got her on the hook . reel her in ! come on , let ' s rachet this up a notch . you know how to to do it . here . <person> some agua . <person> looks at the water , takes it and drains it .
should we get dessert ?
<person> kissing . kissing off .
<person> ' t look that way - you know - from a distance .
what are you saying ?
destroy life . <person> is . insignificant . bags of sleepy , sluggish flesh . what would you say ?
you told me that about the last town .
<person> , but they never made a movie here .
um , i feel a lot of longing .
hmm . beg a girl , why dontcha .
who got their heads cut ?
uh , <person> , fella , <person> .
some kind of virus . they ' re stripping it all out .
<person> .
what do you think ?
ain ' t made up my mind yet .
two days . an hour or so .
no way . we ' re a choir , right ? headliners . the big room . two days a week won ' t cut it . every day .
same reason i put explosives around the habitat . for defense . for the power . to protect myself .
<person> what ? <person> ' s unconscious .
i ' m afraid i haven ' t time to listen .
it ' s so simple , too . a couple of fellows meet accidentally , like you and me . no connection between them at all . <person> saw each other before . each of them has somebody he ' d like to get rid of , but he can ' t murder the person he wants to get rid of . he ' ll get caught . so they swap murders .
i like griftin ' .
you could buy yourself some things .
i told them what you said about the script .
would you like to see it ? i ' ve got the key back at my store .
thank you .
will you join me for a little refreshment ? <continued_utterance> everyone ' s invited , of course . <continued_utterance> having trouble with you droid ?

st . <person> ' s ?
<person> , you ' re my friend . i need you . plus i ' ll give you <number> % of what i make tonight .
<person> , this may be a hard concept for you , but friends don ' t have to pay their friends . <continued_utterance> <person> , you ' re pathetic . <person> , i got a pickup at the st . <person> . i ' ll take you there , you can get a cab .
ah . no .
ah no .
<person> . <person> turns . <continued_utterance> i just . the truth is . i don ' t know how to be a boyfriend .
that ' s what you have to say after all this ? you don ' t know how to be a boyfriend .
i suggest you ask <person> that yourself . <person> ' s is on delle <person> , just off the corso .
is it on
i don ' t like you either . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t insult us . you just watch yourself . we ' re wanted men . i have the death sentence in twelve systems .
i ' ll be careful than .
yes . but until then , you ' ll have to make do with what you ' ve got .
that ' ll be interesting .
<person> , you ' ve really grown up into a fine-looking woman .
i don ' t feel very fine-looking .
i ' ll need ten minutes , sir , ' til the radiation dissipates .
<person> , send to commander , <person> : prepare to be boarded .
i went to live with my mother ' s cousin and her husband in montana . they had a ranch .

<person> , well i ' ll be at junior college where the girls are half as smart , and thus twice as likely to blow me .
what are you guys doing tonight ?
mrs . <person> ' s clothing .
does it fit ?
but why ?
because this movie has naughty language , and it might make you kids start using bad words .
that means you don ' t want me to ?
no , i was asking if you wanted to .
yes .
what does it matter then ? <continued_utterance> do you know what <person> ' s last words were before they killed her ? <continued_utterance> she said , `` see '' , and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said . `` tell <person> to swing away . `` <person> ' s mouth opens a bit . <person> turns and chuckles at his expression . <continued_utterance> do you know why she said that ? <continued_utterance> because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died , and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head . there is no one watching out for us <person> . we ' re all on our own .
she is like that .
<person> , i know what to believe and what not to . i ' m not that easily fooled .
why lie ?
<person> and <person> , that ' s just too good gossip , isn ' t it ?
<person> idea .

your husband came home agitated , after his encounter with the deceased ?
i said ' excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .
my instincts tell me you ' re lying . and i know that can ' t be easy for you . i can see you have a good heart . <continued_utterance> oh . i forgot to tell you . while you were unconscious , i injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream . it ' s been navigating your cardiovascular system . and right now i ' ve attached it to your left ventricle . a little trick i picked up from the borg .
yeah . they ' re full of great ideas .

jules ! i just got in a cab and i ' m going to the liquor store as we speak .
<person> . i can ' t wait for you to get here .

it will be human and it will look like this . but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know . that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have .
i told you it ' s impossible for me to have a baby .
`` <person> thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . <person>ly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ``
`` it was the lark , the herald of the morn , no nightingale . <person> , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east . <person> ' s candles are burnt out , and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . i must be gone and live , or stay and die . `` the words of the scene become will ' s and viola ' s , their way of saying the farewells they can not utter .
what ?
about forever .
hiya , <person> .

these cards --
anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession ?
<person> shit ! how ' d you get here ?
on a airplane , motherfucker .
i thought of calling you .
<person> !
it says nothing of this in the guide book .
with respect , <person> , the guide book is written by a bunch of lazy , good-for-nothing , indian beggars .
<person> , i know you ' re tired , but can you drop me at the retinal fetish ?
<person> , <person> .
your powers are weak , old man .
you can ' t win , <person> . if you strike me down , i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine . their lightsabers continue to meet in combat .

i was in space for a long time . then a ship belonging to the `` talosians '' picked me up . they asked me where i came from . i told them people called the `` pakleds '' took me from my homeworld . they are fat . <person> groans . time passes . <continued_utterance> then i opened my eyes and saw you .
you really should . <person> , after all , is really just a series of challenges .

`<person> i will ' , like , `yeah i will ' like last time ? please come .
where ' d you get this , anyway .
why ?
i can ' t . forget the baby . <person> ? the closest i was able to get you was <person> . you ' ll have to hitchhike the rest of the way .
why do you ask ?
i ' ve seen a lot of suspicious- looking people around here today .
at the big apple circus , it ' s the only big top i know . i said i ' d get ' em back tonight .
<person>,
he ' s talented and confused and he ' s not a lowlife . and i love him because he ' s alive ! he ' s the most alive person i ' ve ever known .
when he looks at you , all he sees is u money . he doesn ' t give a damn about you . <continued_utterance> i ' m warning you , young lady . you marry him -- no ' card-a-terias ' !
he ' s nice . he ' s available . he fucks me without crying .
that happened one time ! you fucked him ?
she intends to change the future somehow .
i guess , yeah -- oh shit ! !
a fist . my stepdad socked me . i flew across the room and dented the sheetrock in the kitchen . my mom saw everything and still took his side .
you got cracked good .
of course you did ! we were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it ! that ' s the definition of bailing !
if you said we should burn our dicks off and i didn ' t , that ' s not bailing !
really ?
sing me a song , yaar . how about <person> , huh ? my favourite .
you ' ve got nothing , you don ' t have a witness .
and i ' ve got a witness ! your mr . <person> saw the crime .

no shit that ' s fucked up . here i am this little kid who can ' t stop drawing dicks to save his life .
but there ' s nothing to . you ' re talking like a nut , that ' s what people will say . this is just a body , it doesn ' t prove anything .
no , it doesn ' t .
a hair .
this one ?
no i ' m not . i ' m not star --

i have your oatmeal , honey .
i want peanut butter and jelly .

how much for everything .
your photos suck . <person> , my readers are morons . i got ta grab them by the eyes . every time you press the button of that nikon of yours it costs you fifty-five cents . so the next time you ' re about to take the plunge , ask yourself , am i taking dog bites man ?
i know , i know . you want man bites dog .
it ' s compensation , <person> , for the marginal life we lead . <person> , did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
that ' s right ! tell him , so i can read it in hunsecker ' s column first !
let me be the judge of that . <continued_utterance> there ' s an amazing thing when a woman has a daughter . one day you look up , and you see . a sister . someone . you can say . anything to . <continued_utterance> i wrote a whole lot of letters . to each of you . and the envelope says when to open it . like , which birthday . or . when you get your driver ' s permit . first time you see rome . things like that . <continued_utterance> <person> ' s for awhile , okay ? until he ' s old enough to not open them all at once .
until he ' s old enough to read . tears on <person> ' s face . her mom wonders .
gosh , you look nice .

an individual more like you , you mean .
<person> ' plastic over her face . <person> thinkin ' , <person> .
what do we do now ?
all the roads into <person> are blocked . we ' d like to talk to you .

just seeing how you ' re doing . and , um , <person> and i were starting to look over the seating charts again , and we ' re wondering if you wanted <person> to sit next to the feldmans , or should he be at one of the singles tables ? <continued_utterance> so what do you think ? with the feldmans ?
yeah . the feldmans .
oh
and that was only my first try .
yes .
so what is it ?
and we all went through that together ? on ben . oh my god . he knew it !

sometimes . the lucky ones get sent to <person> . <continued_utterance> friend of the receptionist , missing for about a year now . i told her i ' d let her know if the body ever turned up .
the receptionist .
i can ' t . hold on ! spidey thwips her and she grabs onto the web .
<person> tight , <person> , hold tight !
what else you got on his followers .
clearly , they ' re committed .
what do you mean ?
it was right after <person> showed up . i was upset . <person> came up to me -- and i said something like : you ' re crazy to get married . it just came out . <continued_utterance> do you think it was totally the reason ?
your clones are very impressive .
i ' m just a simple man , trying to make my way in the universe , <person> .
<person> . when do we get our payment ?
this contains all the information you ' ll need to build a trilithium weapon . it ' s been coded . once i ' m safely to the surface , i ' ll transmit the decryption sequence to you . not before .
i don ' t care about the money . i just want to work again . you don ' t know what it means to know that you want me .
nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible .
it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .
<person> na be good as new .
<person> ' n new , cause it ' s got a story . want to do the other part ?
i didn ' t get any . they ' re not letting anyone in . they ' re arresting someone or something .
well , they ' ll be arresting somebody else if you don ' t do something quick . ow ! my shoulder ! it ' s killing me .
there ' s the rub .
there ' s the rub .
i ' ll keep in touch .
no , you won ' t .
fifty fucking thousand !
fifty-five ? <continued_utterance> <person> ? <person> to our colorful bidder ?
i got something much healthier for you than that .
what is it ?
would you follow her through an airport ?
look , i met somebody . she ' s good , and capable and smart . we hit it off . we can ' t spend your life chasing after fantasies .
but <person> said she saw a dog and tried to .
how long has <person> been driving that bus , mr . <person> ? how many times has she steered clear of danger ? what went wrong that morning ? <continued_utterance> <person> calculated ahead of time what it would cost to sacrifice safety . it ' s the darkest , most cynical thing to imagine , but it ' s <continued_utterance> absolutely true . and now , it ' s up to me to make them build that bus with an extra bolt , or add an extra yard of guard rail . it ' s the only way we can ensure moral responsibility in this society . by what i do .
he had to make a phone call .
so what are you up to today , <person> ?
too nice ! ?
yes , <person> ' re my captain for gods sakes . <person> should be constantly on my case , like the captain on <person> and hutch . once a week you should routinely haul my ass into your office , accuse me of being a maverick and complain to me that you ' re sick and tired of defending my screwball antics to the commissioner .
yeah . mr . excitement .
tell me somethin ' , we haven ' t actually had sex yet , have we ?
something you want to see in there ?
-- no .
i ' d like to put in an announcement of my parents forty-fifth wedding anniversary .
sure , it ' s $ <number> . <number> per word , and you ' ve got a choice of standard or bold .
<person> acted in a cough syrup commercial . he thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic . he said the play sucked big time .
i know every child is special in their own way , but <person> sounds like a punk . i thought the play was excellent .
no idea .
well , press something !
what are they ?
eggs .
max .
hey , <person> , what ' s wrong with <person> ? i can hear him barking . is he okay ? <continued_utterance> your foster parents are dead . <person> ' s go .
a moth . how did you predict that ?
i ' m waiting for your offer , <person> . enchant me .
would you like to sit for a moment , mrs . <person> ?
yes dear , i think i would .
it takes time --
absolutely . when i come back , maybe the two of us should spend some time together , on our own . what do you think ?
i don ' t deal black-jack clips ! it ' s policy . i got ethics here .
<person> , when did that start ? come on , man ! it ' s what people want to see , and you know it .
you mean you ' ve known about <person> all this time ? <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .
since the first night . he gave me her glasses .
i can ' t stay here . i want to go home . i don ' t want this skin . i don ' t want to look like this .
why don ' t you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late ?
i need a sample of your blood . what do your borg friends say ? resistance is futile . <continued_utterance> yes . the bait you couldn ' t refuse . i learned there might be an existing prototype from a cardassian historian , then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on <person> . i knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the enterprise the closest ship to romulus when i contacted <person> .
all of this so you could capture me ?
your ex-partner . i ' m buying you out , <person> . read the contract .
fuck the contract !
i ' m a hemotologist , not a detective .
. or from the cut on his hand . which is more probable ?
when you ' re in one of these moods you do not drive well and i do not want to be killed today .
we could have been killed last night .
i ' ve never had the time of my life .
i know . and bubbee , i say this from the deepest part of my heart . . .
i like your work .
thanks . what are you looking for ?
as well you should .
i read the <person> .
who ' s he ?
also a conductor . <person> brilliant . <person> . von der <person> called him ' the miracle von <person> ' . <person> was outraged and they say he had von der <person> conscripted into the army . the same thing happened to another critic . true or not , it ' s not such a bad idea . critics give you bad reviews , you have them sent to the russian front . but if you really want to get <person> , ask him about <person> von <person> .
that is true . however , i believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse . for thirty-four years i have endeavored to become more `` human '' - to grow beyond my original programming . and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor . this emotion chip is the only answer .
all right . <continued_utterance> but at the first sign of trouble , i ' m going to deactivate it . agreed ?
about a month ago . six weeks .
to that guy ? that guy with the restaurant .
i ' m sorry , <person> . it ' s impossible to deny you ' ve . . that you ' ve grown up .
<person>aster obi-wan manages not to see it .
<person> , au cas ou nous prende un desset ou devrions jefaire quelgue chose ?
laissons quelque chose d ' achat . et ce grand gateau de chocolat ?
a lot artists don ' t like to title their work . they feel it biases the viewer .
it is titled . it ' s called `` i dunno '' .
some other party .
so what about the good-looking one ? <continued_utterance> official shooting script as of <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
the secret service ?
that ' s right , that ' s right . they know who i am . you . they ' ve `` cleared '' me .
this is a world war two mitchell cannon nose bomber .
you make all these models ?
what are you going to do now ?
i got some ideas . i was thinking maybe we could -- norah shakes her head .
that ' s sweet but i can ' t , i ' m writing .
oh . <person> . you ' re not really writing are you ?
you want to draw a picture ?
a sketch . i can sketch him . i ' m very good .
i ask a question ? why ' d you do it ?
i ' m innocent , remember ? just like everybody else here . <continued_utterance> what are you in for , <person> ?
<person> , it ' s just that .
i understand .
- <person> himself- a man of great standing and integrity- said the kid was a liar and a cheat . what more do you need ?
a liar . <continued_utterance> indeed , sir .
so he ' s in heaven ? <continued_utterance> maybe we could let her use our cb and she could talk to him . <continued_utterance> maybe he would hear her .
maybe .
do you know what ' s in this archive ?
how could i know what ' s in the archive ?
that doesn ' t matter anymore . i just lost a hundred dollars of <person> ' money !
we have to help him !
who is this ?
oh my god ! <person> ! oh , shit . <person> , i ' m sorry . i thought you were . can i talk to <person> ?
i didn ' t find the bomber . you fooled me with the middle eastern guy . i went for the diversion . what kind of freaky simulation is this ? let me out of here !
<person> guy ? be specific .
i can explain .
<person> promised me he would never take off this ring .
it ' s brand new .
trust me .
oh , you are a loser .
i was twenty . my mates thought i was cradle snatching . and they used to call her <person> .
what do you think ' s going on ?
could be anything .
just . because .
<person> final jawab ?
what -- <person> ?
your wife has quite a sense of humor .
i ' ll get a dewars rocks .
bud .
it ' s not enough . for hospital bills . for <person> .
i ' ll help pay for <person> , if that ' s what you ' re really talking about . i ' ll even give you the money i got for my kids . that ' s what we used to do , remember ? help each other . this was a community .
uh . ok , i guess . kind of a tie . <continued_utterance> page <number> of <number>
well , i think you ' re going to take care of that tomorrow morning . in fact , i ' ve planned a little celebration in advance . we ' re going to this incredible party up in the foothills at some friends of mine .
from <person> . what ' s wrong ?
he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there . it would kind of save us a honeymoon .
i got married because <person> said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
then give me the combined air and <person> .
one moment , sir .
why ?
you know . where ' s your bathroom ?
. or from the cut on his hand . which is more probable ?
it is not my function . to weigh those probabilities .
postmortem ?
yes , exactly , but his first , his first conclusion was that <person> was killed not later than seven o ' clock yesterday evening .
i ' m suddenly quite happy to be going back .
that ' s good .
about my data i bet .
i don ' t know .
so when was this engagement ?
long time ago . she was just this adorable lanky girl from kentucky with the greatest pair of legs i ' d ever seen . never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them .
well , you looked at your watch and said it wasn ' t late for you . i wondered who it was late for .
not me . no , <person> . not here . maybe it is late . <continued_utterance> look , the truth is , yes , i had a great time , and i ' d like to kiss you , but if we do kiss , then we ' ll kiss on the couch and if we kiss on the couch , then we ' ll kiss in the bedroom , and once you ' re in the bedroom -- well , the thing is , i always rush it . and this time i feel like maybe i should wait . maybe we should let it build naturally and grow , instead of just immediately spending the night together .
yes . that ' s the first thing <person> asked too .
she ' s talking . <person> ambulance is she in ?
how ?
same way i found <person> , and speck , and <person> . and you . that rang a bell . <continued_utterance> i need someplace quiet - someplace i can concentrate . and your assurance that once he ' s located , we go get him together .
cwe ? whose initials ? not the victim ' s .
no . i called the school and had someone find them in a yearbook . here ' s the original owner ' s name . but it could have been through a dozen pawn shops since then .
<person> .
come away with me .
yeah . you probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn ' t have to drive us home .
. definitely .
<person> ! do me a speech , do me a line .
`` parting is such sweet sorrow `` henslowe has been overhearing .
this is to be a very important picture . i have written it myself . <person> me years .
looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures .
<person> ?
it ' s obvious this fellow <person> is impressed with you . he hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up . he ' s young , not terribly bright . not surprising he didn ' t know what a state he ' d put you in .
<person> ' t wear the beige one .
this guy ' s probably a schmuck and i don ' t care what i wear . <continued_utterance> you think the beige ?
there isn ' t time for that . in other words , you don ' t know .
no .
i will . and i ' ll return . i promise .
told you , i did . <person> is he . now matters are worse .
the accent ! i ' ve got it : this guy is in the pay of a foreign government .
i ' ve got to run along . thanks any- way for your interest in my career .
we ' ve established that . just tell me about his clothing then . <continued_utterance> was he wearing a scottish kilt or jeans ? <continued_utterance> let me ask you two something . <person> ' t be embarrassed by the answer . it is possible . just possible now , you might have been chasing each other around ? you said you went in opposite directions .
<person> , it sounds as strange to me saying it , as it is to you hearing it . but we couldn ' t see him . he stayed mostly in the shadows . all we could make out was movement . but i ' ll tell you something with absolute certainty . there was someone watching our house last night . he was looking in my children ' s windows and i want you to find him <person> . i need you to take this seriously , just incase , it is something serious .
this isn ' t real .
can you feel my hands . are they real ? can you feel my lips , my loins ? <continued_utterance> i ' m with you , <person> . <continued_utterance> i ' ll always be with you now . now and forever .
what do you mean you don ' t want to go to church ?
mrmph , rmph rmph rm rmph .
but we were . <person> and me running everything . <person> and <person> the hottest girls . <person> and .
me having the fattest thighs .
you still didn ' t tell him we ' re rooming-
no . <person> up .
i never been to a commune . i don ' t know . i saw pictures in a magazine , and it didn ' t look very clean to me .
why don ' t you come to a commune with me ?
i ' m on it .
i want to talk to khalil .
i don ' t think i can handle public .
yes , no . lots of people right now is .
pay attention . the <number> series had rubber skin . we spotted them easy . but these are new . they look human . <person> , bad breath , everything . <person> hard to spot . i had to wait ' til he moved on you before i could zero him .
hey , i ' m not stupid , y ' know . they can ' t build anything like that yet .
no other signs of torture here . why take somebody ' s eyelids off ?
so they can ' t blink . <continued_utterance> it ' s a metaphor - to make certain the victim sees . or to make certain that we see something . or maybe it ' s just a fuck-you .
it is nine p . m . pleasant dreams .
<person> . no . you ' re kidding . lights out ? at nine ? my day ' s just starting .
the thought had crossed my mind .
the only possible reason you ' re here is because you ' re not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all . so you ' ve come to dissuade me from my horrific plan . <person> luck .
you did not like the speech ?
the speech is excellent . `` oh , then i see <person> hath been with you ! '' excellent and a good length . but then he disappears for the length of a bible .
well , okay . i ' ll take you about nine-thirty in the morning . that ' s okay with you ?
great . <continued_utterance> before , everything had been so confusing . i never knew who was to blame . but now i know . he ' s just a thief , a sneaky thief who had robbed his daughter . <person> me of . whatever it was that my sister still had and i didn ' t . and then the accident robbed me of my body .
you blew it -- big time . she doesn ' t want you back .
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?
you did . thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here , in this time . <person> gives him an amazed look .
this is deep .
what ' s furry , furry rabbit ?
that ' s a game isn ' t it ? anyway . there ' s been some interesting developments .
yeah .
ya see that woman there ?
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel ?
no .
anyway , isn ' t green the color of islam , not blue ?
-- and , excuse me , but why do we immediately assume they ' re <person> ?
<person> . <person> <person> . i ' m your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural <person> . <person> .
sounds a lot of run . so they sent the big guns to check up on me . we recruiting children now ?
i don ' t think that ' s where he ' s headed .
he wouldn ' t .
i don ' t know , why did you ?
what ?
he ' s on the ph .
<person> , th ' <person> rossen , i ' m here in .
i keep thinking i should tell <person> .
no , no . this is a really bad time to even mention it - no , no , no . find another time . later .
<person> , i ' m just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity . <person> ' t feel bad . unless you feel strange about wearing it .
no . i mean , i remember mrs . <person> wearing some of this stuff , but . i don ' t feel funny about that . i really liked her .
<person> , i ' m alright .
<person> , good .
sure .
that ' s what it ' s there for , man . <person> brother . <continued_utterance> <person> , one more thing . <continued_utterance> your hard drive is filthy , all right . we got your computer back . i mean , it is , it is , dirty . i ' m talking like hoes , sluts , anal , double anal , penetration , inter racial facial , man . <person> pie . i don ' t even know what that is . <continued_utterance> do you think it was your intern ?
help yourself . you have to every thing else .
that sounds like hostility , doesn ' t it <person> ?
<person> .
it can ' t be tonight . i will take you tomorrow . we have an auction tonight at sotheby ' s -
you ' re the greatest <person> .
thanks . we should get ready for dinner .
<person> ?
it ' s my belief that <person> was doing exactly what she ' d been doing for years . besides , the school board ' s insurance on <person> is minimal . a few million at the very most . the really deep pockets are to be found in the town , or in the company that made the bus .
<person>s . no problem . how would you like ' m ?
yes .
<person> did this ?
no . <person> ' s the one on the ground .
<person> closet .
thanks .
you don ' t believe me ? you don ' t fucking believe me ?
of . course i do . i just thought . i could get you another <continued_utterance> test . in case the one you got . was wrong .
never mind . i ' ll just eat my lunch .
i ' m almost done making it . <person> --
what !
<person> ' t forget .
go on .
he was doing a job for a couple of brothers in smith street . i think it was a pawn shop .
yes . i ' ll tell you .
promise . ? then why not take your case file ? i won ' t be needing it anymore . he holds out the file , arm extended between the bars . she hesitates , then reaches to take it .
<person> ? i am sorry , duty ? <person> fucking duty . <person> is , you americans want everybody to live like you . we liberated <person> , major <person> , not you . our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture . dymshitz bursts out laughing . <person> , <person> advances on him , almost as if he ' s about to attack him physically . he stops , sways a little , then , after a moment , drops down in a chair near to dymshitz . they drink . intimate:
i ' m gon na get that fucking bandleader , <person> . no deal . no fucking deal .
let me show you . <continued_utterance> first take your glass and examine the wine against the light . you ' re looking at color and clarity .
what color is it supposed to be ?
<person> on it . so now you want to kill yourself in another accident . not with me , <person> .
but i ' m telling you . i ' ve got this --
you mean forget ?
it would erase all our knowledge of it . all of our power .
we sent it to the times . geoffrey smiles politely .
they have the joke page of things around new york .
no . did you ever steal anything ? you ever hit someone ?
well , i ' ve been in fights . let me think .
that ' s right , officer . what ' s he done now ?
could i speak with him , please ?
it is broad day ! the rooster tells us so !
it was the owl . believe me , love , it was the owl .
when ?
when something is really , really funny .
i love <person> men .
why ?
especially over a certain age .
it is easier to be killed by a terrorist after the age of <number> than it is to get married --
how the fuck can you be so sure ?
because he helped me recruit the network in iraq . okay ? <continued_utterance> we were part of the operation to destabilize <person> . printing up fake dinars , arming the kurds --
well , i meant -
<person> actually , what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again . so you might just as well have said , `` here goes something and here comes nothing . `` hah ?
<person> ? fuck you , you little dipshit .
<person> ? did you say dipshit ? ! grab this guy . <continued_utterance> now who ' s the dipshit , you jock douchebag ? <continued_utterance> put the gun down ! now ! ! <continued_utterance> <person> away . <continued_utterance> <person> . you were gon na kill that guy !
barging in on you ; what an idiot .
if you ' re going into hadditon - we ' re really low on chicken feed .
y tu mama what ?
y tu mama tambien . it ' s mexican .
so , the doctor , he has to make the - - come se dice ?
postmortem ?
it ' s <person> poitier-kittredge . it ' s a hyphenated name .
<person> ? you need help . go to the police . <person> yourself in . you ' ll be over it all the sooner . you can start .
mr . <person> . i think it is a shame <person> won ' t let us have him in the house to sit down . have you met him yet , <person> ?
no .
they ' d have his last known address . names of relatives . well it ' s a chance . isn ' t it ? how can you be so obtuse ?
what ? what did you call me ?
. wait till she lifts off , take him outside and shoot him .
. why can ' t the girl go home ?
the usual . <person> crash . survivors unknown . <person> stuff really .
anything else ?
yes .
i tested positive .
i ' m afraid it is dr . <person> . because it ' s sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor . <continued_utterance> off the record , i don ' t mind telling you , this thing scares the shit out of me .
it doesn ' t make any sense .
did he have a case with him ?
yes .
were you here last night ?
nope . <person> ' t done nights since i got promoted .
but .

you bet , terrance ! <continued_utterance> ha ha ha ! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart ! ha ha ha ! !
that ' s where he ' s going ?
also , owner of record , in essex .
i want that person to go to jail . for the rest of his life . i want him to die there . i don ' t want his money . <continued_utterance> mitchell nods sympathetically .
it ' s unlikely that anyone will go to prison , mrs . <person> . but he or his company will pay in other ways . and we must make them pay . not for the money or to compensate you for the loss of your son . that can ' t be done . but to protect other innocent children . you see , i ' m not just here to speak for your anger , but for the future as well . what we ' re talking about is an ongoing relationship to time .
indefinitely .
how long is that ?
why do you make that face when you talk to me ? and that voice you use . you think i ' m deaf or something ?
i ' m sorry , okay ? let ' s not fi .
<person> a second , aren ' t you like a famous bachelor ?
i wouldn ' t say i ' m famous .
what . does it turn to ?
it turns to steaming piss . <continued_utterance> i ' m . so sorry .
<person> . dr . <person> .
<person> .
he ' s not any kind of program , <person> . he ' s a <person> .
a <person> ?
i didn ' t forget . i was up all night thinking about it and i concluded you ' re too special to look like everyone else . <person> . that ' s your color . few can carry it off . now please . help me find your brother .
you lost <person> ? !
thank you . <continued_utterance> for what you did . thank you .
you want a coke ?
well , he fired the nurse after an hour , now says he doesn ' t need one .
how are you holding up ?
you ' re lying . i ' m not human .
<person> , i am not going back . i ' m staying here with you .
you ' re lying . i don ' t believe it .
what do your senses tell you ?
you are using me , too ! everybody uses the palestinians ! we are the whores of the middle east ! you make reports about our little talks -- ? what about fucking me ?
i had to get special permission for that .
well , i ' ll do my best . we ' ll talk after ?
great . and -- ooh -- my back --
<person> , he ate the gun . <person> ' t you know ?
i ' ve been out of town .
you could move in with us in town .
never , thank you .
nice .
so what do you think ?
is that possible ?
which part ?
until the accident ? no . yes , there was . <continued_utterance> it was when <person> got on . he was crying and didn ' t want to leave his mother . <person> was sitting beside me . i asked him to move , so i could quiet <person> down . when the bus started up , a car came around <continued_utterance> the corner and almost hit <person> ' s mother . she was okay , but it really scared <person> , because he watched it out the window .
and was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did ?
get outa here , you bum !
hey , what are you talking about ? !
you know i ' ve never seen a woman that age naked before .
you ' re kidding ?
i thought you were scared of blood ?
you better take a shower .
of course , we ' re always looking for a betty hutton . do you see it as a betty hutton ?
frankly , no .
he ' s no father to you . <continued_utterance> <person> with that one . he won ' t tell me anything , but i know there ' s something strange going on over at the lanes . if you ask me , i ' d say the old fart wants to die .
where can i find him ?
<person> . out of the way -- flan takes ouisa ' s-arm .
we have to do soaething !
no you don ' t . and i ' m not gon na screw with my kids heads right now --
you know i don ' t need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot . your ex-wife ' s doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just don ' t know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long ! <person> what did you see in her ? i don ' t get it -- i just don ' t get it .
i am .
then kiss me again for i am not mistook . <continued_utterance> i do not know how to undress a man .
you ' re welcome to wait outside .
general . you ' ve lost men , i ' ve lost men . but what you ' re doing . it doesn ' t work in belfast . it doesn ' t work in gaza . and it won ' t work here . -- what if . they don ' t want their leader back at all ? you said yourself , we don ' t even have him . maybe what they really want -- is that we herd our children into stadiums . put soldiers into our streets . radicalize people who want to think of themselves as americans . bend the law , shred the constitution . because if we torture him -- and let ' s call it what it is . you . and i . then the country men like us have sworn to defend . and bled to defend . and died to defend . is gone . and they ' ve won .
you could argue he ' d done it to curry favor with the guards . or maybe make a few friends among us cons . me , i think he did it just to feel normal again . if only for a short while . <continued_utterance> king me .
<person> . now there ' s a game of kings . civilized . strategic .
what was the first thing ?
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior . sometimes violent behavior . theo <person> had two of his fingers bit off by his cow .
no ! i can ' t even fucking drive . it ' s a nightmare .
<person> , wait a minute , wait a minute . you can ' t drive ?
<person> , if you ever get out of here , do me a favor . there ' s this big hayfield up near <person> . you know where <person> is ?
lots of hayfields there .
oh , <person> , her lips ! the early morning rose would wither on the branch , if it could feel envy !
and her voice ? like lark song ?
i don ' t know . special occasion . with the right person . it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary .
the day you open a ' <number> <person> , that ' s the special occasion .
solitary ! a month !
what ' s the matter with you ? it ' s my chance to get out , don ' t you see that ? it ' s my life ! <person> ' t you understand it ' s my life ?
hey , come on .
i trod in the sponge mix .

good stuff .
`` be calm my life , my all . only by calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together . oh continue to love me , never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved . ever thine -- ever mine -- ever ours . <person> . the beautiful sentiment hangs in the air . she closes the book and looks up at him . <continued_utterance> have you ever written me a love letter ?

i ' ve got to go to the bottle bank .

oh yes , it ' s essential . <person> , a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow . now , we can do it in half the time . those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago , when sido-dyas first placed the order , and they ' re already mature .
and these ?
up there . i . eh . can ' t explain . but that ' s the only place you could be from .
gas .

it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil .
<person> .
say it . come on . one time .
so if i gave you my life , what would you do with it ? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now ? or could you change ? could you try to remember a mother ' s touch you never felt ? a father ' s words you never heard ? could you do that ?
i don ' t know .
if you don ' t mind , mam , i ' d rather work for you .
well , we ' re all working tonight .

some journey .
yes , yes , captain -- thank you for coming .
nothing for me . i understand there ' s something urgent you need to discuss with me .
<person> , but stupid , my old jedi friend . you ' re impossibly outnumbered .

he thinks it ' s very cold to be sleeping outside .
il signor <person> ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali ?
bi-coastal parenting . <person> every day . <person> gets the kids every other summer , every other holiday , it ' s not ideal , but people make it work , and .
we can ' t live like that .
what purpose does this serve ?
it seems to be a redundant memory port . maybe it ' s for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload ?
every moment in life is a learning experience or what good is it ? right ? right ?
well , yes .
dr . <person> ! come in , come in , sit down . <continued_utterance> no , no , take this one , it ' s more comfortable <continued_utterance> if it ' s too hot , open your tie .

no monsters .
thank you .
anywhere ! oh ! !
<person> ! <person> !
in a dictatorship , art belongs to the party . if you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .
this is what i ' m saying . he must have had party contacts .
hey , she doesn ' t want to go with you . come on . <continued_utterance> oh god , man . don ' t shoot me . my mistake . i ' m sorry .
he doesn ' t understand . just walk away .
how come we never got together ?
can ' t we just be friends , <person> ?
it ' s a hunting knife , right here on my hip . <continued_utterance> i was on my way to the woods . my gear ' s in the trunk . would you like me to hand it to you ? i don ' t know what the procedure is for something like this .
take the weapon off your hip , place it on the ground , and kick it toward me .
i ' m too tired for this . <person> ' s just go .
<person> , this is what we came for . we met a beautiful baby and she likes you .
if i were . i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior . i would `` miss you . ``
now , you make a toast .
<person> .
<person> --
trash rats !
sound off !
<person> to know where there ' s one for sale .
well ain ' t you amazing .
and the questionnaire . ?
a census taker once tried to test me . i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti . fly back to school , little starling .
i don ' t think that ' s a good idea , <person> .
i just got to talk to you for one second .
<person>rrrr .
<person> .
you told me that your boy was washed up with <person> , didn ' t you ?
yeah , and it ' s the truth , to the best of my knowledge . and , frankly , i ' m glad . for <person> ' s sake , i ' m glad , not yours . i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart . <person> shouldn ' t get mixed up with no bimbo at his age .
<person> ' s dad -- he ' s been talking about bringing me into his property business . showing me the ropes . and that ' s something , considering how long it took him to get over i ' m not armenian . so i ' m thinking about it . but i don ' t know , might get a little incestuous . but <person> does pretty well . a lot of high-end commercial stuff .
so you ' re going to stop acting ?
but <person> .
<person> ' s over at the spread eagle every other night . <person> with whatever she can get her hands on . she ' ll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t even think of the bilodeaus or the atwaters . they ' re all inbred .
<person> , i ' d like to meet him .
i ' ll have him wave up to you .
<person> for him .
<person> , right ? pure bullshit . . except , it worked . it ' s how he drew this : <continued_utterance> he ' d never been in that house before . he just saw what was in there - the bureau taught him how . same one that deleted him . same one that ' s trying to catch him now . does anything about all this strike you as odd ?
you got him a student visa .
i sign these applications as a matter of course , hundreds of them . everyone wants to come to the land of opportunity and baywatch .
<person> .
you have to put things in perspective .
yes . your attitude have been very positive lately . <person> looks up at him . her voice is hopeful .
it has helped me a lot to have a goal , something to look forward to .
i ' ll be treated with care if you take me to the police . if they don ' t know you ' re special , they kill you .
i don ' t think they kill you .
but you only wore mascara when you and <person> went on romantic dates .
well <person> and i are just friends now , and that ' s no reason not to wear mascara .
passing through ! you ' re so white . did you ever see a guy so white , <person> ? gray , actually .
it ' s just an undercoat .
why don ' t you come in ?
uh-uh . you ' re on your own .
no , no baby . take it to the bank . the <person> , <person> . all the oil - all the money in the world . what can ' t they have ? booze and <person> .
you the candy man ? is that it ? <continued_utterance> ah . <person> .
and i didn ' t bargain for you turning into a pompous politico . <person> ' up to hodges . that ' s it , <person> , isn ' t it ? . you ' ve become a republican ! ! !
and you ' ve become a drunk .
yes ?
my name ' s <person> .
thing is , see . . i don ' t read all that good .
well . you ' ve come to the right place then . <continued_utterance> . and the lamplight o ' er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor . and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor , shall be lifted nevermore ! ``
that ' s right , buddy , i ' m a mess . and i ' m no good at it . those are very nice pajamas , by the way . did they used to be mine ?
yes but you gave them to me , you said you never wore them .
i need your help , luke . she needs your help . i ' m getting too old for this sort of thing .
i can ' t get involved ! i ' ve got work to do ! it ' s not that i like the empire . i hate it ! but there ' s nothing i can do about it right now . it ' s such a long way from here .
you sure you didn ' t call one of your close buddies and say , god in heaven , did you see what that guy von der <person> wrote about me ? the greatest conductor on earth . i want him out the way . he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music . send him to stalingrad . <person> ' t that what you did ? you don ' t like criticism , do you , <person> ? you surely didn ' t like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you . are you saying the name von der <person> was never mentioned in your talks with <person> ?
well . once he said he ' d read what this man wrote about me .
i am big . it ' s the pictures that got small .
i knew there was something wrong with them .
<person> . i ' d better go now .
you ' ll be sorry , <person> . peter leaves .
<person> , daughter of big <person> , owner and operator of this here fine water park . <continued_utterance> see , princess tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park . her boyfriend is <person> , a guy we all call <person> , one of the lifeguards . pretty decent guy from what i can tell . but she ' s a piece of work . your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won ' t cause you any trouble .
<person> , huh . big guy ?
<person> . wow . <continued_utterance> how are you ?
great ! i ' m <person>-mead now .
<person> ' t it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship ?

what happens on page <number> ? have you ever read page <number> ?
i just checked `` downtown '' . <person> everywhere tonight .
incidentally , what happened to that doll ? - you gave me the item last night . still alive ?
me ? well , i was wrapped in seaweed . it itched for a while , but i survived . <person> , do you find it . curious that we ' re seeing all this life down here . nothing , and then these enormous flocks of squid . then jellyfish ?
normally , i ' d say no . everything ' s quiet now -- no ships , no divers , no electricity . makes sense . but what ' s curious is -- these aren ' t normal jellyfish .
maybe you should see a shrink .
i want my money .
how does he do it ?
he can ' t . they initiate .
well , then , we ' ve got a little problem .
i was there .

that ' s true of lots of things .
<person> instance ?
<person> ?
toi . they ' ve been ' going out ' for two weeks . <continued_utterance> as you may know , ' going out ' in the six grade doesn ' t mean shit . they don ' t actually <continued_utterance> anyway . he walks up to her on lunch yard today . and tells her . publicly . that they ' re ' breaking up . ' <person> ' s mouth drops .

<person> , how ' s your video rep . <continued_utterance> what happened with <person> ? has nothing i said gotten through to you ?

the doctor suggested it .
what doctor ?
that ' s really something .
oh , you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab . especially when the moon ' s out .
what about plan c ?
fuck plan c !
yes , but , <person> , <person> ' s been , well , he ' s just been having a few , uh , `` thoughts , '' about .
how many times in your life do you get a speech like that ?
you can ' t hold us to account for every promise made by that man . everyone knows he wasn ' t responsible for his actions half the time . and if you think i ' d have you as a foreman --
<person> , lady -- i ' d rather walk for somebody else , than ride for you .
they were pregnant .
what ? ! knocked-up bettys ? ! <person> ' t-a been <person> , his schlong is molded to his body . hey , at the police line-up , they should just see whose knees can bend the wrong way .
with all respect for your expertise , sir . we ' re on track here .
<person> is what i said to the president -- the army is not some big green police department . <person> with the man on the ground .
i love chocolate . i realized just yesterday how much i love it . i thought maybe , if they let you bring personal effects , you might have snuck some through , because . well , i ' ve been thinking about it .
what happened here ?
people finding out . seeing . that the lapd just flat out executed <person> . <person> . maybe they ought to see .
maybe . but tonight is probably not the best night . come on , we ' re rollin ' .
the mayor ' s outside .

want me to come over ?
i like to bleed , sir .
it doesn ' t . hurt ?
<person> , sherri , this is frustrating for me , okay . when we first started going out i thought we agreed that we weren ' t the sort of people who got married .
that ' s like saying we ' re not the sort of people who are going to grow old . we ' re not going to fall into that `` growing old '' trap . face it , you ' ve got a problem with commitment , <person> . take a look at your other girlfriends . every time you get close to a commitment there ' s something wrong with them .
i ' d call them excuses . and the first excuse on both our lists was our `` sense of duty . `` we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else . and you know what ? it ' s not .
i have a ship to launch .
get him out of here as soon as you decently can -- will you . this is a nice item for the gossips . first thing you know , they ' ll be talking about orgies . i ' d better get back .

<person> .

<person> -- gim me the gun .
oh , sure . here . anything else , <person> can get you ? some more chicken , perhaps . <person> <person> check the fridge .
where should i put this ? it ' s an empty water glass . what are the choices ?
i ' m gettin ' outta your hair .
well , you got beef --
yes -- an ' i got a bill of sale fer it , too .

if he ' s really the one , you can find out the rest of his plan .
you , um , you , um , you going out with your fiance ?
no , i just broke up with him . i ' ll see you tomorrow .
why don ' t you just split ? you don ' t love him , anybody can see that . and to him you ' re just some kinda possession , like a ferrari , something to show the other guys .
he has his uses too .
if i whistle . those boys ' ll see you , and come runnin ' . <continued_utterance> naw , i ' ve seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes .
better take three . fingers nimbly shred the seal , open the pack . <continued_utterance> maybe they ' ll keep us waiting .
it ' s over , norman . go on , get outta here . <continued_utterance> what is that ? what are you doing ?
what ?
i don ' t know honey . soon we hope . you want it to end quickly , huh ?
oh , i don ' t care , i was just asking cuz all my favorite tv shows have been replaced by news and it ' s pissing me off .
you can ' t go around killing people just because you think they ' re useless .
oh , what ' s a life or two ? some people are bitter off dead , <person> . take your -- wife and my father , for instance . it reminds me of a wonderful idea had once . i used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out . now , let ' s say you want to get rid of your wife .
what ? what are you starting ?
i have to go mom . the card ' s almost out of minutes .
<person> ' t be so hard on yourself .
i just got kicked off my first movie .
<person> . i guess i do , sir .
<person> , we ' ve lost two recruits over this incident already . is there any possibility of salvaging this man ? zim i believe so , sir . <continued_utterance> alright . we ' ll try administrative punishment . <person> then you are confined to your quarters , <person> .
that taxi driver . the one that ' s been sitting here .
how long has he been there ?
state to federal jurisdiction . we can do it - eventually - but we ' ll never get all the clearances in time . can you convince him a deal ' s already in place ?
you ' ll back me up with some paperwork ? then i ' ll try . but wouldn ' t this have more weight coming from the senator herself ?
oh yeah ? where is she ?
<person> . she left two days ago , for her birthday . but she ' ll be back next week .
<person> ' t worry . i ' m not mad . i was looking for decoration to put on the glass so people would stop walking into it and instead of taking what they had in stock , which was awful , i special ordered . i ' ll design something myself which i should have done in the fi . our heroine , seeing the blood flow from her aunt ' s nose , gestures that <person> needs help not conversation . <continued_utterance> . and what difference does that make when your nose is bleeding .
now you got it , <person> .
i ' m sorry .
<person> ' t sweat it , baby . this one ' s a lay- up .
here . i wish i coulda met my real dad .
you will .
i was there , <person> .
who ' s lying ? you or him ?
gas .
<person> .
yes , <person> ?
this prom is a real drag .
<person> . pull a number <number> steel blue gel on the back light . yeah i ' m on my way but .
now <person> , let <person> play with his batcave .
not really . <person> , <person> , i love you . <person> ' s leave that out of it . i don ' t want to be someone you ' re settling for . i don ' t want to be someone anyone settles for . i have a life insurance policy , i ' m fully invested in growth stocks , i have a paid subscription to <person> , i have no sexual diseases , i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn ' t soft , i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth , i dress nicely , i am a member of the private sector , an independent voter , i don ' t watch monday night football , the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat , strawberries , penicillin , pollen , nuts and wool . there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring . if you don ' t -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it , isn ' t it ?
oh , <person> . i don ' t deserve you .
what i can ' t get out of my mind is the image of <person> -- my nephew . i just can ' t believe he ' s gone .

all right , check that side of the street . it ' s secure . <person> on to the next door .
i would much rather have gone with <person> than stay here with you . i don ' t know what all the trouble is about , but i ' m sure it must be your fault . <continued_utterance> you watch your language !

then you leave me no choice . i call for an embargo on all canadian imports ! ! !
<person> --
no , i should stay calm . like you say . <person> , norman ? stay calm . <continued_utterance> fletcher and <person> are dead , norman . and the only one we can trust to run this place is a fucking liar .

well , i don ' t really take the subway ever , so .
you bet .
and totally irrelevant .
i ' ve never heard you express any desire to leave before now . why now ?
well , i think we ' re reaching the point of diminishing returns here , right ? certainly it ' s learning more about us than we ' ll ever learn about it .
the what ?
<person> . <person> machines . build in automated factories . most of us were rounded up , put in camps . for orderly disposal . he pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows <continued_utterance> burned in by laser scan . some of us were kept alive . to work . loading bodies . the disposal units ran night and day . we were that close to going out forever . the helicopter moves overhead . its searchlight illum- inates the car interior , moves on . before the rotor sound fads , reese starts the car .

she was the greatest . you wouldn ' t know . you are too young . in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters . men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails . there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings . later , he strangled himself with it .
i sure turned into an interesting driveway .
it ' s a good script , isn ' t it ?
it ' s got a lot of good things . of course , it would be an expensive picture .
sex . of course .

no ! that was the last thing i thought of . my dream was to help in the `` <person> . `` i never thought of running for elected office . but the more history i studied , the more i realised how much good politicians could do . so when i was eight , i joined the `` apprentice legislators '' , then later on became a senatorial advisor , with such a passion that , before i knew it , i was elected <person> . <person> because i scored so high on my education certificate , but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible . i wasn ' t the youngest <person> ever elected , but now that i think back on it , i ' m not sure i was old enough . i ' m not sure i was ready .
the people you served thought you did a good job . i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office .
i want no more trouble , mr . <person> . as i explained to you , the theatre business
<person> , you pound of tripe , in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage , so don ' t tell me about business

why would you want to know ? listen up , pal . they don ' t go through the door . we don ' t ask why . that ' s not a cost , it ' s a benefit . because we got to <person> . you wan na lose sleep over it , get over it , or get out . you wanted to go through the looking glass . how was it ? was it more fun than <person> . ?

this is on you . you did this . you set a fucking house on fire ! you .
well , anyone who gets you is lucky .
how come we never got together ?
trials aren ' t only about truth , mr . <person> . even though they should be . they ' re about what people <continued_utterance> we were afraid . <person> seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake .
well , it seems to me . nels objection . mr . <person> can give his view in his summation . <continued_utterance> <person> ' t it seem to <continued_utterance> i suppose that you mean this
i must get to my ship , mr . <person> .
we can ' t let you do that .
so ? what ' s the problem ?
it ' s nonsense . there ' s enough difference between our own species to prove that .
the empire is still out there . i don ' t think it ' s wise to .
no time to discuss this in committee .
you ' d be , like , hangin ' out with us every night after school , right ?
<person> - well , after football practice .

you never told me .
but she was different . there was a light in her eyes . and she had this voice . it was scary , all that pain coming out of that little body . like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice . i helped her . and i promised her that i ' d always be there . to protect her . <person> ? it ' s not about what ' s in her head . it ' s what ' s in mine . i can ' t let go of the promise . it ' s .

<person> , i know human nature . <person> lied to me - she ' ll see that boy again .
you ' re right , j . j . - she won ' t give him up , but it doesn ' t matter . because the real `` money ball '' is the boy , not <person> . and if --
mr . <person> ! what are you doing here ?
that ' s for them to know , and for you to find out .
have you been sneaking into the icom system ?
whew . you never were much for small talk . she still leave her clothes all over the floor ?
you ' re saying i could have saved those people ? !
no . not in our world . the time currents are too strong . but minor alterations , here and there , a phone call , say , those might slip through . we didn ' t know for sure . but you proved it . <person> is thunderstruck . unable to grasp it . <continued_utterance> i ' ve been thinking about the things you said on that call . as the day passed , the more i understood them . and now , i guess we ' ve caught up to each other .
what ' s a matter , <person> ?
the phone just went dead . i was on the phone and it went dead .
a couple days ; that ' s all i ' m askin ' . i can stay clear that long .
<person> , they ' ll probably miss you and hit me .
would it helped if i got out and pushed ?
it might .
oh , <person> . you know , i left my wallet over in my locker . i ' ll see you before we leave and get it to you then .
<person> , sure .
it ' s been quite a ride . <person> , i thought maybe i ' d hear from you when it opened . where ' ve you been ?
after i saw you in the theater that afternoon , i had another `` episode .
no , you did , <person> , not me . me , i don ' t give a shit about her . plenty of pussy in bombay for <person> . oh , yes , sir ! you should come down the cages on saturday night instead of searching for your lost love .
i ' m going to <person> .
<person> . <person> . <person> . you seek <person> .
you know him ?
you ' d be surprised .
i ' d like to hear . name me something bad you ' ve done in your life .
but my work !
your work is a disaster ! look at yourself !
that fat chick from the party ?
<person> , i ' ll call you later .
yes , i heard . the theatres are open . but where is my playwright ? <continued_utterance> chalk it up , <person> . i ' m hungry , too .
the special today is a pig ' s foot marinated in juniper-berry vinegar , served with a buckwheat pancake which has been
what was it ?
droid of some kind . i didn ' t hit it that hard . it must have had a self-destruct .
bullshit politics .
it ' s always politics . like this thing we ' re in here , he ' s paying you to tune me up , right ? but i could pay you more not to . see what i mean ? i could write you a check right now --
i think so .
well , he ' d better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there ' ll be hell to pay !
who bombed the train , captain ?
i have no idea .
<person> to me about costs , here .
<person> , before we get into numbers , i want you to try a taste . i got a deck with me .
then how come you won ' t hold hands with me at school ?
i don ' t want everyone to see .
what if he wants to get out ?
he ' s earned an early retirement . but enough about losers ; <person> fazeli is history . lets talk about your future . i wan na show you something .
he is an officer of the republic .
we don ' t recognise the republic here , senator . but if <person> were to join our alliance , i could easily hear your plea for clemency .
we have to get off this beam !
i can ' t . there ' s no junction due for at least <number> or <number> nanoseconds !
is that true ?
i did . so i figure everyone does .
i didn ' t mention her once today .
well , until now . tend the pin .
best place to be when it comes .
uh-uh .
you ' ve got <person> ' s rings .
i can explain .
i ' m a little tired and it ' s just a pick-me-up .
but you only wore mascara when you and <person> went on romantic dates .
. little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party . city council ? what ' s the trouble ?
<person> .
<person> . <person> , this is dr . silber- man . i ' d like you to tell him everything <person> said to you . do you feel up to it ?
i guess so . you ' re a doctor ?

what ' s this ? <person> ' s keeping a diary . <person> takes an involuntary step forward .
she ' s full of surprises . <continued_utterance> oh no .
pin him down , mother ! who gave the orders ! ?
the orders come from admiral james t . <person> .
the police shouldn ' t have started shooting . but you can hardly blame them . you surprised them . they didn ' t know you were up there . when they saw you , they thought you were here to hurt us .
i understand .
so .
you still going away ?
do you want a fruit plate ?
i don ' t know . do i ?
we left it in a box over there . somewhere . <continued_utterance> i t ' s empty .
<person> .
<person> may still be obsessed with getting back . and if he is , he ' ll do anything to find that doorway again .
but why destroy a star . ? thank you , <person> .
uh huh , i wan na hear this part .
<person> , take some executive . bored with his life , bored with his wife . he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar . then he goes around for months , torn up worrying that he ' s got aids , that he ' ll infect his wife . and maybe he really does catch something --
<person> . shell oil . <person> , i don ' t have intel experience . why do you have me doing this ?
you ' ve already been told what you need to know . discipline your memory . limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you . everything else is irrelevant .
so , you ' re the pinman around here ?
. and one , and two , and yes , i am . but no one gets them working like <person> used to . and two , and one . - they call him the ' quasimodo of the lanes . ' he ' s the best pinman there is . and one and two . people used to say he got the machines working so well ' cause he lubricated them with blood . and two , and one . but people just love saying things about <person> .
i will say that we can be friends .
we can . <continued_utterance> this is yours .
what ' s not right ?
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that . just like you questioned him .
right . that explains it .
are you going to make me beg ? <continued_utterance> what is that ?
<person> activated !

so i hear .
yes . <person> toward the end .
why did she do it ?
what do you call it ?
i dunno .
yes , i did .
thank you , <person> . i feel so much better just having blown this off .
she ' s been implicated in a crime . i need the photo to eliminate her as a suspect .
and if she ' s not innocent . if she ' s , you know , `` quirky ? ''
<person> . i know it was irresponsible to stay at the drug bust until it was over , but . what happened ?
i ' m gon na tell you , but when i do , just say nothing . <person> ' t judge me . just be my friend . <person> ?
so she feels . what he feels . while he ' s in her . the thrill while he ' s killing her . is sent to her , heightening her fear . which in turn heightens the turn on for him . i ' ve seen a lot , <person> .
so ' ve i . too much .
<person> so . -- seems <person> found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night .

a man was killed tonight . attacked from behind . asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles . and there ' s a witness . or a suspect . we ' re not sure yet . we should go .
first principles , <person> . simplicity . <person> . of each particular thing , ask : what is it , in itself , what is its nature . ? what does he do , this man you seek ?
he kills w-
you ' re the expert . if you have any suggestions on how to proceed .

is your mind racing ?
we don ' t have thirty-six hours . <continued_utterance> electric shock ?
the neurotransmitters just shut down .
<person> , i owe her a lot .

he came in last week on a very dull rainy night . i know who he was , but i didn ' t let on . he didn ' t take his eyes off me all night . listening . ? <person> has mistaken <person> ' s shrewdly calculating expression for inattention .
<person> . he was staring .
first i ' m going to rip the buttons off your blouse , one by one . then run my tongue along your neck , down to your bare , gleaming breasts .
<person> ! it ' s <person> .
if it ' s okay with you ?
it ' s okay with me .
<person> .

one for me .
<person> ' t you know that <person> is dead ?
so you ' re part of the mining guild then ?
no , not actually . our operation is small enough not to be noticed . which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves .
what do you think you ' re doing ?
we ' re getting out of here .
why were you scared ? <continued_utterance> this is before the accident , <person> .
yes , i understand .
hope you ' re ready for more . we ' re going back to p to capture that <person> .
the roughnecks are always ready , sir .
i used the last one to jump off the cliff .
<person> ' s find a place out of the rain . i ' m sure we ' ll get a ride in the morning .
i don ' t think dr . <person> sent me a telegram . i was simply told . in a letter , i believe . i don ' t remember exactly .
<person> and goering were sure heaping honours on you . one makes you a privy councillor , the other makes you vice-president of the chamber of music , and you weren ' t even a member of the party , how do you explain that ?

<person> ' s not a real transsexual , but he thinks he is . he tries to be . he ' s tried to be a lot of things , i expect .
you ' re not someone who lies very easily . so it ' s obvious when you do . at least to me .
are you always sucha good judge of character ?
well , i don ' t go to the plaza every night .
i didn ' t mean you . but just ordinary people . a guy i know - dough-boy - met his wife that way . they got to talking . she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop , taking her home with the flag up .
no , i ' m okay .
hey , why don ' t you invite maya to the wedding ?

you tell her , <person> . come on , do her that favor . tell her there isn ' t going to be any picture -- there aren ' t any fan letters , except the ones you write yourself .
that isn ' t true ! <person> ?
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital ' s batteries .
it wasn ' t a trick . i used to be an electrical engineer .
it might help my analysis if i knew what <person> was .
<person> , ask dr . mccoy to join us in my quarters . mr . <person> , take the con .
i didn ' t give birth to you ! i didn ' t bring you into this world .

what am i supposed to do ? ! i saw one of my oldest friends get killed ! and i saw who did it ! i can ' t just -- `` let it go away '' ! !
because the best thing about people . is they can forgive each other . i heard that this morning .
that teacher . is gon na forgive me ?
absolutely , <person> . <person> , i had everything under control until you led us down here . you know , it ' s not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us .
it could be worse .
of course . <continued_utterance> this is great stuff . i could make a career out of this guy . you see how clever this part is . how it doesn ' t require a shred of proof . <person> paranoid delusions are intricate . but this is brilliant . <continued_utterance> why were the other two women killed ?
<person> official records were lost in the war . the computer knew almost nothing about <person> ' s mother . her name . where she lived , just the city . no scanner pictures . the terminator was just being systematic . <continued_utterance> you ' ve heard enough . decide .

<person> has my keeping but you have my heart .
where was she ? when you saw her , where was she exactly ?
on the cushion right next to you .
why didn ' t you say something ?
i guess i didn ' t want to admit it . and when you ' re in denial -- you don ' t dial .
god be praised ! <person> ?
as soon as i have found my muse
so it was `` love '' .
yeah . it was .
his whole life would be changed . if he could come upon . a fishing license .
well , there ' s only one a those issued per family . so how exactly would he do that ? this is not . going well . a dangerous silence . <continued_utterance> even doughnuts , y ' know . can push their luck .
this one has a weapon .
no , no . a . <number> , it probably got it in the woman ' s house . they were last seen in downtown <person> .
ballistic penetration shocks it , but only for a few seconds . <person> thinks about that . then:

my dream response from you , yes .
i ' m not quite there . actually , i just had this flash that the reason women in the old days used to faint was to avoid doing acts of violence against men . and i was all worried about figuring out the timing just to talk to you about renting a place for the summer .
this is mr . <person> , chief of police . <continued_utterance> <person> you talk a little ? <person> you tell the chief you have my lighter ? <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .

i ' m pretty busy , as you can see .
residence or business ?
a bus .
<person> . what about quiet time ?
right . there ' s no real curfew , but you must be quiet after ten .

you ' re wasting your time , kiddo . <person> ' s go .
i ' m sorry . i am confused . i am waiting for a mr . and mrs . <person> .
<person> , you ' ll be waiting for a long time .
give me the tape . <person> now .
what tape ? i ' m just trying to get my car back but the place is closed --
new yorkers are so damn attractive - - even the mayor is hot .
i believe that was his last campaign slogan .
i ' m tired to death . i couldn ' t make it . i just couldn ' t make it , <person> .
where were you all day ? you look terrible .
<person> ground ?

<person> ' s .
<person> who ?
you looking for <person> ?
' do you know where i can find him ?

the thing with <person> - it ' s like the sun shines on you and it ' s glorious , then he forgets you and it ' s very very cold .
hm-hmm .
where i would sit on his feet and he ' d fly me through the air . i hit my head on the ceiling and i blacked out . <continued_utterance> i was knocked out for <number> - <number> minutes .
i can ' t stay here ! i ' ll crack up ! <person> , what am i gon na do ?

oh yes you do . and you ' re going to tell me all about it .
i don ' t know nothing , i tell you --
i think you need to fire him . <continued_utterance> oh , fuck you . i ' m forty-five years old . i don ' t want to do this shit anymore .
i ' m not firing him , <person> . he ' s the best thing in the show . next to you .
here .
dollars . but how many ?
sure he ' ll make it . can ' t kill off a salty old hairpin like <person> that easy .
you ' re right . <person> must be gitten ' mighty tired of dustin ' off that doormat for him . by the way , how did you say it happened ?
<person> . d .
computer-ji d lock kiya-jaye . <continued_utterance> with one hundred and ninety- seven first class centuries , the answer is . d . <person> !

<person> , my life is at risk , and this is my home . i know it very well . that is why we ' re here . i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance .
yep . quite a day .
quite a week .
no . rescue me . it ' s very forced festive .
oh yes , that ' s just what every new year ' s eve party needs : a visit from the lost <person> sister .
how you , <person> . ?

the son ' a , the borg , the romulans , the evil <person> and that pesky nexus . you seem to get all the easy assignments !
just lucky , admiral .
hi <person> !
how ya doin ' see . how come everyone knows me by sight now ?
<person> . what else do you see , feel , taste .
a margarita . a cuban cigar .
yeah .
it just seems . kind of weird .
maybe so . but i think we need to ask <person> about it .
no . i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat . he might be listening now .
you are now prisoners of the blue team .
oh no ! name , rank , and mind your own business is all you get from me !
no .
is that your final answer ?
. and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles , further and further down . then i ' ll pull off your panties with my teeth .
who is this ?
<person> hysteria .
maybe you ' re upset that <person> moved in .
<person> never lied .
of course not . but it was emotional . a friend ' s plea set against his mother ' s attitude . <continued_utterance> those ' dirty looks ' . defendant ever aim one of those at you ?
and what have i done to her , besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ? sidney , you were right -- the boy ' s a dilly .
why ? because i don ' t like the way you toy with human lives ? - your contempt and malice ? because i won ' t be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it ' s crippled <person> . ? you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory . but to me , and thousands of others like me , you and your slimy scandal , your phony patriotics - to me , mr . <person> , you are a national disgrace !
i just got out of a six-year relationship . <person> ? that should help to explain why i ' m acting so weird . it ' s not you . it ' s me . i just wanted to say that . <person> . this is <person> . he dials again . there ' s no turning back .
hi . this is <person> . leave a message .
i had a teacher like that once .
maybe that ' s why it ' s good . it ' s true , it ' s moving . now why don ' t you use that character .
there ' s no correlation at all between where they ' re kidnapped and where they ' re found . ? what if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites ? do they converge at all ?
good idea , but he thought of it , too . we ' ve run simulations , using different vectors and the best dates we can assign . you put it all in the computer , and smoke comes out . no , this one is different . this one has seen us coming .
and a packing company , a chain of savings and loans and half the politicians in chicago and new york . there ain ' t a fix in the world gon na cool him out if he blows on ya .
i ' ll take him anyway .
i ' m just trying to help .
we don ' t need any of your help .
you have a lot of talent , <person> .
so you still a virgin ? <continued_utterance> st . elmo ' s fire - rev . <number> / <number> / <number> <number> .
a theatre poet ?
an insolent penny-a-page rogue , <person> , he said , christopher <person> -- has he been to the house ?
be quiet .
he has made the choice , <person> . with your own eyes you saw it yesterday .
grandma and <person> sent you pictures of a neighbor girl . they didn ' t want you to break out and come kidnap me .
<person> g-d . i was starting to think i ' d killed the wrong man .
hey .
it was only a question of time before you got some attention . nobody brings a fella the size of you unless they are trying to say something without talking .
no .
a virgin brain ! well we ' re going to start you off right . so what do you know about this ? save us some time .
you ' re a ringer . she brought you in to replace me . out with the old .
<person> on .
generally , you , as mentor , draw on some personal religious philosophy to first intimidate , and then later inspire me .
i ' m <person> .
you already have a partner mr . <person> . <person> walks over as the sleazeballs ' car pulls out of the driveway .
i think <person> is retiring soon . in fact , i think he ' s retiring tonight . <person> pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of <person> . <continued_utterance> here , <person> . why don ' t you two go and do something fun tonight , on me . <person> is lured to the scent of the plastic like a junkie to a fix . <continued_utterance> one thing , stay away from the lanes . if <person> sees you two together , he ' ll swallow his tongue . she reaches for the card and <person> snatches it away from her with a chortle . <continued_utterance> what did i say ?
how about my cousin <person> ?
i don ' t need brain surgery , i just had a weird thing happen , that ' s all . like a hypnosis hangover . one-time deal , don ' t worry about it .
no . it should be dry by now .
what time ' s he coming home ?
friend ? yeah , we all got friends , <person> . i ' m warning you , <person> away from this one . back off , italian boy . you ' re getting too close to this one .
<person> , i know what i ' m doing . trust me . what ' s the news .

a phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range .
i didn ' t ask if you wanted milk .
no . a little sugar though .
you know , somebody tailin ' ya . a torpedo or somethin ' .
no , not a thing .
what is it ?
poached salmon .
i think so . i tried to get into your cab one night , and now you want to come and take me away .
<person> ' t you want to go ?
well , iris , i look at it this way . a lot of girls come into my cab , some of them very beautiful . and i figure all day long men have been after them : trying to touch them , talk to them , ask them out . and they hate it . so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all . so i don ' t say a thing . i pretend i ' m not even there . i figure they ' ll understand that and appreciate me for it . it takes iris a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking : i am loved to the extent i do not exist .
do you really think i should go to the commune ?
forget it , <person> ' n ' <person> . you ' re not makin ' me talk .
suit yourself . <continued_utterance> get me dillinger .
i ' m sorry -- i just --

well we certainly know that ' s true .
i can stop monsters , <person> . and because i can , i have to .
so is it a calling or a curse ?
erect . you know , a `` boner ? '' i ' d heard that it gives you a boner , to shoot a man .
would you excuse me , please ? <continued_utterance> would you consider leaving here pretty soon ?
<person> na have to .
or you could tie me in a sack , throw me in the river . tell the police you thought it was oddly-wrapped lard .
how about two men ? how about three ? how about public executions , that might work .
you ' re welcome to wait outside .
i didn ' t need you to take the blame for me , i ' m quite .
i didn ' t do it for you . believe me . <continued_utterance> she already hates me . you ' ve seen to that .

go to the sunset sheraton . right now ! just go ! go ! <continued_utterance> <person> shit . he ' s jacking her in to
the scimitar will serve my needs .
but surely --
just do it .
come again ?
for a drive . i don ' t know when we last went out .
this is absolutely yummy .
but that ' s what happened .
but it ' ll stop the movie .
incidentally , what happened to that doll ? - you gave me the item last night . still alive ?
<person> . at bellevue . still hanging on . but they still don ' t know if she was pushed .
who knows . where ' d you learn cpr ?
medical school . before i dropped out . i had a moment of clarity : in anatomy class i realized i ' d rather draw bodies than cut them up . and when i realized i couldn ' t make art , i decided to sell it .
examination and interview materials are confidential . we ' ve never violated an applicant ' s trust , and we never will .
you want to see a violation ? this is a violation . <continued_utterance> her name is <person> , she was just id ' d . i met her on a slab in west virginia . and sometime tomorrow , or tomorrow night , he ' s going to do the same thing to <person> .
no ! i ' ve got more than one shirt !
she can do that stuff for you . <person> , just wear some of my things , wear anything you want , most of it ' s ancient .
general . i ' m not in politics . you can have this back . i won ' t use it .
because you don ' t have the balls . did you expect me to get all weepy with gratitude ? you serve your country . is there anything else ? hub would love to just . clock him . instead:
i always hoped i would hit two meters .
with a full head of hair .
with my thing . will you be mingling ?
sure . if you feel safer .
a girl . you know .
no . never .
a girl needs a little romancing before she -
next time i ' ll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling !
what did you do ?
nothing . <person> , i want to talk to you about . well . <person> said to ask you . <continued_utterance> see , the place where i can connect with <person> is my photography . because she loves video and all . <continued_utterance> she ' s been talking about this little editing machine , it ' s only .
you mentioned that he had a learning disability .
that ' s right .
that doesn ' t sound too good for business .
it ' s kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing . it ' s kinda cool . it ' s like you ' re in on some kind of secret . you tell a chick you ' ve been some place , it ' s like bragging that you know how to find it . the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there . you have to have someone come before . there is a direct line connecting you back to the original , unequivocally cool , club patrons . it ' s kinda like <person> .
he starts this - buzzing in me , in my head . he makes me feel violated . you used me , mr . <person> .
number one . maybe there ' s a connection , maybe not . lying and breathing are the same thing to <person> . number two . if i ' d sent you in there with something to hide from him , he ' d have known it , instantly . he ' d never have trusted you . she starts to answer , then is silent . he is right . <continued_utterance> number three , i didn ' t bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics . if <person> is becoming part of this case , you ' ve got the most current read on him . and <person> - you don ' t have to like me , or the way i do things . but you do have to keep a cool head . especially now . because from here on out , you ' ll know everything i do . are we straight on that ?
. piece of shit . <person> , <person> , this is my friend rob from <person> . <person> .
hi .
you ought to take it easy <person> . you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley , but those little skyhoppers are dangerous . keep it up , and one day , whammo , you ' re going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall .
look who ' s talking . now that you ' ve been around those giant starships you ' re beginning to sound like my uncle . you ' ve gotten soft in the city .
really .
but -- wait .
i went after the kid . you still want that parker guy ' s data , don ' t you ?
well , did you get it ?
a bodyguard ? ! oh , <person> ! they didn ' t tell us it was that serious !

yeah it ' s good , mate , thriving .
i was reading the other day that it ' s a good time to be in the drugs trade . government ' s raging war on terror . no one gives a fuck about drugs anymore .

<person> ? that ' s d-list ' s car .
and she likes <person> .
<person> .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
<person> , when you meet someone and you ' re attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
i bought a bottle of them yesterday . <continued_utterance> converted to pdf by www . screentalk . org <number> .

where ' s the boy ?
i won ' t be doing this much longer .
it ' s okay , cole . <person> ' t be frightened . <continued_utterance> my name is dr . <person> . i was supposed to meet you today . <person> i missed our appointment . <continued_utterance> do you mind if i sit down ? i have this injury from a couple of years ago and it flares up every once in a while just so i won ' t forget it . <continued_utterance> your eye frames . they don ' t seem to have any lenses in them .
they ' re my dad ' s . the lenses hurt my eyes .

sometimes i hate you just because you are so american . it makes me want to hurt you . i think about fucking you and hurting you .

yeah , <person> . you know anybody by that name ?
no . hillbilly , you ' d better get your wise ass outa here and quick , or you ' re gon na be in trouble . travis is being propelled by an inner force , a force which takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control .

yeah . i ' m ghosting pretty bad . <continued_utterance> she came to me for help . i should have read it better . i just figured , y ' know . another strung- out hooker having a bad night .
he said , ' could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , ' you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? ' shakes his head , with a wry , disgusted smile .

<person> .
<person> , hard to port , target hard to port !
well , you ' ve spotted me and so you get the reward .
what ?
mortgage lenders and financing .
<person> ' s pregnant again . did you know that ? he ' s never going to leave her . <continued_utterance> god , you ' re pathetic .
put that down . hey ! that ' s my dinner !
how you get so big , eating food of this kind ?
i just wanted you to know i ' ve decided not to go to the wedding , so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable , you know , run-in or something , well , worry no more . you won ' t see me there . my wedding gift to you and what ' s- his-name . what is his name ?
<person> .
great .
how about this ?
it shouldn ' t be any harder than general motors was . but now . this is what i get for using humans .
now , wait a minute -- i wrote you .
<person> has already named <person> . <continued_utterance> he gave us a perfectly good description , and we ' re on it now , so we won ' t be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his , either . he ' s under close guard at the courthouse , pending a prison transfer . the next plane , <person> .
<person> , doesn ' t this `` <person> '' strike you as - i don ' t know - kind of vague ?
<person> ?
you were right . about me . and about <person> . we ' ve kept too much from each other . <continued_utterance> i usually report in at <number> . today i was there early . i was there when the call came in . your call .
that ' s thoughtful .
yeah .
i don ' t think so .
i heard them talking . they both thought you were money .
so right .
who ' s <person> @ jjpny . com . ? <continued_utterance> oh , shit -- that ' s him , right ?
that ' s right , she ' s safe .
. well , then .
mph .
<person> !
i didn ' t come here to see a house .
i ' m trying to tell you . this is an enormous place . <person> master bedrooms . a sunken tub in every bathroom . there ' s a bowling alley in the cellar . it ' s lonely here , so she got herself a companion . a very simple set-up : an older woman who is well-to-do . a younger man who is not doing too well .
no father , they ' re edgy . on alert . like they act when they smell a predator around . peeing on themselves and everything . <continued_utterance> what ' s wrong ?
i don ' t hear my children .
i ' m not going to kill you , <person> ' <person> .
<person>f course you will . i ' ve seen it .
not now , captain .
<person> .
mr . <person> ? i ain ' t got all day , here !
<person> . q-u-o-y-l- . no , y , then l-e . <person> , it ' s my kid .
what honey ?
if you want me to hate her i will .
he needed to be brought down a peg or two .
i ' m sure you pulling a groin muscle humbled him .
i ' ll make it short .
<person> . it ' s your baby now .
and i have looked down the road . at what my life will be . and i can ' t handle it .
what do you see ? down that road .
i thought she had yoga on saturdays .
still , it ' s not cool .
<person> , we ain ' t that much fussy anyway . there ' s always opening on one fleet or another . <person> out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk , and leave your phone number . you got ta phone ?
no .
<person> ' t need a lecture . you fucking told maya , didn ' t you ?
no , i did not . must have been <person> at the hitching post . i think we mentioned it to him the first night .
you ' re a liar .
i swear it . he wants <person> for <person> and the admiral ' s men .
they must never again leave this city .
that was never a condition of our agreement , nor was giving <person> to this bounty hunter !
now i ' m late . bye .
<person> to this --
<person> , if he ' s replacing anyone , it ' s me . and all the statistics say divorced men almost always remarry . that ' s just the way they ' re built .
<person> , you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life ? why i ' m always with the wrong guy ? this is why . because the wrong guy can ' t do this to you . you have some control with the wrong guy . this thing i ' m feeling right now . this is my big fear . that some guy could get me unglued like this , like nothing ' s connected . and this is just my father ! i ' m just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama .
stay with you .
that ' s impossible- .
. i will .
. <person> --
juggle it ! move the darkroom into your house . you ' ve got that room downstairs with the treadmill <person> never uses anyway . <person> ' t lose your confidence . <person> ' t lose your edge .
it ' s the same choice you made .
fucking-a it ' s five clicks ! at one point i had to cut through an ostrich farm . fuckers are mean . <continued_utterance> we got ta go back .
what ?
what was that , sir ?
about the time paradox . how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
are you alright -- ?
just some tinnitus in my left ear -- <continued_utterance> i need to know what i don ' t know .
well what were they paying you for . ?
<person> , i saw the sign .
i don ' t care -- i ' m not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me .
you little fool -- if you go to <person> with that man -- you stand to lose everything .
um , excuse me . <person> . excuse me . mr . <person> . <continued_utterance> what the fuck are you doing ?
coming with you .
<person> , but those grosses are inflated .
you think so ?
stand by to initiate pattern recall .
go for pattern recall .
get out of here .
<person> is dead . she ' s a copy . a facsimile . and she ' s seducing you all over again . you ' re sick . you think of fucking her as research for humanity . it ' s just fucking . <continued_utterance> there ' s nothing grandiose about it . you ' ve jumped out of a plane and you ' re trying to sew a parachute together while you fall . <continued_utterance> it ' d be hilarious if it weren ' t so damn sad . and leaves .
no .
i feel like i ' m going crazy here . you ' re <person> . but he ' s dead . i don ' t know what ' s real anymore . i can ' t be here with you . <continued_utterance> do you understand what i ' m saying to you ? you can keep the car . that should be enough for gas from here to there . <person> let me go .
because they look the same .
the septuagint scholars mistranslated the hebrew word for `` young woman '' in to the greek word for `` virgin '' , because they thought they looked the same , coming up with the prophecy `` behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son '' . but there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a volante and a fuckin <person> .
<person> haircut . so it wasn ' t a serious . ?
no , no . no . and then i , i held the post until relieved . <person> motions at scott .
yes .
that ' s great .
every day if we want . <continued_utterance> it ' s my turn .
<person> luck , <person> .
i gave her some advice on an idiotic script .
it ' s that old familiar story , you help a timid little soul across a crowded street . she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money .
to new worlds .
new worlds . yes <person> , brave new worlds .
but , as you are so fond of observing , <person> , i ' m not human .
you ' re not going in there -- !
what looks pretty good ?
yeah . that ' ll do nicely .
your manner .
my manner ? <person> don ' t you go downstairs , get a cup of coffee and calm down ? what ' s the matter , <person> ? what ' s going on with you ? what ' s wrong ?
<person> you .
<person> you , you cunt . you ' re just jealous cos you didn ' t think of it first . you ' re not that fucking smart .
no , but as i say , the type is rare .
and the blood could <continued_utterance> you scraped the dried blood from the <continued_utterance> no bits of bone , no particles of scalp , no strands of hair ?
he ' s fun ? how is he fun ? he ' s like . . wrong .
<person> can be fun , <person> .
hold on , hold on there , captain ! at ease ! let ' s calm down and remember . remember we ' re soldiers .
<person> plan , colonel .
<person> your pulse . the situation has worsened . the fire on the tracks caused one of the freight cars to blow up and release some kind of gas . as a precaution they ' re having to evacuate all of lower manhattan . <continued_utterance> we may have lost the initiative .
what do you mean ? let ' s keep going .
the finest smoothies in the state ! ! !
now , everyone ' s a little tense , except me , of course . so to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax , we need <continued_utterance> <person> <number> of <number> the right soundtrack . <person> ? <continued_utterance> this is little tune i like to call the paradise slide . one , two , a one two three .
how ' s that about your being my friend ?
<person> ' t you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach ? once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut , you ' re through .
that ' s good . that ' s good . where do you live now ?
kind of all over the place .
do you mind ?
oh . <continued_utterance> captain , do you realize what -- but <person> interrupts as he sees something o . c .
what ?
you mean you need a witness in addition to white ?
of course you do . a tuxedo and tails .
tails . that ' s ridiculous .
it ' s completely boring . you ' ll hate it . <person> here .
have you got anything to tell me , <person> ?
oh , no . oh , <person> . no , you don ' t .
you need a new car anyway . <continued_utterance> i said i ' d pay for it .
it is . a lotta people know . unfortunately , the easiest people to convince , the believer types , they also tend to be the dumbest . and people who demand proof -- well , this isn ' t something we can control , it comes when it comes , so if you can ' t make it happen , how can you prove it ? it ' s like that singing frog in the cartoon , but when the guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk . <person> laughs , horribly . he likes that cartoon . neil some of us try anyway . i say who needs that kind of aggravation ?
this all started when i was hypnotized . is that how it always is ?
thank you .
read the card .
just <person> .
and i am see-threepio , human-cyborg relations , and this is my counterpart , <person>-detoo .
did there come a time when all the children had been picked up ?
yes .
bitches and gats !
when we steal all the money ?
why did you do it , <person> ?
so i can fire him . i hate him . <person> and he quarrelled last night . <person> lied about it and i made a fool of myself . he ' s outside now .
i should ' ve said <person> , right ? it went over her head .
<person> , you did fine .
<person> is a real drag . everybody hates me .
oh-huh .
<person> ' t do it .
you know one of the ways movies still have <person> beat ? because they always say `` the end . `` you always know when it ' s over . it ' s over ! now please leave . i have to go on again in a couple of minutes . <continued_utterance> hell .
as in the textile <person>s . trying to shrug off the dress . i travel under my mother ' s name , too .
<person> .
come on , <person> , i ' m starving . how long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen ?
that ' s antonia . <continued_utterance> wait a minute . <continued_utterance> the future . what are you talking about ? this is the past . <continued_utterance> this is nine years ago . the day i told her i was going back to <person> . <continued_utterance> these were ktarian eggs -- her favorite . i was cooking them to soften the blow . and i gave her this .
<person> . you ' re hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
and who am i hiding from ?
yes . i agree . <person> ' t it amazing .
he ' ll be back . we haven ' t heard the last of him . the imagination . he ' ll find a way . could we talk about something else ? our guest of honor tonight- it ' s such a pleasure to meet you- but . the guest of honor from the un leans forward .
anything bubee .
will you come out to dinner tonight with me and dad and the fiance ?
i appreciate that , colonel .
i don ' t mean to be insensitive , but what , exactly , are your capabilities at this point ? your . infrastructure --
we don ' t have watches .
you don ' t have watches ?
you connected <person> and <person> ?
i couldn ' t sleep .
i can ' t . it ' s too big .
size matters not . <person> at me . judge me by my size , do you ? hm ? mmmm . <continued_utterance> and well you should not . for my ally in the force . and a powerful ally it is . <person> creates it , makes it grow . its energy surrounds us and binds us . luminous beings are we . . not this crude matter . you must feel the force around you . here , between you . me . the tree . the rock . everywhere ! yes , even between this land and that ship !
i can take it if i want it .
sure -- if you want -- but you ' ll have to beat my hand with four cards .
looks like you were in a bad car accident .
i ' m hungry .
<person> , i hope that i am not interrupting .
oh of course you ' re not interrupting <person> , i put the do not disturb sign on the door because i wanted you to join us .
<person> down . <person> , i didn ' t want to tell you this , but we ' ve had some problems with our protection program lately .
like what ?
it ' s open .
fill it up .
do me a favour , i ' ve probably put your fucking kids through college , do you know what i mean ?
mate , keep your voice down .
cloners ? are they friendly ?
it depends .
sure .
he ' s as big as <person> , maybe even bigger . in this neck of the woods , he ' s probably <person> and <person> rolled into one .
damn the calculations ! my god , <person> , you have to hear me ! the world we know will collapse ! everything we have devoted our lives to . all the patterns , all the harmonies . everything will be destroyed .
a new world waits ! <person> ! it is my destiny ! ! !
i mean . the white one ! <continued_utterance> the white dog with the big teeth and the red eyes . the skinny ghost owns him . they came last night . <continued_utterance> i didn ' t dream ' em , don ' t say i did .
i was gon na say . i ' ll keep my eyes peeled . <continued_utterance> be cheaper to build a new one . on the riviera , even .
well . i suppose it does a bit . i ' m very happy for them , of course , but i ' m going to miss them . the ship will seem . incomplete without them .
that is because you have a familiarity with them . you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge .
<person> , that ' s a field job . it ' s outside the scope of my assignment . and i ' ve got a test tomorrow on -
do you recall my instructions to you , starling ? what were they ?
well , come on . it ' s getting late . i only hope we can get back before <person> really blows up .
if you don ' t mind my saying so , sir , i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you ' ve gotten him back to your workshop .
uh huh . and i said , ' that ' s good , because i like the feeling of someone watching me . i acquired the taste from <person> . '
and then she said , ' since we ' re going to be spending so much time together -- '
oh , just that he loves her . that she ' s the only woman who has ever really rocked his world . how he adores <person> . how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to .
i ' m sure he believed every word . <continued_utterance> please believe me . i was even on the verge of telling you last night , but .
right . the report . report and recommend . <continued_utterance> what does <person> think you should do ?
<person> thinks we shouldn ' t leave until we figure out a way to document it , to prove its existence to the planet earth . this is hilarious : he thinks it ' s god , but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home .
well . because it ' s in the bible . `` thou shalt not . `` thou shalt not . <continued_utterance> excuse me -- just what are you all doing here ? at sunday school ?
' cause we love it so damn much . and cause we got ta come here . probation .
oh . well . how are you going to get it home ?
taxi . i guess . <continued_utterance> you must spend a lot of time with this spider-man guy . <person> ! <person> ' t you think you ought to unplug that !
how do you know you saw it ?
i don ' t know .
but it ' s only <person> . i ' ll come .
it ' s completely boring . you ' ll hate it . <person> here .
. <person> .
have you gotten laid
it ' s alright . he means it .
i do mean it . and i mean this . if <person> stays you go away and never come back . you scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again . you understand ? she glares at them both for a long moment . emotions play across her face , complex and unreadable . she steps back , taking her place at <person> ' s side .
say -- it don ' t sound as if it ' s goin ' to be too easy for them wimmen at the k . c .
want to go back and work for them ?
<person> two to <person> one . again ; proceed to port nine .
affirmative , two .
you ' re welcome , cole . <continued_utterance> you know when i was in school , there was a terrible fire in this section of the theater . they rebuilt the whole thing .
i know .
so she wasn ' t just a bitch in high heels ? <continued_utterance> <person> ' t stress . she mighta heard worse from her momma . i ' m only guessin ' .
some people probably thought <person> was bad clear through .
i dunno .
a lot artists don ' t like to title their work . they feel it biases the viewer .
<person> , `bout that .
raising his voice over the
can you sleep ?
i don ' t think do . it ' s not sleep ; it ' s something else . it ' s all around me .
i hope it ' s the right kind .
are you <continued_utterance> i
i like my dog to growl at the post man .
<person> ready for tonight ?
and a share . we will be partners , mr . <person> !
partners !
what ? what did she say ? does she think i ' m a good guy ? what did she say ?
it was something like , `` i ' ll fully blow him tonight . ``
why , you like the duck with the cigar ?
<person> . nice touch . it ' s the logo from `` you bet your life '' , right ?
but of course .
<person> or surrounded ?
regula i is a scientific research laboratory , if memory serves .
i told <person> all we had was a boatload of children but we ' re the only ship in the quadrant . <person> : those cadets of yours -- how good are they ? how will they respond under real pressure ?
she can ' t live here . her daughter .
<person> . her daughter can also live with us for the summer .
and we ' re the bait .
well , he ' s on his way .
i ' m an old friend of cochrane ' s .
<person> for him you came by when you did . he might be dead now .
i ' ve got a little challenge for you , <person> -- a new recruit . he ' s a tough case , but i want him treated in the usual manner . train him for the games . let him hope for a while . and blow him away .
you ' ve got it . i ' ve been hopin ' you ' d send me somebody with a little moxie . what kind of program is he ?
how serious is the damage ?
i ' m having trouble scanning underground . there ' s a lot of radiation leaking from something .
-- so who are you afraid of betraying ? you know these people . they bomb , they maim . do they represent the palestine you want to build ? they ' re using you .
you are using me , too ! everybody uses the palestinians ! we are the whores of the middle east ! you make reports about our little talks -- ? what about fucking me ?
it ' s already gone .
i understand what you mean .
because sadly i ' m still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land .
<person> .
good idea . meantime , try to get a feel for <person> . her apartment , her friends . how he might ' ve stalked her . i ' m going to the other two clinics , <person> and ohio . <person> ' s the hardest part , starling . use your anger , don ' t let it keep you from thinking . just keep your eyes on catherine . we ' ve got less than <number> hours .
mr . <person> . can those cops down there handle dr . <person> ?
extracted ? extracted by whom ? i see .
his name is <person> bin <person> . he ' s iraqi . and something of a religious leader .
for a fee .

<person> .
how ' s that working out , by the way ?
good . thank you . now that i have it on . why are you laughing ? you don ' t even know what that means .
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more , then i shall be the sorrier . <continued_utterance> the queen commands a comedy , <person> for <person> .
a comedy ! what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom , sick with love ?
he quit ?
he has gone to the line camp at <person> .
no , i haven ' t . i suppose all the waxworks are coming ?
i don ' t know , sir . <person> made the arrangements .
he reacts vigorously , protesting : <continued_utterance> that ' s fish four days old . ! i can ' t buy it , <person> ! right out of that mouth i love , like you ' re a ventriloquist ' s dummy , your brother is saying goodbye ! gee ! . you want me to be honest , don ' t you ? !
a despairing cry : <continued_utterance> no , <person> , i don ' t . i don ' t . not if it kills me i don ' t ! .
does he know that ?
well , i ' ll tell him , but i doubt that he thinks of it that way .
i knew there was a sound explanation . <continued_utterance> what was that you were saying before with your soldiers ? day pro fun .
. <person> profundis clamo ad te domine . <continued_utterance> it ' s called <person> . it ' s a language .

he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , they send him to the nut-hut for a while .
<person> .

ever since <person> , you ' ve been different . kind of distracted , distant . but i feel like you ' re coming back from wherever you were .
i am . i was just . i just got . i think i got nervous . it ' s normal , right ? <person> ' t you ever feel nervous about , you know ?
<person> well , let ' s wrap him up .
what do you want to do that for ?
about seven or eight minutes .
computer -- this is commander deanna troi . initiate self- destruct in six minutes , thirty seconds . authorization troi , gamma six five . enable .
we can ' t go down there . we ' re not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , <person> . we ' re just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
well , you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here . in the ocean . <number> percent of the earth ' s surface is water , norman . that ' s first grade geography .
<person> ' t even say that . you ' ve got to find that file before he does .
not much chance of that now . the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it .
<person> ! we ' re all off to utica , so excuse me , mr . frannis-on-the- portisan . <person> moves toward the doorway onto the corridor . the chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth .
but can i ask one impertinent question here ? with no criticism intended , because i know , <person> , you earn your ten percent , how come you let a sock act like <person> <person> tip-toe through town without a publicity build . ?
wow . do you make sushi ?
we took a class a while back -- and when he walks in the door at seven- thirty , i am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table - -- covered with homemade sushi .
. we can ' t lose the wind .
then i can ' t do this shot . you wants me to push in -- i can ' t push in through the window . we go back to new hampshire ?
speed -- two hundred , seventy-five thousand kilometers per second .
there ' s no temporal shielding in here ! we ' re starting to pick up relativistic effects !

<person> .

what ' s going on ?
she covered that camera . i don ' t think she liked me watching her .
he ' s still looking for that old file .
i would if i could find it . it ' s stashed somewhere off in the system . out of my range . meanwhile .
let it finish , then . no harm in that , i guess . <continued_utterance> all of you are in deep shit , i promise you . as for <person> , he ' ll never make it off this base .
i don ' t think that ' s where he ' s headed .
i ' ll take care of it , sir .
number one . you have the bridge .
my grandmother ' s rich .
<person> down , slow down .
oh yeah , i ' m really gon na eat carbohydrates .
what ' d you do , build this . ?
that ' s right .

every combat simulator has one . in the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno . <continued_utterance> you ' re an unusual choice for a distraction .
and you ' re a moron .
you talked to his wife ? <continued_utterance> my wife talks to his wife about what shift i ' m gon na take ?
what ' s the difference ? <continued_utterance> unless there ' s some particular reason why it feels better to be around her at night . <continued_utterance> is there , <person> ? <continued_utterance> what , what is it ? is it serious or what . ? quit looking at me like that ! what ' s with this ridiculous silence ? ! <continued_utterance> goddamn . i never thought this would happen to me . you fuckin ' sonofabitch . <continued_utterance> i just want you off the case . get off it , or don ' t come home . and i want you to remember . when we ' re old . that when this awful thing happened . i behaved like a lady . the kind of `` lady '' you apparently prefer .
yep .

we don ' t release him . a judge releases him . you ' re an fbi man . that ' s what judges are good at , right ? it ' s not like we ' ve gone after him in proper prosectorial fashion . kidnaping him . holding him in isolation . `` fruit of the poisoned tree '' -- remember that one from law school ? oh , we ' ll have a big trial . everybody ' ll get their rocks off . but the fact is -- -- the sheik will walk . <continued_utterance> . and this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle . <continued_utterance> documentary evidence of <person> ' s whole operation .
<person> out my heart ! throw my liver to the dogs !
no , then .
it was my father ' s , sir .
he carry it over there ?
how did you do that , <person> ?
elementary physics . a beam of energy can always be diverted . ooh , my head are we there yet , <person> ?
nobody in this town really understands <person> . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually , he ' s the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .
unfortunately what he wants is you .
what is it ?
this tie doesn ' t go with blue !
that ' s very interesting , let ' s stay up all night like the old days and discuss it .
i have to be at work in a few hours .
bought it .
it ' s not your taste .
three . how much money you got in your pocket ?
ten .
who are you talking to ?
<person> . this guy seemed a little .
because of your mother ?
i don ' t know why i keep dreaming about her now . i haven ' t seen her since i was little .
but maybe one day , she ' ll put the bitterness behind her and find a new love .
<person> ' t be daft . she ' s old , you big sop . a parked <number> x <number> looms out of the mist .
he wants me to break a leg ?
no , an arm , he said . i told him you were sure the item would be in mr . <person> ' s column in tomorrow ' s .
am i in there ?
no , but some of your classmates are . <person> , <person> .
well , i ' m very , very disappointed to hear that . it makes me feel like a fool .
we weren ' t close . but we were connected . in a bad way .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . <person> was looking at you tonight .
all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father ' s fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . <person> above all .
we haven ' t been issued weapons , sir .
you won ' t need weapons , <person> .
i ' ll make gretsky bleed , the little bitch .
pause it .
tell me about it . you pour industrial bleach right on `em . nothing .
just roll their eyes and call you a pussy .
nothing . it was my attempt at humour .
well , uh , maybe i kidnapped her so you ' d be forced to work with me . there ' s my attempt at humour .
did she read the script ?
demille is <person> . i ' m <person> . <person> has been transmitting <person> for weeks . today is the day of greatest conjunction . now turn around . let me dry you .
<person> wait a minute , are you telling us that this chip somehow knows if the kid is swearing ?
it ' s just like a lie detector . certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie , the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock . <continued_utterance> we are very excited to see the results of this test . <person> <number> , would you step out here , please ? <person> steps out wearing a hospital gown . <continued_utterance> <person> <number> here has been fitted with the new v-chip .
you don ' t have to know . i know enough for both of us . change in there .
what is this ?
another one , but to you , man ! everyone , to this guy ! who the fuck are you , man ?
seth !
uh . maybe ?
' <person> i will <person> you faster than you can say `` fat-assed lesbian ! ''
varies .
could a four year old keep a diary ?
<person> . the man you want to volunteer to help elect president .
oh , i think he ' s a wonderful man .
i ' m not crazy .
it was a mistake . no big deal .
<person> . you are a woman to love .
you are woman to love . what the hell does that mean ?
all thanks to dad and his secretary .
<person> .
how amazing .
it is , isn ' t it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life .
i don ' t want to make it . i came here to get you out .
you want to make it like this ?
yes , i was once a <person> knight the same as your father .
i wish i ' d known him .
and then maybe a swimwear collection , a chat show , a pasta sauce range ?
what ?
<person> , is there anything you want to say to me ? that i can tell my people here ?
the guy ' s just breathing into the phone , maybe they ' re not even <person> .
the man with the pipe isn ' t here right now .
let me talk to him . this isn ' t right . i ' m not your prisoner .
<person> ?
you know my name ?
bumped his head .
i see . looks like he ' s going to need a couple or so stitches . <person> get him upstairs .
no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away .
<person> , you have your actors .
what else ? keep on keepin ' on . <continued_utterance> she has to stick with it . have the patience , the guts , to ignore the pain . you disagree ?
hey . you oughta know .
<person> ! <continued_utterance> it is very good that you did not ask , `` why ? ''
keep things real , right ?
it ' s the <person> , captain . state-of-the-art ergonomics .
i told him you ' re comfortable with your old chair .
i guess you ' re lucky .
do you really think so . ? i suppose i shouldn ' t expect .
i see , sir <person> .
just <person> .
when i found you ?
if i didn ' t go .
<person> , its for you .
<person> , i want you to meet a friend of mine . say hi to <person> .
am i in it ?
a guy like you is in it but he ' s not you .
i thought i saw a black widow spider . <person> looks at victoria , shrugs . back to jonah .
what are you doing up ?
it ' s like . it ' s like this big pissed off god up in your face just screaming at you . so close you can smell the metal on his breath .
sounds great .
well , yes .
then let this bunch of jerks see class .
then we ' d be living a lie - one we couldn ' t keep even if we wanted to . mt sister saw it . so did my mother . i couldn ' t do that . could you , <person> ? could you live like that ?
. no , you ' re right . it would destroy us .
it doesn ' t make any sense .
we think it might . that ' s why we brought you here . we ' ve assembled your team -- they ' re waiting for us now .
nothing for me . i understand there ' s something urgent you need to discuss with me .
yes . i need to return to the observatory immediately . i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star .
your first novel ? you ' re going to dash one off just like that ?
ideally , i ' d like to make it into fiction before i ' m thirty .
aside from the space issue . why ' d you move to new york ?
to fall in love . <continued_utterance> what ? that ' s corny , right ?
it isn't .
<person> ! <person> , are you in there ?
<person> , please stop .
she wanted me to tell you , she saw you dance . <continued_utterance> she said when you were little , you and her had a fight right before your dance recital . you thought she didn ' t come to see you dance . she did . <continued_utterance> she hid in the back so you wouldn ' t see . she said you were like an angel . <continued_utterance> she said , you came to her where they buried her . asked her a question . she said the answer is `` everyday . `` <continued_utterance> what did you ask ?
<person> .
let him fly . but we better start seeing product . <continued_utterance> any more surprises for me ?
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you ' ve talked with mr . <person> .
be careful , <person> .
we can come back later if that ' s better .
i can ' t believe i have to deal with this now . my son just died for <person> ' s sake .
do you fear them ?
<person> ' t you ?
i believe art and politics should be separate , but that they weren ' t kept separate i learned to my cost .
and when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ?
shore -- you told me how <person> and <person> tried to frame stan .
yeah . like they wanted to be sure he ' d keep his mouth shut about something . <person> sits down on a box sitting against the wall , directly under the large earthen jug of water .
always , always . always .
you made my life wonderful . <continued_utterance> <person> that with you , too .
i ' m gon na tell you , but when i do , just say nothing . <person> ' t judge me . just be my friend . <person> ?
fine . <person> .
<person> you , you cunt . you ' re just jealous cos you didn ' t think of it first . you ' re not that fucking smart .
i didn ' t think of it , cos i ' m not that fucking stupid .
she ' s . . . really good . up to her old tricks .
now if i wanted to see her . how would that go over ?
she looks like a bug .
you wan na sack your stylist girl .
not while i ' m in training .
do you have a boyfriend ?
wish me luck .
break a leg . . partner .
<person> ' t pay him any mind , sweetheart .
you ' re a nice guy , <person> , but if you got two wives - i ain ' t into no polybigamy . <person> is silent . he takes the club out of her hand . she steps away - startled - then turns and jogs away . <person> throws down his club in a fury .
so . she ignores this little kovitsky punk , takes the high moral ground . <continued_utterance> he ' s relentless . a major asshole .
and you said .
then how come your off duty light wasn ' t on . travis switches on the off duty light .
it was on .
i hate the press cases . especially the weird press cases . where you going ?
to make a statement . i ' m gon na give them the name . maybe the jackals can help us out for once . <continued_utterance> if they can get this on the tube by eleven , she may just call us . how do i look ?
i think the facts speak for themselves . the same noble <person> blood runs in our veins . had you lived my life , you ' d be doing exactly as i am . look in the mirror , and see yourself . <continued_utterance> consider that , captain . i can think of no greater torment for you .
it ' s a mirror for you as well . <person> turns back to him . a beat . <person> gazes at him evenly .
i know you ' re very angry ?
ahhhh . i ' m getting there , yes .
yes , yes , but .
`` . but still it rises up . it rises up , frank , high as it can go . ``
what the hell is going on ? !
i am the dark master !
yet can not love nor write it .
here is a bangle found in psyche ' s temple on olympus cheap at four pence . write your name on a paper and feed it in the snake .
what ?
i ' ve turned professional . what can i do ?
really ?
i had the christopher marlowe in my boat once .
<person> ' t be too sure .
now , ' limp dick ' , i know . what .
i ' ve just got to make one quick stop . <person> ' t take a second .
what ?
i don ' t want to know too much about my kid .
you think <person> is hiding things from us ? i tell you , i ' m getting to the bottom of this . my son has no involvements with any black frauds . <person> , you said something about crack ?
you ' ve been there ?
once or twice .
come on . you ' re fucking hungover .
<person> , there was a tasting last night . but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up . <person> out the box .
oh , uh . i don ' t remember too much .
sure , a little disorientation . that ' s normal , when they transport you . it ' ll come back to you . you ' re doing real well in training . remarkable , really .
if you ' ve changed your mind .
no , no . wait a minute . i take it you ' ve had the experience .
you ' re money .
<person> , baby . it ' s not that hard .
no way . not her type .
the trouble is <person> , you think like a loser . and i know that because i ' m the loser that losers turn to for tips . i ' m the losers loser .
i can ' t remember very much . what it looked like or how long i was there . but i do remember how it felt . <continued_utterance> it was like being inside . joy . as if joy was a real thing that i could wrap around myself . i ' ve never been so content .
but then you were beamed away .
here is a bangle found in psyche ' s temple on olympus cheap at four pence . write your name on a paper and feed it in the snake .
will it restore my gift ?
the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . <person> only calls for three drinks per extra .
<person> , <person> , can i stick around here for a while ?
ever since i ' ve known you .
i don ' t know about that .
come on .
what is it you say when you jump ?
will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night ?
oh , ' cause the phone doesn ' t ring as much at night and the `` alone '' thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to . but i got the hang of it . you got ta sleep in the middle of the bed . it ' s absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side .
you put it back in the wrong place . do you like <person> ?
they ' re kind of fuzzy .
<person> , if you don ' t mind , i haven ' t got time to listen to the whole plot .
i ' ll make it short .
indeed yes , <person> . i have to wade through a metre of water every morning .
no !
when do you have to be here ?
i do not understand .
you ' ve got to get hard for me . real hard .
i ' m . i ' m . i ' m about to . but first i just want to tell you exactly how i-
i trod in the sponge mix .
it ' s ok . it ' s ok .
it was from your point of view .
my point of view . exactly . the whole wedding was my point of view . i let the wedding get bigger than big . i am the reason he didn ' t get out of that car .
i ' m only allowed `` g '' movies .
am i the only one who cares about this ? at least i watched `` dog day afternoon ! ''
cutting it a little close , don ' t you think ? so how was she ? compared to <person> , say .
<person> as shit . flopping around like a landed trout .
how ' s that orange whip comin ' ?
so , i heard <person> busted out again ? <continued_utterance> hey <person> , you can whip my oranges anytime . <person> puts a barbie head earring on her left ear . <person> comes into the diner and slides into a booth . <person> walks over with a pot of coffee .
i mean we love each other as friends . but . <person> , you were sitting on all these incredible feelings . all tied up in that box with my pictures in desperate need of a love affair . and me . well , i needed to break the alec habit . and it ' s only natural i would turn to you in my confusion . but this doesn ' t feel real . it feels manufactured .
it ' s me , isn ' t it ?
hi , there .
special agent <person> . fbi .
you ' re trembling .
i ' m not trembling .
you ' re so smart , you call it .
i say that chubby fat-ass . let ' s see . fifth from the front . put me down for a quarter deck .
marty .
well that ' s very thoughtful of him . <person> .
but she could still be around ! hiding or something . i mean , she could have actually been here when you saw her !
if she was , she ' s very quick getting in and out of a room .
<person> left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma .
you know what a mixer ball is ? it ' s like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . <person> grumpily waves at him to sit .
do you know what he ' s been saying to her ?
he ' s an actor , so it can ' t be good .
you will . there will come a moment when you ' ll know . and if it ' s : yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window . with the past .
and i thought picking the place to meet was a challenge .
<person> ' s late .
<person> , uh , <person> and i broke up .
how do you know ?
ask her , she ' s a heroic fireperson .
what are you doing to counsellor troi ?
i ' m preparing her for <person> . to sooth him as she soothes you . to stand at his side as she does at yours .
we ' re all . mortal , soran . it ' s one of the truths of our existence .
what if i told you i found a new truth .
no one ever calls on that number .
<person> . <person> on .
of course i ' m with you .
it ' s drab . it ' s depressing . and every time i look out of the window i see <person> ' s arse - what ' s that about ?
what is the meaning of this attack ?
surely i have made my meaning plain . i mean to avenge myself upon you , admiral . i ' ve deprived your ship of power and when i swing round i mean to deprive you of your life --
wait a second --
<number> - <number> -deepsea delivery . i hear they ' re good .
that ' s not hard to do .
no , i mean really . this is nothing for a person to do .
well , i don ' t know anyone named obi- wan , but old ben lives out beyond the dune sea . he ' s kind of a strange old hermit . <continued_utterance> i wonder who she is . it sounds like she ' s in trouble . i ' d better play back the whole thing .
he says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system . he suggests that if you remove the bolt , he might be able to play back the entire recording .
<person> ' t be crazy . tell me every detail .
<person> , flor , yes i will . they should name a gender after you . looking at you doesn ' t do it . staring is the only thing that makes sense . and trying not to blink so you don ' t miss anything . <continued_utterance> look . forgive me . i ' m . it ' s just that you are drop-dead , crazy- gorgeous . so much so that i am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here .
they want our attention on the door ?
they ' re distracting us ?
theo . <person> .
hey man , welcome to our parking lot . lem me give you some advice , if she asks you to dance , make sure her brother ' s not around . <person> blew out <person> ' s pilot light , if you get my meaning .
but <person> yoda who could have erased information from the archives ? thats impossible , isn't it ?
much harder to answer , that question is .
yeah . two blue crushes please .
coming up .
that ' s all fine , lad , `` but this is the fleet '' .
you know you deliver him in the door , you know they ' re going to waste you .
can i take your order ?
but i am warning you .
are you a reporter ?
no .
you know , even i get boarded sometimes , <person> . i had no choice , but i ' ve got a charter now and i can pay you back , plus a little extra . i just need some more time .
put your blasters away . <person> , my boy , i ' m only doing this because you ' re the best and i need you . so , for an extra , say twenty percent i ' ll give you a little more time . but this is it . if you disappoint me again , i ' ll put a price on your head so large you won ' t be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life .
so do you .
there was a car crash , sweetie . and they found . you know , the body . of her friend .
what is it ?
some sort of lead or something .
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
it never solves anything .
not the best place to stand , fella .
no . it ' s me . you ' re the new helper , huh .
i can ' t help you with your writer ' s block -- until i see that look in dale biberman ' s eyes . the look that says she knows i ' m the one for her .
<person> , what about all the other women you were going out with ?
`` no '' ?
not fair . no contest . send two more of your old ones up . <continued_utterance> go ahead .
we enter first , take a look , then fill out the warrant .
tell me the difference between that and breaking-and-entering ?
and come to the printshop . you know why ? <continued_utterance> to print the newspaper . and i ' d come to write . to write . to write . right here in the office .
not without a rolltop desk .
<person> hot mommies ?
depends . how big you like `em ?
can you love a player ?
wait ! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent .
yeah , and make it extra muddy , i didn ' t sleep a zee last night . <person> fills a cup . <person> lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .
you don ' t need coffee , mr . <person> ; you need a vacation . <person> catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear .
does <person> know who this bookies belongs to ?
it . belongs to me now . <continued_utterance> if you know what ' s good for .
you don ' t know shit . <person> suffering <person> and her poor suffering people . it ' s called `` going native '' -- the most elementary error of an intelligence operative and she made it . she had all of you working for her and she was working for them without even knowing it . and now they ' re getting exactly what they want , which is the sheik will be back in the mix . but ten times as strong , because now he ' s the big man who stood up to the americans . i did what was necessary . i make no apologies . if you think you ' re going to be able to use that file against me , you know even less about politics than i imagined .
general . i ' m not in politics . you can have this back . i won ' t use it .
bring it , <person> .
`` my thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved . i can live only wholly with you or not at all . ``
hey , wait a minute .
now keep in mind , ' operation human <person> ' will suffer heavy losses . but don ' t lose your spirit men ! stay until the bitter end . <person> <number> ? <continued_utterance> right , you are ' operation get behind the <person> ' . you will follow <person> <number> here- he points to a spot on the <number> -d map . <continued_utterance> -and try not to get killed for <person> ' s <person> . are there any questions men ? <continued_utterance> yes soldier ?
oh , not as well as i ' d like . we ' re a small outpost and not very self-sufficient . and i ' ve had supply problems of every kind . i ' ve had labor difficulties . what ' s so funny ?
you . <person> to you - you sound like a businessman , a responsible leader . who ' d have thought that , huh ?
eight minutes and counting .
killing her ' s the only way --
i said , why would you ?
oh . i don ' t know .
she ' s counting on it . she ' s concerned for your safety , but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you . or a carnival .
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime ?
all right , i ' ll give it a try .
no ! try not . do . or do not . there is no try .
i got ways , <person> , i got ways . <person> , okay . i got a deal with some a the paramedics . my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue . so whaddya think ? this clip ' s got ta be worth at least a grand . <person> ?
<person> . not to dash your hopes , but i don ' t deal this kind of product , you know that . i ' ll give you four for it , cause i ' ve got ta cut off the last bit . and my customers want uncut .
uh , yes .
they ' re all down at <person> ' s last i saw . when you gon na tell him ?
i can ' t keep the vision out of my head . they ' re my friends . i ' ve got to help them .
you must not go !
i know you ' re right . but .
but what ?
what time is it ?
eleven a . m . they ' re gone . <continued_utterance> but they ' re not really gone . we just can ' t see them . early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the lights were hovering last night . <continued_utterance> it stopped dead in the air and fell straight down . <continued_utterance> they caught it on tape and they ' ve been playing it all morning . they found the bird . his head crushed in . when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky . they think they have some invisible shield thing going , like an optical illusion .
you think i did that ?
sure -- to draw us away from here . you know , you cut it mighty close -- good thing i ain ' t got brains enough to fill it . <continued_utterance> too bad you had to come ' way up here through that storm for nothin ' .
`` farewell ``
`` o think ' st thou we shall ever meet again ? methinks i see thee , now thou art so low , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb . either my eyesight fails , or thou lookest pale . ``
hi , <person> .
<person> , come ' stai bello il tuo pappa e ' in galera per la terza volta . <continued_utterance> i ' ll have the waitress bring you cappuccino .
that ' s impossible . i ' m not <person> .
who are you , then ?
and tell <person> to swing away .
what ? <person> ? . <person> ?
help you ? you ' ve destroyed my life and now you want me to help you ? ! you ' re always making me feel like a piece of shit .
come on guy , you know i only rib you because i love you so much !
so why are you asking me ?
i like talking about it . at least , to you .
traveling through hyperspace isn ' t like dusting crops , boy ! without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that ' d end your trip real quick , wouldn ' t it ?
what ' s that flashing ?
we do talk the same language -- don ' t we , <person> ?
sure , we talk the same language .
ahh , it is something .
no . look .
not believing you .
you ' re not sorry . you ' re scared . you ' re a psychologist , norman . you pride yourself on knowing when someone ' s lying to you , not telling you the truth . and now you ' re scared . because you ' re not sure you can tell anymore .
can i have one ?
right now ?
all in the cause of humanity , <person> . or should i call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one ?

i already got a real one . come on , it won ' t be too bad . it ' s not personal .
just not the eyes .
tell the baby about me .
i will .
<person> idea . take a few weeks off , get some sun , take <person> fishing --
a real change . new city . someplace where every time i go around a corner i don ' t think of maggie .
regardless of how i may feel about <person> . our fates lie along different paths . nothing can change that .
you want some advice ? <person> ' t do this again . you know exactly what i mean .
this is <person> . <person> , are you all right ?
everything ' s fine , commander . i ' ll explain when i see you . oh , by the way , we ' re bringing several guests aboard . prepare to beam up on my next signal . <person> out .

now your signature . not `` dickie '' . your signature .
without the glasses you ' re not even ugly . i don ' t need them because i never read . how do i look .
i ' m trying , honey . i ' m . look , is your ma , when is your mom coming ? oh . what did the midwife . ?

i don ' t think you do love me .
<number> % on the math final ! no one could be that dumb with numbers .
well , at least you didn ' t lose your lunch over a bug . how embarrassing .
i don ' t know . maybe they don ' t leave a canary . <person> ' t be technical . what i ' m saying is if this newsstand guy ' s italian and his fingers are gone , maybe he ' s a thief .
first , he ' s not italian . second he ' s not a thief . i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change . two of his fingers are missing . just stubs . like they were blown away . i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette . i couldn ' t help watching . i was dying to see how he ' d light it .
no , whoever got him here so fast should be thanked . another half hour and i don ' t know if this would ' ve worked . <person> pats her mom on the back .
oh , man . this was . intense .
well , no , i mean yeah i ' m fine , but listen . <person> , the craziest thing happened to me tonight .
